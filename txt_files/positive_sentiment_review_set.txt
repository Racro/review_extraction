It's not blocking ads on NBC News.
-------------------------
block
It's sooo good as it blocks every ads 100% recommend this!!!
-------------------------
block
Extremely useful, I recommend.
Of course no adblocker can block everything but this one does a fantastic job
-------------------------
block
so much good for any ad blocking
-------------------------
block
Very good Extension, it works very well in blocking ads on websites.
-------------------------
prevent
I had no idea that an ad blocker would prevent reCaptcha notices.  It allows me to stay human.
-------------------------
block
it does not block ads on youtube AT ALL.
-------------------------

EASILY the best ad-blocker I've ever found. Wanna block a specific element you don't like on a page? The feature to do so is readily available, just a few clicks, then bam, you have access to block anything possible. Wanna stop ad-blocking because you want to give a few cents to a kind stranger? Done, with nothing but a click within the menu. I definitely recommend getting it, because it not only works incredibly well, but others have mentioned how they've been using it for years without a problem in other reviews, and I've found proof of that firsthand. Not a single ad, no weirdness, nothing; it's genuinely near flawless. Easiest 10/10 of my LIFE.

Edit: yeah, I was right, I just didn't know how right I was. For any who somehow stumble across this review, if you have something like those premium subscription pop-ups that sometimes slip through, you can block those as well using the built-in feature. Just click the block option in the menu that pops up when you click on the extension next to the search bar at the top, and hover over what you want to block, then move the mouse around the general area until it highlights the full part of what you want to block, including its background. If you're having trouble going back to the normal page and you have been blocked from interacting with it, then you can open a new tab (or duplicate it), reload your current one, or press the back button. There's also an option to un-block something in the settings if you wish to do so, although you can just fully disable ad blocking for the specific page you're on within that same menu that you used earlier.
-------------------------
protect
Superb extension I have complete trust in it. It gets on with the job without any fuss and protects you from the annoying interruptions
-------------------------
block
Blocks all ads. If anything slips through, you can just click block element. Its free, its reliable, its Adblock Plus. Ive been using it for a long time, and it is probably the best extension I have. Its crucial for any pc.
-------------------------
block
i love it blocks lots of ads AND WORKS!!!!
-------------------------
block
200,932 ads blocked on my pc alone and rising. Numbers don't lie. Bravo!
-------------------------
block
I been using ABP for years now, fantastic product. Over 1.6 million ads blocked, amazing.

I also donate 1 - 2 times per year to help keep them going, huge value.
-------------------------
block
Have been using it forever, no problems ever, and it block YouTube ads as well. Thanks!!
-------------------------
block
Work exactly as you want with decent level of customization and blocking elements on demand. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
very good.. ABP blocks adds that were not effectively blocked by AB
-------------------------
block
This program used to be so much better. There's a lot more websites that still have ads that can't be blocked.
-------------------------
block
Absolutely wonderful.  Have been using for a while-and very pleased.  Was just on a webpage and noticed it had blocked 1217 just while I was on that page.  Yeah...ABP
-------------------------
block
nice extension for blocking ads my personal favourite
-------------------------
block
Perfect for blocking elements containing Marxist propaganda.
-------------------------
block
I hadn't had much of a problem with ads until recently.  I'm not sure why but ads started blocking just half of an article I was reading from a legitimate site. One of the features I like best about AdBlock Plus is that it will allow you to list the sites you like and it won't block them. Prior to buying AdBlock Plus, I had subscrrbed to a much more expensive blocking service that would do the same but it was a much more involved process. With AdBlock Pus, it's so easy.

I tried AdBlock first and liked it sii I switched to AdBlock Plus for its added benefits.  I think it's nice to  buy a service like AdBlock Plus that allows you to contribute the amount of money you think it's worth, without charging you a set amount. I figure I got added benefits that AdBlock didn't have and I'm helping the company to keep the free site available for others, while I get added features.  I really love AdBlock Plus and I highly recommend it to others!
-------------------------
block
I don't know how I actually got to be able to add this free ad block to my extensions on my pc but is being extremely great, like it shows the number of add it has blocked (250 in just how many website I've used) and does not allow to unnecessary redirection when I try downloading movies on my favourite web.... NETNAIJA :)
-------------------------
block
Very good, love that you can select an element and block it, not perfect since it's free, but with the custom element blocker it works great, it's free so definitely worth it.
-------------------------
block
Pretty good. No complaints. Even blocks ads on YouTube. Nice go, ABP.
-------------------------
block
Love it!! could you make it so that it blocks ads on spotify? Thanks!!
-------------------------
block
Awesome extension. It can block almost all ads except a few items but user can hide those exceptional ads manually. So I think it's okay. 
It's the best ad blocker as I used before.
-------------------------
block
This adblocker is very useful.While searching the web and such, or just watching stuff, ad's are a breeze with ABP. If you can't get Opera Gx, then I recommend ABP, as it blocks all the annoying lil' ads you might or might not see.
-------------------------
block
very good at blocking ads
-------------------------
block
good ad block ngl
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus blocks almost all the adds and gives us a true add free experience. I am loving this adblocker.
-------------------------
block
Thanks for this tool. blocks all adds
-------------------------
block
I am using it from around last one year and it blocks every pop-ups every ads(Hotstar,mx player,youtube etc) and with this I never have to waste my time by watching ads
-------------------------
block
The extension works well and blocked total of 50,566 ads inn a span of 1 year I think. But I do believe it used to be better in terms of not getting many ads. Now I do get ads on websites but I really do appreciate this extension very much so I gave it a good 4 stars.
-------------------------
block
i love this extension so much, im so happy that now i get to watch the videos i want to without seeing ads, i have 113 ads that have been blocked and im so surprised how many were in store for me, but props to you guys for doing that, i cant afford premium right now so i feel like i have premium by using this app, thanks so much
-------------------------
block
No ads, really it works, just tweak the extension settings to block all ads, else some ads will still be shown, this is important.
It even blocks ads on every YouTube video, it's a life saver. Greatest extention period.
Thanks for reading.
-------------------------
block
Works really well at blocking the vast majority of ads. When watching YouTube it can be a little buggy but and slow down it a bit, but it is overall faster than no ad block. Do recommend.
-------------------------
block
best ad blocker i love it, it even blocks youtube adds, so premium without premium.
-------------------------
block
Great for blocking those so annoying ads. Keep up the great work.
-------------------------
block
A great assist for blocking trash. Thank you so much.
-------------------------
block
Great app, works efficiently and out of sight, easy to cancel blocking for certain sites and pages.
-------------------------
block
does not block all ad
-------------------------
block
ABP got the blocks on lockdown. Extremely useful for Youtube specifically, no ads at all when viewing. That's really the extent of my use, but most other sights I'm not seeing ads on.
Also love that you can turn it on and off pretty fast. Needed to once and it wasn't confusing. 
-Great extension 10/10.
-------------------------
block
Been using this for years! It's always been reliable, effective and non-intrusive. Even blocks YT ads üôåüèæ
-------------------------
block
It used to be very good. Even after donating and paying they keeping bugging you to pay again and they want a review and constantly bug for that every time it loads on a new page.
It does a good job of blocking ads.
-------------------------
block
this extension literally every time i watch a Youtube video it blocks every ad this is amazing!üòÄ
-------------------------
block
Not blocking ads.
-------------------------
block
Overall, it's pretty good, but some websites I'm unable to block.
-------------------------
block
Best free chrome pop-up blocker

So far the most reliable app you can use to block all pop ups.
Best thing is it's absolutely free. Highly recommended. Go for it guys.
-------------------------
block
ABP is fantastic! It saved me from constantly seeing flashy images and useless ads! I hope the developers are getting their well deserved admiration for creating this product (by the way has been adding other blocking extensions - and no one worked so perfect as ABP!) At least from me they get   grateful applause! Thanks!
-------------------------
block
Great for watching things on websites like YouTube and others and block annoying ads off of websites. Still some news websites don't allow AdBlock so that's the only bad feature.
-------------------------
block
Cant live without, best add block extenwion ever
-------------------------
block
Great extension, Blocked all adds and quick in playing videos, blocks pop-ups and is very nice extension and does not take too space and blocks malware from attacking computers.
-------------------------
block
its amazing for blocking unnecessary ads on websites
-------------------------
block
THE BEST,
especially the previewing feature the show how things gonna be before blocking the element.
-------------------------
block
Definitely works! Its blocks like ROBLOX ads on the website and when your going looking at stuff like websites it really helps so you don't get viruses and scams. Best Ad Blocker. I've had it for over 1 year now :D
-------------------------
block
It was good but it won't block ads
-------------------------
block
Amazing!! I can block all those annoying add, even on Youtube
-------------------------
block
best app for blocking youtube ads
-------------------------
block
Best for blocking ads .... I loved it.
-------------------------
block
Very good at blocking the ads
-------------------------
block
It blocks every add that there is, except on aps that you can't use ad blockers, but its great
-------------------------
block
I have used this for two years at least.  Does what is says it will.  Development is consistent and frequent.  Occasionally there is a CPU hit, it gets resolved.  Very rarely there is an ad it does not catch, when reported and then blocked it usually solves this. Whitelisting sites or just pages is easy.  Thanks ABP!
-------------------------
block
it does what it says it will and it does it rather well in my opinion and at no cost to me so five star from me! 10/10 I definitely recommend though I will say while it does block ads some websites have software to see if you are using an adblocker and will stop you from using it till you deactivate the ad blocker not to criticize adblock it's free and does as promised.
-------------------------
block
Free app, runs smoothly in the background and blocks apps nearly everywhere.
-------------------------
block
blocks add most of the time
-------------------------
block
it dont always block ads ... but at least it does something
-------------------------
block
block ad good üëç
-------------------------
block
Loved it very much and block element feature is just amazaing! :D
-------------------------
block
hands down one of the best ad blockers!!!!!!!! I use typing.com to do typing lessons in one of my classes, and in the background ads refresh every few seconds. With ABP, I am able to block ads, and also block page elements. very helpful adblocker, 10/10 :D
-------------------------
block
I'm impressed by not only the reliability of ABP blocking ads everyday, but also its ability of 'blocking page elements' flawlessly, not mentioning it's totally free! What a marvel!
-------------------------
block
Its really good, Blocks every add, Except for some popups in the corner of my screen, If it blocked pop ups it would be 5/5 stars
-------------------------
block
Ads not getting blocked
-------------------------
block
Its so good at blocking ads and it's easy to use!
-------------------------
block
i love this adblocker
ive blocked around 1.5 million ads so far and this has helped tremendously when downloading files, watching content on sites, and so much more
thank you for this amazing ad blocker
-------------------------
block
Awesome website for ad blocking...
-------------------------
block
Good adblocker. Except it also blocks the honey chrome extension. If it can be fixed it's 5 star
-------------------------
block
I love this I have used it for 2 years now and have blocked 2000 ads. This is the best add blocker.
-------------------------
block
This app works great. I like the way you can turn off blocking for just one page. Sites to block are continually  updated within the app. The allow site feature get automatically populated when you turn off blocking to a particular site or page and the list is easy find in settings if you need to change or remove a site. Advanced features include the ability to create your own or import custom access or blocking filters/lists. You can even force an update to or edit the built in filters/lists
-------------------------
block
its good for blocking ads pop ups and other things
-------------------------
detect
Idea: Maybe add a feature where when websites detect an adblocker and tell you to turn it off. Maybe add a feature where those websites cant detect it? Just a suggestion, if you like it contact me at, Ultimateflexer123456@gmail.com THANKS love it btw
-------------------------
block
I've been using this app for a couple of years on my Chromebook and it is a GREAT tool for helping to reduce pesky ads on many sites. It's not that I mind having ads, but constantly having to close those that block the content, or having to scroll past several ads to see the content, becomes exasperating. I highly recommend it!
-------------------------
block
Overall, it's a good extension. It effectively blocks pop-up and youtube ads, but i wish it blocked ads on spotify better.
-------------------------
block
it's just useful and does block every annoying ad / Pop-ups !
-------------------------
block
it works very well, and blocks ads on anime sites like 9anime and stuff, but it says it blocks youtube ads, which it does not do smh. overall a really good adblocker, 10/10 would recomment
-------------------------
block
Works great. Been using it for 3 years, still no problems. Blocks YouTube ads too, so no more sitting through ads. Really effective. Wish I could rate it more than 5 stars!
-------------------------
block
Works quite well. I've used quite a few adblockers. This one is simple & effective. I like how it allows me to preview the website with the ad blocked before I actually block it. Thank you again for your helpful extension.
-------------------------
block
Good. Works perfectly, but I would like to be able to just block pop-ups or something like that.
-------------------------
block
This ABP app is great, No interuptions when i am online doing my thing etc.
And blocks out garbage that i don't need to see or read about!.
-------------------------
block
I really liked it, but what im asking for is to block pop-ups, afterall though..great work.. The fact that its free has suprised me a lot.
-------------------------
block
I love this adblocker, it blocks every single ad and I mean EVERY single ad and its so convenient and I love using it, its like gaining a passive ability for your browser but its a prestige ability. :D
-------------------------
block
Completely amazing. Not a single add since I have installed it. Especially as I go on YouTube often, I haven't had to deal with 3 adds in a row. Does not mess up my laptop at all and I would highly recommend. Its blocked over 13 thousand adds which is incredible.
-------------------------
block
It really helped me in a lot of cases plus the advanced blocking options are recommended. It sometimes crashed itself but not chrome. I recommend it.
-------------------------
block
Great app, works pretty, and blocks most ads, there might be 1 or 2 ads on a couple select websites that slip through the cracks, but overall a great service.
-------------------------
block
blocked everything from popups to yt ads! very good
-------------------------
block
It is THE BEST ad block extension available. It not only blocks all the ads and but also also pop-up ads. It works like a charm on anime and manga websites. Thank you for recomending me this extension.
-------------------------
block
This is truly the best adblock I have ever used. It has already blocked about 10,000 ads for me. It is completely free, no watermark or premium. Not like other pay to use adblocks. Devs did a great job. Thanks everyone who made this. Also, one thing, the "Adblock for Youtube‚Ñ¢" (please dont send hate to it) has a watermark. But adblock plus, best ever! Really recommend Adblock plus.
-------------------------
block
its not blocking ads itself
-------------------------
protect
Essential for a pleasant web browsing experience and one of the first extensions you should install when starting with a fresh browser, the other one which comes to mind is Crumbs which protects your privacy.
-------------------------
block
AD block is perfect it stop ALL OF THE ADS and didn't lag my computer like all of the other!!!
-------------------------
block
Best Ad Blocker ever. Blocks almost all ads
-------------------------
block
Blocks all the bad, and keeps the good running strong.
-------------------------
block
Great extension, use it for years. I especially love the ability to block the YT ads.
-------------------------
block
The best extension in chrome will be this 
Soo helpful
I am a student and in this pandemic I would always be sharing  YT videos  with students and teachers and a Baby Diaper Ad would just come and be unskippable And I would be furious 
After I found The Concept of  Adblockers I Tried A bunch but wasn't satisfied  but after i found this I love this and it always helps 
I would recommend this AdBlocker if you want to Block  some Nasty Ads
-------------------------
block
Add Blocker Plus works great. Without issue it blocks unwanted adds. Since installing it I don't see adds I don't want to see or need. Great  product at the right price.
-------------------------
block
This ad block extension amazing , it blocks all of my YouTube ads this is the highest rated ad blocker available for free on the chrome store
-------------------------
block
Simply the best addon on the store, a literal life changer. You won't appreciate how much time & sanity it saves you until logging into a public or friend's PC later on and seeing all the repulsive, dehumanizing litter that are web ads. It isn't designed to block cookies and the like so if you want to go full in on blocking those an alternative browser altogether is your best bet. As for this, it's insane that it's both this effective and this free. They never intrusively ask but you can donate to them, highly recommend. Peace of mind is priceless
-------------------------
block
Works really well.  I only wish the 'block element' feature worked better when trying to view news articles that show the 'disable ad blocker' overlay.
-------------------------
block
I absolutely love this product. If something isn't blocked, you can use Adblock Plus to block elements on a per page basis. I think this makes the software incredibly powerful. Most of the time it just works out of the box. I would recommend this product many times over!
-------------------------
block
Good stuff can block utube ads
-------------------------
block
Awesome extension that cut down on a lot of unnecessary ads... can also choose to have ads or no ads at all by turning off the ad blocker and refreshing the page. Saved me from lots of ugly ads blocking the page. Highly highly recommend! Works great on chrome, might slow down some processes a little (not tested but highly suspect) but overall good for daily usage.
-------------------------
block
This is a wonderful "must have" extension for blocking unnecessary ads!
-------------------------
protect
Love! Your app protected me from so many trash ADS. Thank you.
-------------------------
block
It just blocks ads.  It's really helpful.
-------------------------
block
Superb! Blocking distracting ads helps me to stay focused. My productivity has improved.
-------------------------
block
Great browser extension, extremely easy to set up upon first use using the settings that are web-based basically on a web page and to configure everything on the first run - thankfully when I bought a used Google Chromebook from Acer, once I sign into Gmail slash Google, Adblock Plus was pulled in from my I guess Windows 10 desktop PC and other places I was happy to not have to go download this again. It's a little confusing that there's an ad block I guess basic, and Adblock Plus, and I think there's an Adblock Pro which is maybe a subscription or annual payment model - hopefully this is not the freemium model or bait and switch Etc. Very pleased with configuring settings and letting be browser extension hideout in the background nice and quietly. Kudos 5 of 5 stars!
-------------------------
block
Ad Block Plus is the very best for blocking ads, preventing thrd party tracking and so many other options, I t has never disappointed me.
-------------------------
block
good, but it does not block google tag manager
-------------------------
block
Some streaming sites use multiple redirects on one link. Adblock+ used to deal with these but now does not and I dont know how to prevent this happening by using the "Block element" feature in case doing this prevents the link from working. Otherwise excellent!
-------------------------
block
I'm afraid it doesn't block YouTube ads!
-------------------------
block
Have always used Adblock on all my devices and have never had any issues with it. It is so easy to use and is free so what's not to love? This is always the first extension I ad to my new computers. Plus I always recommend it to friends due to it being such a reliable ad blocking service. I personally have never had any issues with it slowing down my pc in any way.
-------------------------
block
AMAZING. Blocks all ads if you turn off allow acceptable ads and... finally.. what I've been looking for.
-------------------------
block
I have been happy with Ad Block and especially like the whitelist feature.
-------------------------
block
best blocking extension
-------------------------
block
It works great, especially blocking particular contents of websites.
-------------------------
block
I've been using adblock plus since 2014 and they've been awesome. Only a few months in between 2014 to now has adblock plus not block intrusive ads. Mostly around election season. But for the most part, adblock plus is a 10/10!
-------------------------
block
BEST THING EVER! THIS WILL LITERALLY SAVE YOUR LIFE. I have used this for 2 ish years and it blocks EVERY. ADD. IN. EXISTENCE. not just youtube, but while your watching movies, and every website, like if your playing games, etc. Its completely safe, and for me it doesn't up that much space, it  is literally the best thing in the world!!!
-------------------------
block
This is a very good Adblocker that I came across. Blocks almost every annoying ad. I can watch Youtube without any full screen ads. Love it!
-------------------------
block
its actually surprisingly pretty good at blocking sudden pop ups especially if you're streaming vids.
-------------------------
block
It blocked Yotube ads and an all sites! I definitely recommend it!
-------------------------
block
Amazing! Blocks ads for youtube, roblox and more.
-------------------------
prevent
Very good ad blocker. It works on so many sites such as YouTube, Crunchyroll, Funimation, and more. This is also good for virus prevention, especially if using a free movie or show website. Very customizable and still being updated. Thank you Adblock Plus!
-------------------------
block
This adblocker is AMAZING! it blocks pretty much every ad and if one slips thru you always have the "block element tool" so get rid of unwanted ads and other things. 5/5 keep up the good work devs
-------------------------
block
blocks all ads perfectly
-------------------------
block
The best one it blocks everything i love it. i use it for anime
-------------------------
block
Excellent blocking- effortless for me to use. Thanx so much!!! :)
-------------------------
block
very good but doesn't seem to block youtube ads anymore
-------------------------
block
I like adblock plus - it blocks most ads from most sites most of the times, rarely crashes or glitches, and I know they do update it relatively often. Might try the mobile version soon. I would be glad to see Adblock Plus claim their Trustpilot Review Profile as I know that that's something I look to when I'm downloading new software/extensions/etc. Some people have suggested that the extension mines cryptocurrency in the background on your computer or adds its own malware, but I certainly haven't come across anything that would indicate that. I like the fact that I can whitelist pages - unfortunately, there are many websites that do not allow you to browse without enabling ads, but on the most part it's fine - it would be useful to have a temporary whitelist, so you can browse a page but it's not stored as whitelisted unless you go for a permanent whitelist type thing. Overall, I feel that Adblock Plus does a good job and doesn't cause me issues, and I know it's been recommended widely by some of the privacy/tech blogs I go on to in the past. However, having seen the trustpilot page and some of the other reviews here, I think I will do a bit more research now to check it's still the best option for me.

bypass
I have a couple of macbook pros.
i learned not to do updates for safari, because it removed my adblock plus and i could never use it again... i have mojave on one, am not going to update it, and adblock plus is like God to me, living for two years with ads on youtube, now ad free completely...
i find every couple of weeks youtube or google comes out with a new bypass probably a trojan on a video i watch, but i found a way to stop all ads...
all you do is open the adblock plus icon on top of your screen, on CHROME, which I am using, NOT safari, it wont work on safari anymore... but on Chrome, when you install adblock plus, you get a red icon on top of screen. Click on the gear and open settings then on left go to Advanced, and then update your filter lists and you will stop all youtube ads...
ADBLOCK PLUS, i love you, saving me data way out in the bush using my phone... thank you guys you are tops...
-------------------------
block
been using this extension for only a around half a year but its the best I've had, blocks everything on every website, all for free. Couldn't ask for more :)
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block ads on Twitch
-------------------------
block
Been surfing the web for awhile and had bad experiences with other adblockers, until I finally got this one. blocks everything and if there's a script that bypasses it they have a feature where you can block the element manually and you won't ever see it. I highly recommend this to anyone with a computer and wants a sense of peace when it comes to doing their work or just want to surf the web
-------------------------
block
This Is The Best Ads Blocker Unlike Other Ad Blockers Who Block Ad After Its Come On YT Its Block Ad Before Its Come Because Of Other Ad Blockers Block After Ad Comes The Video Reload And Other Ad Blocker Doesn't Block YT Ad Until Its Road And Because Of That Feature Of ABP Its Not Wasting My Internet, Thanks Team ABP
-------------------------
block
Quick and easy to install. Blocked well over 160,000 adverts in total so far. Extremely good.
-------------------------
block
it was brilliant, i really recommend this to everyone. its perfect you can use the "block element" button to black ANYTHING you want on a page, its simply marvelous and it reduces lag on websites. overall i give it a 10/10
-------------------------
block
A must have extension in all the browsers, cool feature is that it can block all types of ads, especially youtube's.
-------------------------
block
Need a break from intrusive ads that keep harassing you no matter what you do? this extension made my live come back like a angel blessed me. You should probably donate them some money for the things they're doing to make it easier to focus without advertisements, it can be glitchy sometimes and may not be able to block specific ads like normal ones you see that are just a picture and some dialogue, give it a try.
-------------------------
block
It's nice, but it doesn't block all adds on reddit. Fix this and I'll go up to 5 stars!
-------------------------
block
Downloaded it 5 minutes ago, and it has already blocked 20 ads. My web browsing has never been cleaner. Thank you so much!

Gosh,this extension rocks.It does block the adds that bug me.
-------------------------

I love it and i think all you need to do is make it so you can disable it when the is nothoong to block and I think you need themes they look good to
-------------------------
block
this is an amazing app it does what it says it does it blocks ads every where i was mainly using it for youtube and it worked
-------------------------
block
This is hands down the best ad block extension
-------------------------
block
What a great extension. This help me by blocking ads. wether you open youtube song, or video tutorial or review product, you can enjoy it without subscribe to premieum. I hope this tool available in Android tv. Thank you.

Amazing! Should make a desktop application that blocks it EVERYWHERE. :)

The best Ad Block program, this will block all ads on facebook, it works on all websites, i been using this program for 3 years, and i also install this on all my clients computers. Everyone seems to love it and always ask me how did you remove those ads this is great. Install this and be free from Ads
-------------------------
block
very efficient, good when im at school so i don't get questionable ads (you know what i am referring to). the name might sound misleading, like you need to pay for it because it says adblock plus. but it is completely free. only issue is sometimes when i try to block elements on a website it doesn't work properly and i have to do it manually by copying the file name. but other than that it is very good. sorry for the paragraph.
-------------------------
block
Does not block pop ups

The Best Add Block on this Planet.

Absolutely amazing!  ‚ú® I've never had any problems with it.  I love how I can decide which sites I block ads on.  I use it on every single Google account of mine.  I definitely recommend downloading this! üíó
-------------------------
block
Awesome extension! I use it mainly on YouTube and it blocks all the ads in it. So good
-------------------------
block
Great! I love how you can block specific elements on the page as well. 
Amazing!
-------------------------

This adblocker has been very helpful, and its one of the only working adblockers that I've found, one thing though, it doesn't block ads on all sites, I've found a few of them that still play ads, but still, this is a great adblocker and I'd definitely recommend it
-------------------------
block
This is one of the best Adblocker and Pop-up blocker in the chrome store. My school used it for 3 years and i have used it for 4 years. Eventually my school stopped it because they blocked the chrome web store lmao. But either way, this is one of the best adblocker! I am very satisfied with this.
-------------------------
block
Adblock works well if you can use the whitelist and allow your websites that you want to not block you come through undisturbed.
-------------------------
block
it doesnt block all sites :)
-------------------------
block
Such a great, simple tool. Makes it super easy to not block ads on specific pages as well.
-------------------------
protect
I've used Adblock Plus for several years, and it is easily the most helpful addon that I have ever installed. This addon halts third party tracking, protects my privacy, and removes frustrating adds all in one notion. I would recommend this app to any internet user. Great addon, never had issues :) !
-------------------------
block
The easiest and smartest tool I have ever experienced on add blocking.
-------------------------
block
It is the perfect adblocker!!! All the other adblockers I used either did not block youtube ads or cost money. This is perfect and free.
-------------------------
block
Very good. Can block ads on all sites. I have been using it for almost 6 months and I have had no problems.
-------------------------
block
Very helpful and not at all annoying. Recommend to a lot of people who are annoyed with ads blocking view and being confusing. I also like that I can still see some if I want to that I like. I love that it's free too and that google allows it for a lot of dumb websites instead of having to tediously tell each website them self to cut down on the amount of ads they show. It also helps my computer run things faster and I can have enough tabs open for my work. Super good.
-------------------------
block
it has been working well so far. much better than adblocker which did NOT block any ad.
-------------------------
block
OMG! So many tracker blocked!! Love this extension!!
-------------------------
block
I have been using this service for years now, close to five years I believe. I am more than satisfied with it, and have been since I began using it years ago. If you are looking for a quality ad blocking service, I would highly recommend using this one!
This has gone above and beyond my expectations. I originally starting using it to just block ads when doing schoolwork, but now I rarely turn it off.
-------------------------
block
this thing even blocks viruses. wow
-------------------------
block
I had been having problems with this app not blocking anything, then I saw someones comments about going into settings and choosing your preferences.  I did not realise there was settings, silly me. I now have a perfect blocking system so thank you very much.
-------------------------
block
I like it because it blocks youtube ads which is nice because those are SOOOOOO annoying but i rate it 4 star because its a bit glitchy and it blocked my friends chat with me and i made a new one and it did it again i would rate it 3 star how much work i had to do but i'm a nice guy and i rated it 4 star
-------------------------
block
i love this its free and it blocks annoying ads
-------------------------
block
Blocks all ads, good setting configurations. Best, it's free!
-------------------------
block
Its the best free ad blocker. It blocks every single ad and also tells me how many ads I have blocked.
-------------------------
block
it's working pretty good and I want to suggest that there should be one more feature for kids like parental control to block adult content on the internet than there will not be any need to download another extension or software for both things
-------------------------
block
I absolutely love it. While yes some website force you to disable it, on websites that let you continue even with it on makes my experience better on said websites. This extension makes my experience on chrome much better because it blocks most ads that I normally would encounter. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an adblocker.
-------------------------
block
It doesn`t block google! Maybe this score is for Google...
-------------------------
block
Simply, THE BEST add block
-------------------------
block
Best chrome extension ever! It blocks those annoying ads in youtube and this definitely smoothen my experience in it. 

Again, many thanks to the developer, much appreciate to your effort.
-------------------------
block
very good love it blocks all ads
-------------------------
block
Works really well. I love the option for allowing acceptable ads, so that I can still help out websites I want to support.

It would be nice to have a function to be able to block redirects, pop ups, and anti adblock detectors.
-------------------------
block
very good. blocks all ads on every website so far as i can see
-------------------------
block
It is the best ad blocker for me. It blocks ads in the games I play. It is the best ad blocker I have ever used.
-------------------------
block
100% worth it. It's awesome. I just got it yesterday and I it already blocked over 1,500 items. My gaming has been much faster since I installed this. and now I feel a bit safer. Thank you to the developers of this and keep up the good work. I'd recommend this to anybody.
-------------------------
block
I have used this extension for 7 years now and have loved it. Some sites are getting "smart" and try to block the ad blocker. I just move on to a new site that won't force a million clickbait ads on me. The best Chrome extension I have ever used.
-------------------------
block
I love this thing, had it for a long time, it has never failed me, on my other account has blocked over 20k ads, this account has blocked right around 20k ads, love it totally recommend.
-------------------------
block
finally, i can enjoy videos without having boring ads on them and can watch anime without getting bombarded by ads and it has already blocked over 1k ads in less than a week
-------------------------
block
Realy like the fact that we can add the site so there is no doubt about blocking or not certain site.
-------------------------
block
It worked for a while, but i started seeing ads again, i will change the review when fixed. But before it blocked ads really well and 100% recommend
-------------------------
block
EPIC! BLOCKS ALL THE ADS!!!!! LOVE IT!!
-------------------------
block
it is the best free ad blocker and it actually blocks ads
-------------------------
block
It does exactly what it says it does. I immediately tested it after installation, the first thing I notice is all the ads are gone. I also noticed it blocked MORE that I wanted. It works perfectly, but I saw some outlines of where ads are supposed to be. It is a good extension, I just think it could use a few small improvements..
-------------------------
block
Loved it. Blocked everything I wanted, better than other competitors I tried. I trust this. Recommend.
-------------------------
block
Have used this AD Blocking software for years!!!  Works wonderfully, I have never had a problem with it and highly recommend!
-------------------------

the best ad blocker it blocks every ads.
-------------------------

very nice extension and does exactly what I need it to do... block those annoying ads!  Thanks for a great product!
-------------------------

Working very well.Better than all the other adblockers. Easy usage. Can be switched on and off easily. Completely blocks ads even from Youtube. Very useful.
-------------------------
block
Works great! Blocks video ads on windows, chrome os, mac, and much more! Blocks video ads too!
-------------------------
block
great it even blocks on youtube
-------------------------
block
this is the best ad blocker ƒ± have ever seen in my life I think that this is the best ad blocker that I could find for chrome. It blocks any ad from any website, including YouTube, that does not have the images embedded into the page. Everything runs so much better and it does not take up any space. There are still those websites that make you disable ad blockers, but that is the only think that could get around it. Overall, this is a great extension to chrome. I would highly recommend this to everyone!
-------------------------
block
Does its job well. To make sure your blocking out all Ads go to settings and make sure "Allow Acceptable Ads" is off.
-------------------------
block
It really works! I love it so much! Blocks adds on Youtube, amazon, and more!
-------------------------
block
Used to work fantastic, until TODAY, whereby it began to block pages loading altogether, I removed it and voila everything loads fine now. It happened on MS Edge too.
-------------------------
block
i really wish it blocked ads on twitch but great overall adblocker!
-------------------------
block
This is a really good ad blocker and i recommend it. I find it very helpful that you can create your own ad block filters. Thanks to the people who made this, you can see that they put time and effort into this! Thank you so muchüòä
-------------------------

I am loving it so far. Blocking all pop-ups, redirection, etc.

I thought it was time to say thank you by writing this review.  Since I've been using Adblock Plus I've come to take for granted that there are no advertisements.  It's literally amazing and I love it.  I can't believe this is free.  I use it on my phone with the same result.  When I first downloaded it I would sometimes get the random ad, but thankfully with the "block this element" feature I almost never see ads anymore.  I don't know how I could ever go back to surfing without it.  I hope this review helps the creators in some way because I truly am grateful.
-------------------------
block
I appreciate offering the middle ground between blocking obtrusive ads and allowing ads for people you wanna support.
-------------------------
block
This is a solid program to block pesky mosquitoes I mean - ads! Thanks

An excellent Chrome extension that allows you to easily block ads. It is customizable and convenient.

The feature works behind the scenes protecting from excessive ads on some web sites. It is non-obtrusive and effective.

Truly amazing! Free, customizable, allows for individual element blocking, and works. This extension makes the web a saner place.

wonderful best ad block on Earth.
-------------------------
block
Adblock plus, on default settings, only blocks "annoying ads'" numbnuts. use ur brain, go into adblock plus settings and press "Only allow ads without third-party tracking." Now u should have no more problems. Like geez people. Try doing something urself this time and not expecting some simple program to solve all of your problems. It's just a couple of ads' on youtube, you'll live.
-------------------------
block
Excellent app. It blocks advertisement
-------------------------
block
Download this and it blocks most of the ads on Hulu if you're watching it on a browser. You're welcome.
-------------------------
prevent
This ad blocker is working very well for me. I have no complaints and it does just what I want it to do; prevent a tsunami of penile enhancements from coming my way. (Not really, more like computer enhancements.)
-------------------------
block
It work perfect for me, it block many ads I don't want to see and it is free.
-------------------------
prevent
Things got to the point where I could barely use my laptop. If I wanted to research something, it was quite painful with intrusive adds, screen refreshers, auto-play video vlips, terrible slow-downs to load the 30 rotating adds on either side of article I want to read. This prevented me from doing anything meaningful on the internet. Ad-Block Plus gave me back the internet. It is easy to use and once you set it up the way you want, there is very little maintenance. I have found news agencies are the quickest sites to slam notifications on your screen telling you to remove your ad-blocker, but I just go to a site that doesn't do that instead of adding them to the exclusions list. Ad-block Plus is a beautiful thing and makes the internet usable again! I have been using it for a couple years now and have added it to my phone and home pc as well.

BEST EXTENSION EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BLOCKS ALL ADS AND TRACKERS ALL FOR 0.00$!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GREAT PRODUCT!

Amazing adblocker which meets all my needs. The UI on the settings menu is easy to use and look at, unlike adblockers I've used in the past. Needs popup blocking though
-------------------------

amazing, it blocked all youtube ads and i have never seen an ad again

this is real

wow this is amazing no adds are popping up at all! Not even ads in roblox are popping up. Best ad block i have ever gotten

This does not block ads. I still get continual ads on my computer. If you actually want a browser that works, download Opera browser and it comes with an ad blocker built into the browser in incognito and in regular tabs... an it actually works. Don't waste your time with this product.
-------------------------
block
Works very well! I especially like that you can block individual elements that it occasionally doesn't catch.
-------------------------

IT'S BRILLIANT, i searched for ad blocking extensions before and non of them worked properly. Then a friend told me to try Ad Block Plus, i found it in the extensions section, installed it, and iv'e not looked back since. Now whenever i go on a website and the notice comes up to disable my Ad Blocker i cant help but smile. Thankyou  for being an IT Friend.
-------------------------
block
I really like this. Easy adblocker to use, easy to add custom filters, easy to turn on and off. I'm sure there are more sophisticated adblockers out there (adblock plus does have a tendency to block hyperlinks that try to open the link in a new window or tab) but this does everything I need it to do.
-------------------------
block
It just works.

Used it for 2 years. Has never gotten in the way. Only does good things. There have only been a small number of websites that it hasn't blocked ads on, how ever the results are the same as a good DNS sinkhole config. The plugin is as good as it gets for client side ad-blocking.
-------------------------
block
really good.good quality..it makes me happy... one of my best ad block..proudly saying...thanks as block team...
-------------------------
block
It blocks the ads without a problem and is not intrusive.
-------------------------
block
Good alternative for many other ad blocking options available.
-------------------------
block
I have blocked over a million ads with this extension, ad block is the most trustworthy and best extension ever.
-------------------------
block
I use both this and "AdBlock" (which seems to be a different company, but is also free) simultaneously. They block a very different number of ads, but I don't know if that is because one gets to them first before the other, and then the ad isn't there to block anymore, or if they have different parameters for what constitutes an ad. Either way, between the two, I am very very happy. 

I ultimately had to disable ALL ads, since the very purpose for which I even installed these blockers was to keep my poor computer from overheating, which was happening all the time with the constant video ads playing. When I initially allowed "safe" ads (or whatever they called it) to stay, my computer was still being overworked. But ever since I turned off all ads (which I feel badly about, but WHY DO ALL ADS these days have to be freaking videos?!?!), my computer hasn't overheated once! üòÉ

My only suggestion/complaint (?) would be that these work a little bit more discreetly. I have had a lot of pages stop me on a landing page before entering to ask if I would please turn off my ad blocker. I wish they just didn't know about them! Not sure if this is a possibility, or not. 

Anyway, I am extremely pleased and grateful for this service, and I highly recommend this and AdBlock together.

This app not block some google ads
-------------------------

Just pure awesome. reccomended if you hate ads that pop up on your screen. its trustworthy, and AWESOME. if there was 100 stars, ill give it 100/100. It exceeds its job by blocking other things that are not ads like social media watching etc.. This is the best adblock, you should try it!!!!!!!!!!
-------------------------
block
ad block plus really works, it's blocking like 18 for every website
-------------------------
block
This Ad blocker is amazing. Ad Block Plus has a couple of options in the settings to customize web page experience. Or you can just use the default setting, which works great for blocking unwanted and sometimes even harmful ads. I highly recommended.
-------------------------

very good and blocks the adds properly
-------------------------
block
This is a really helpful extension that blocks unwanted and harmful ads from view! I LOVE IT!

I find this very useful.  It is quite capable, function rich and educates the user with each item or option selected.  There is so much that this application covers -- far more than I ever thought existed -- and the in depth protections are definitely comforting...

If you browse the web in any way you need to protect yourself, using AdBlock s a great first step.

I would love if there was an option to only block video ads, but otherwise it does everything perfectly
-------------------------

The Thing is, when i installed this i was skeptical about how it worked ant stuff, but after using this in many sites, it works PERFECTLY, i only needed a Adblock to block Popup ads so the scenario may depend, but this works like a charm if you need one for popup ads.

BEST FOR AD BLOCK
I LIKE IT

It is the best! It blocks every ad, lets you control the extension, and doesn't give your device any viruses! Thanks Google :)
-------------------------

Worked good, keyword, worked*. Now it doesn't filter out pretty much anything i try to manually block. Auto play videos pop up, ads that sneak through are unable to be blocked. Might want to step up the game to keep the pace with the scumbag ad agencies...
-------------------------
protect
All you have to do is set it and forget it. You can read articles uninterrupted, your content loads much faster, it protects you from false links/scamming/spamming/phishing/ID theft, this FREE app does so much.

Great for blocking unwanted popups and sometimes works on streaming.

Ever since I have had Ad Block, it has been excellent having not to deal with popups while working  on my school project.
-------------------------
block
I have had this for many years, it has served me well by blocking over 25000 ads.
-------------------------
block
This is by far the best ad blocker out there. Its simpler and easier to use than the other ones. While it doesn't block EVERY SINGLE AD on some pages it still offers a feature where you can manually block the element (blocking it from the code itself) so that any code like that in the elements tab wont show up on the page when you reload it. I would give 4 stars if it didn't have that feature. Overall though, Ad Blocker Plus works VERY WELL and makes load times faster than Firefox.
-------------------------
prevent
I don't honestly like watching ads, and as a pretty young adult, I don't really care about that stuff and I couldn't go anywhere without running into virus inducing ads. So that's why I got adblock, it prevents any and all ads from showing up, it's fantastic! Don't like nightmare inducing commercials or 3 minute ads about a terrible movies? Adblock Plus! This is recommended for any web surfing loser like myself, take care, everyone, have a wonderful day.

Reliable and fuss-free. Love the ability to toggle the extension for certain websites and target specific ads with a right-click. I use it almost all the time to block out potential security threats or just to speed up loading. I definitely recommend this over any other ad blocking extensions.

Not sure if you've found a replacement by now, but my recommendation has always been ublock origin (make sure it has origin in its name). It's simply the best blocker out there, hands down. Never experienced a single issue, not once, and it blocks absolutely everything. While at the same time giving you total control of exactly what, when, & where to block, if you choose to do so (optional, it works fine default). It's also the lightest on resources, speeding everything up instead of bogging it down. You can also add/enable/check additional filter lists in its settings. There's even one (or a few) that gets rid of all those annoying "disable adblocker" messages you were referring to.
-------------------------
block
Love it, Easy to use, Block all ads!
-------------------------
block
Hands down, this is currently the best adblocking extension. It literally blocks every ad possible. I saw many people complaining about Google ads, what they need to is visit the settings page ones and disable the options for those. After doing that make sure to update your lists. It'll work perfectly fine.

I really love Adblock Plus!

It automatically blocks almost every advertisement, even the annoying popup ones on YT videos. It also makes pages load a lot faster on my outdated computer which is a huge plus.

One feature that I really like is being able to whitelist individual websites so AB+ won't block their ads. That gives me the ability to support websites that I like by allowing them to earn a little ad revenue from me. It also makes me feel like I have a lot more control over my privacy.
-------------------------

I love this! Adblocker Plus not only blocks those aggravating advertisements that interrupt your day, but also helps keep me away from those tracking sites. It's really great, and I'd recommend it to anyone who asks. 10/10!

It does it's job and does it well. I do have some issues with sites which will block access if this is on, but that isn't an issue that can be fixed by this extension. And while it does miss a few ads every once in a while, it has been reliable and makes browsing the Internet much better.

This ad blocker works great! There are the occasional times it lets an ad get through, but this is rare. The best part of this is that it REALLY DOES BLOCK PANDORA/SPOTIFY ADS! I used to hate Spotify because there were SO many ads, but now there are none, so I love it! Thanks, Adblock!
-------------------------

It's great because it blocks the annoying ads on Pandora and YouTube which is very useful

ebay has been very slow for me lately, i was watching all these ad-server url's in the progress box, so i installed this app, Adblock Plus, left on default settings and now it blocks 18 elements on every ebay page refresh and it's MUCH faster loading the content ... THIS IS A GREAT APP !

Best Ad Block Extension for chrome..

great tool to prevent Youtubers to earn money for doing nothing

I love this extension it blocks all of the ads and I've never seen an add since I've downloaded this.
-------------------------
prevent
Adblock Plus helped me to prevent the abnormal spike (over 90%) in CPUs core temperatures that occurred upon visiting websites containing poorly coded, CPU-hogging Flash-content, be they ads or non-ads. In addition, Adblock Plus helped with taking out all the notoriously obtrusive, non-Flash Ads in some of the news-websites which offer useful content, but are bad at keeping users' interests above their clueless Ad-Sales Team's interests and their Advertisers' interests.

Moreover, allowing users to whitelist content (ads or non-ads) is the most useful feature. It may require a learning-curve for many folks, but if one can figure out the way to manage that, it offers increased value.

I highly recommend Adblock Plus to every one who desires a rewarding user-experience while making meaningful use of the Web.

Thank you Team EyeO for this great work. May the Force be with you!

I have used Adblock for a while and it worked perfectly until yesterday I downloaded a freeware. All ads came back. I tried removing malware and nothing could help. So I tried uninstalling Adblock and then install Adblock Plus, it worked to my surprise.  I guess there was a malware/adware embedded in the freeware that I downloaded which bypassed the Adblock, and luckily Adblock Plus is not affected. Thanks to the software team.

DOES NOT STEAL BANK DETAILS.

I have been using this extension for years, and only when switching to another due to lack of a single feature was my BANK LOGIN INFORMATION stolen!! (FROM ANOTHER REPUTABLE AD BLOCKER).

Though only fulfilling 99% of my ad blocking needs, I trust this publisher 100% for SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. I personally recommend this ad blocker over all others.

I love this app. It is absolutely amazing. Some websites have begun to block ABP users or mandate the user to "whitelist" their website. I don't. I bounce and move to the next. There are other ways to monetize your efforts besides pasting advertisements all over your website...

I got to know this app when  I was searching for a solution to remove the ads from YouTube and after installing it, it works seamlessly and does not show a single ad in the video or on the suggestions list.

Hey Aiseruchan, do you mean our acceptable ads program? We don't believe that blocking all ads is a sustainable solution for the free web. But if you don't like any ads then you're more than welcome to turn off the option!

1/23/17 does not block video ads on youtube
-------------------------

5* Review I use it for convenience. I have yet to ever encounter a problem. There may be those dodgy ads now and then, but I haven't noticed slowing from it. I personally believe those ads don't get blocked because they're more apart of the site itself, not just an ad on the side. In my opinion, the extension does what you want it to.
-------------------------
block
wow..It really works..Thanks it block all the Ads.This is much needed extension..
-------------------------
block
While quite a few ads get through anyway, it does get rid of a number of the most annoying. The thing I'm most mad about is that youtube ads have started getting through, something that adblock plus states by name as something it successfully blocks.

Positive.
1.) size 1.4 mb only
2.) Easy To Navigate
3.) Block Most ads But not All.

Final 
I appreciate this extension developers. Because ad Creaters
Finding the way of bypass adblock plus extension. so adblock plus team also need to find their new ways. I mean daily update need. 

Anyway i am not a computer scientist. I am common man, so in my POINT OF VIEW this is best extension.
-------------------------
block
WOW I can't believe this works so well.  Websites are now readable!  Now if we could update this app to make websites THINK they showed the ad's when they did not.  A few websites are detecting adblock software is installed and now nagging about it.  Block the ads, make the sites think were not blocking the ads, and all will be well.

I've always been a fan since extensions became a thing. People are upset about the acceptable ads, but you can easily disable them in the settings, and even then, at least the ads are clean. I love Eyeo for fighting for our right to block ads!

there were awesome at the beginning but now company are paying them money so they don't block ads.

Honestly I just can NOT live without this. This is the BEST and easiest Ad Blocking tool out there. I admit I'm technologically challenged and I get stressed out when I have to deal with a lot of apps or extensions..you have to spend days figuring out the terminology and a vast amount of technical data NOT Adblock Plus just set it and forget it LMAO Fantastic easy to use and effective

I've had a short experience with Adblock Plus, and I already love it! It does its job very well. Yes, I will excuse some ads that still show up, as I know it's impossible to block EVERY SINGLE AD! I still like it, though.

Really great for blocking ads. These days ads are really annoying. This extension really helps.

Pop-ups didn't get blocked anyway.

Have only had this extension a little while, and have only experienced it on You Tube so far, but even if it didn't work as well on other sites (don't know yet), it's worth it just for the ads blocked on You Tube. Wonderful.

Works just like its meant  to. Awesome blocker. Still needs work on blocking redirecting ads but I  think they get on it soon
-------------------------
block
This is a great plugin. I am guessing all the 1-star reviews are from morons, or people hired by a competing product.  I love Adblock Plus.  Over 10 million users does not scream 1-star product to me.  I accidentally installed AdBlock on one of my computers instead of Adblock Plus and was shocked at how many ads it failed to block.  Installed Adblock Plus instead and POOF, back to normal.  I have given multiple donations to the developer.  I appreciate that you have the option of getting down into the base level of being able to write your own filters if you need to.

Hey guys, if you want to block ads even if they paid to be let through, click on your extension, go to the bottom saying Options at the bottom of the GUI, and customize it there. Over all, this blocked ALL the annoying ads. Don't accuse me of being a bot. I know some things are bad about this ad blocker, but I liked it. It worked great. Possibly the best ad blocker on google anyway.

ABP has an option for its users to accept curated non-intrusive advertising. That is the only kind I would ever consider accepting. ABP offers the option to opt out of that curation, and to block all ads at its maximum strength. It's there, sir; what you do now is up to you.

With ABP, you get no more annoying ads. No ads on YouTube videos, websites articles, adf.ly, and if there is a specific ad or image that remains, you can manually block it. ABP is pretty great!

-------------------------
block
Easy to use.  It is great for blocking ads, especially ads that appear to be tech support and error messages.  Also helps large pages with huge numbers of ads load faster.  (I do sympathize with companies who provide news or tools for free, and I do disable Ad Blocker on those websites, for example newspaper websites, provided the ads are not excessive or confusing.  That is easy to do, just click on the ABP stopsign and deselect "Enabled on this site".)  To sum up, I've used ABP for years and I highly recommend it.

It's fantastic! Especially for the increasing number of adverts on YouTube and other such spammy sites.
HOWEVER it does, by default block all images on google photos, but that's Ok because you can disable the blocker for such situations.
You can also disable the blocker for sites you wish to support, like charities and freeware sites.
Keep up the good job!

I had to give it a 3 because it was causing such a delay in my apps opening up. Also, the best thing about this extension is that it did block ads.  Although sometimes an ad would sneak through!  But for those who don't mind waiting so long for your app to open up, this is the best.

Great! I would give it 5 stars, but recently I have been seeing banners on some sites that, even when I use the Block Element feature to block them (it allows you to force an ad or banner to be removed by adding it or it's location on the page specifically to the block list), they pop back up instantly. What is unusual is that when they pop back up (when I have not reloaded or refreshed the web page yet) they show up in a different location on the page (the top left area) until I refresh the page and then they are back to where they were originally and unchanged.

One of the best extensions ever. Some ads may still pop up, but thanks to Adblock Plus, most are kept at bay, especially the spammy ones on social networking sites such as facebook. It also helps to improve the performance of your browser when playing games, as a lot of the ads that it blocks would have been using the same plug-in which games on the browser use, thus slowing down the game's functions. With this extension, your web games performance will be enhanced.

I have been using this version of Adblock for a couple of years now.  Ninety-nine percent of the time I absolutely love it.  

The only time I have an issue with it is when I am trying to watch something on one of the major network sites, such as CBS, and the ads are no longer being blocked.  I find I need to go look and see what new filter syntax might be needed because CBS (or other site) keeps catching on and changing things.  I would hope that any new filter would be included with the updated lists but it never seems to.

Other than that little bump, I love this extension so much that I tell everyone I come in contact with all about it if they don't already know.

Brilliant ad blocker, also blocks annoying content on Facebook and Malware!  Got bored of Ad block pro stopping working and having to uninstall and reinstall so far so good Thanks :D
-------------------------
block
dose not block all adds
-------------------------
block
Love the new changes, letting through proper ads if you want, and blocking dangerous and annoying ones. All it needs is YouTube, Twitch, Hitbox, and Wikipedia whitelisted by default and it'll be flawless! ^_^
-------------------------
block
good to block the adds
-------------------------
block
Others block more ads but Adblock Plus is the least intrusive.   It works flawlessly all the time.
-------------------------
block
extremely good at blocking pop up and embedded (in-page) adds. Also allows you to add a white list and blocker lists update frequently.
-------------------------
block
its very good to block the adds
-------------------------
bypass
It was the BEST.. Until recently when ads started bypassing.. Nevertheless it is still good.
-------------------------
block
I have used this for the longest time, works great and troubleshooting support is good.

If Adblock Plus is not blocking ads on Chrome please click on the Support tab of the addon window and click the "support site" link.
-------------------------
block
Can't block all, but it's the best I've seen still.
-------------------------
block
Best ads blocker ever! If it doesn't block enough ads, you can choose "block element". Rate this for 99999999999999999999999

Nothing is getting blocked in GMail!

Not only it saved my lot of time and resources but also helped me focus on what I want to do. It has drastically improved my interaction over Internet. Now I enjoy far better than ever. This is the first time I have realised the power of Ad Blocking. Thank You so much.
-------------------------
block
LOL where has this app been all my computer life!!!!! It blocks everything!!! Even youtube ads!!! This is the best app I have used maybe ever in terms of usefulness.
-------------------------
block
Good, but now doesn't block youtube ads.
-------------------------
block
It blocks 90% of adds but sometimes I don't know maybe there are too much adds on a page but it doesn't work at all or very bad . but still one of the best extensions in this category ;)
-------------------------
block
it doesnt block ads on youtube. or facebook. or really anywhere that i need it to block ads from.

i am on windows 10, in a relatively powerful gaming rig.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block youtube

worked awesome until today! now it isnt blocking anything! :(
-------------------------
block
It's ok. Don't like having to use Block lists so will try another.
-------------------------
block
Its a fantastic app for blocking add and malware

Really good Protection for Ads to disable i recommend this app.

block
I just Love It! It Blocks every Ad! Thank You!

block
nice app!  Does exactly what I need it to -- block ads!
-------------------------
block
Love it ... it do awesome job at blocking add.
-------------------------
block
This is awesome! You should totaly get this! It blocks adds on websites,youtube ads,and is very customizable!
-------------------------
block
Awesome.. will give 5 stars if it allows to block surveys
-------------------------
block
I love this app! It does what it needs to do. I use Google Chrome as my only web browser if at all possibl and it blocks alla ads except some huluplus video ads and all YouTube video ads. I got a YouTube ad block and that worked perfectly, except it used the transparent video player instead of the regular YouTube player, which annoys me.
-------------------------
protect
Nice protection
-------------------------
block
Sold. Does not block ads (the one who payed the developer).
-------------------------
block
great app to block those irritating pop up ads
-------------------------
block
Ad Block plus is the best download ever. It blocks all ads no questions and the only thank you they ask is a donation to help support them. Thank you Adblock Plus I love you and support you all the way
-------------------------
block
Adblock plus is the best for blocking those pesky advertisements!
-------------------------
block
nice app to block adds
-------------------------
block
Wow amazing ad block extension
-------------------------
block
I'm very satisfied with this ad blocker. It also supports websites by only blocking the intrusive ads.
-------------------------
block
I really liked using ad block plus. However, there is only one catch with it if it can be fixed which is that sometimes it stops working on sites. Otherwise the plugin is awesome.
-------------------------
block
it not block any ads
-------------------------
block
It's a great tool. Easy to turn off, easy to customize what should get blocked. Simple interface, although the pseudo-regex (using wildcards) pattern you need to use to add to the blocked list is a little tricky... still, it never crashes and doesn't slow down Chrome!
-------------------------
block
4 stars only because there are a few popups that it doesn't block. Rarely ever happens though. A must have for any avid Internet user.
-------------------------
block
Amazing, I love how it blocks EVERY ad, and lets you block Ok type ads!
-------------------------
block
Blocks all the ads. very nice.
-------------------------
block
Wow amazing finnally all thoses annoying and unapropite adds are gone!THANK YOU SO MUCH AD BLOCK PLUS!

Blocks all ads. Perfect. Very happy :)
-------------------------
prevent
Vary useful extension...really working well in preventing ads....
-------------------------
block
Great! This is the best ad block i could find!
-------------------------
block
it does not block youtube video adds.
-------------------------
block
Eyes friendy websurfing is human rights. Blocking Ads will not kill the internet. Great noble job!

 I switched to Adblock Plus, as Adblock is no longer open source. Read this: http://jackworld.xyz/adblock-vs-adblock-plus/
-------------------------
block
Awesome it blocks almost all adds i love it very much
-------------------------
block
At first, the ABP works wonderfully. I could see the difference! Before, when I'm on Google Chrome, there would always be ads popping up - even when I accidentally clicked onto a black space! 

Then, when I installed this extension, the pop-ups lessen dramatically, and it doesn't take 2hrs for me to watch a series online.

But now, the ads comes back. I don't know if it's because the ABP has blocked too much ads to save anymore ads now or maybe its just a "30-day" trial or amazing ad-free that I don't know about and they never stated.
-------------------------
block
It works amazingly! However, if the devs could add support to block the functionality of the HQCinema Pro adware/virus, that would be awesome. This is the only issue I've had with ads since I installed ABP. 12/10.
-------------------------
block
awesome one...no ad is there when there is ad block plus.   jst love it
-------------------------
block
not blocking youtube ads
-------------------------
block
ITS NOT BLOCKING THE ADDS PERFECTLY..
-------------------------
block
this is fantastic, working nice, blocks most of the pop-ups counting in background.
-------------------------
block
I did a little test to compare this Adblock with the more popular Adblock.  This one actually blocks more ads than the Popular Adblock!  Its awesome!
-------------------------
block
It is not blocking any add.
-------------------------
block
Very effective in blocking ads and stopping numerous links to automatically open.
-------------------------
block
Ad and pop-up triggered by my ISP are not blocked.
-------------------------
block
This is a really good adblocker it blocks ads and  pop ups from even PUTLOCKER AND OTHER SITES AWESOMMEEE!(the best thing about it it that it has no payment or no fake hacker on there ITS AMAZING technology these day huh!?)
-------------------------
block
does not block adds for me :(

All ADs are not blocked and some of the pop ups were still coming
-------------------------
block
nice extension
blocking ads
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block ads.  Not even on youtube or simple iframe ads.
-------------------------
block
Thank you so much! Blocks all the ads I hate, including the pop up ones with embarrassing pictures.
-------------------------
block
If you go under options you will see something about "unobtrusive ads" and if you are okay with Adblock displaying them...doesn't make sense...you are supposed to be blocking ads! Besides that, it works like a charm. I was getting ambushed with pop ups, and now, I don't.
-------------------------
block
It's great overall, blocks most annoying ads.. problem is that it blocks "flag counter" and isnt much powerful against "bad" type of tracking services. Overall good app, been using it for a long time and dont plan to get off.
-------------------------
block
has done well for me. blocks all...you tube ads, pop under ads, pop up ads....streaming music blocks ads....good stuff!
-------------------------
block
Blocks all annoying ads!
Good job guys!

-------------------------
block
I love it.  IT EVEN BLOCKS POPUPS FROM WATCHFREE.TO AND PUTLOCKER.IS
-------------------------
block
its not blocking the adds on the side of youtube and sometimes it still takes me to a place i dont wanna be
-------------------------
block
Best ad block out on the internet :D
-------------------------
block
It was great until it started blocking and changing everything on the website and not allowing java script to run and essentially making google chrome unusable
-------------------------
block
fantastic, very customisable with the block element feature, loved it.
-------------------------
block
This is the best ad blocker I have seen and the block element feature is very useful!
Great job developers :)
-------------------------
block
never blocked any ad
-------------------------
block
doesn't block hidden adds
-------------------------
block
Brilliant works and blocks annoying ads
-------------------------
block
GREAT extension.  It shows you how many ads have been blocked (optional), and even blocks a LOT of the smut embedded IN pages.  LOVE IT!
-------------------------
block
This extension began to block everything but HTML pretty much every website I visited recently after using it for years. After a quick reinstallation everything is back to normal. All the same this is my favorite extension ever and does an AMAZING job of blocking ads.
-------------------------
block
Love it guys :) a must for web surfers. Blocks a lot of ads.
-------------------------
block
awesome app blocks all unwanted adds and links and somewhat makes the internet a little faster
-------------------------
block
Perfect for blocking ads...
-------------------------
block
This is an amazing AdBlock, it works in such an extent that it can block a malware virus from pop-ups. I highly recommend this addon to anyone who hates ads or has malware.

Works very well, blocks almost all the annoying ads as well as pop-ups. GREAT!!!

block
Nice application for ad blocking...
Awesome
-------------------------
block
great resource. my son adds it to my web browsers to keep spam adverts off my system and he even adds custom lists, for my personal prefs and it doesn't bog down my system!

GREAT EVEN FOR OLD LADIES! tested on an ASUS running Win 8.1 64-bit -touchscreen

5 STARS [smooth as silk now], and now that FanBoy's list has been added to EasyList it's 10 Stars!

note: supports international lists, so you can get comprehensive ad blocking coverage, in any region and if malwared? install the south pacific lists; especially CHINA!*

*they are why we need ad block by default and a script blocker/flash blocker. waiting on NoScript for Chrome! :D

SEE?! EVEN OLD LADIES CAN USE/INSTALL THIS! ;)
-------------------------
block
Really good, blocks tons of adds everywhere no matter what!
-------------------------
block
Does not block  some
-------------------------
block
it's not blocking roll around spam ad program which is EXTRMELY annoying!!!! otherwise i used to LOVE it and would have given it a 5
-------------------------
block
Really nice at blocking basically everything!! :D
-------------------------
block
Does exactly what it's supposed to do. You can also whitelist domains and block specific elements. Beautiful.
-------------------------
block
This app is AWESOME and blocks all ads.I suggest this app to everyone.Thanls!!!
-------------------------
block
best add-on i've ever had. if not for blocking ads on YouTube, then for all the other sites i frequently use. I AM NOT A MACHINE, I AM A HUMAN.
-------------------------
block
Really great. Blocks all ads so it works well.
-------------------------
block
Really good it has been my main adblock for over 2 yearsish maybe idk but still really good it blocks every advertisement you could ever think of !
-------------------------
block
I really love how this "extension" blocks all the ads in every website, that I go on. Really perfect, for my browsing experience.
-Declan Miles | NEONGT1
-------------------------
block
Blocks everything and even if it doesn't you can manually block this is the best extension in existence
-------------------------
block
When I installed it, I had my doubts it would do all it claims. I was happily surprised that it indeed did all it claimed. I've gotten so use to having it with it's AWESOME capabilities, hi-quality blocking, & how much better it makes surfing the internet, it's definitely an Extension I can't go without!!

**Update**
I removed AdBlock Plus & tried out other ad blockers because I wanted to see if AdBlock Plus was still the best. Within these last week I've tried all of the high-ranking, highly reviewed blockers & after all that research & trial periods, I was fed up. Only took a few days without AdBlock Plus to realize just HOW GREAT this extension really is & that there are NONE OTHERS that are even close to having anywhere near the same level of protection & blocking! IT TRULY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST AD-BLOCKER AVAILABLE TODAY!!

block
IT DID NOT BLOCK NEWS24 ADVERTS..
-------------------------
block
i love this app blocks all ads
-------------------------
block
This works great. It blocks annoying ads from most websites. On top of not seeing annoying ads it also provides another level of security from rogue ads with viruses. You can allow some ads through if you choose. Ads make free sites free so I don't mind the few that make it through.
-------------------------
block
Hasn't blocked youtube or live stream ads lately.
-------------------------
block
Must have for every browser user. Excellent features for blocking unwanted adds on pages.

Some of Advertisement still not block by ABP.
-------------------------

One of the best Ad Block apps ever.

Very good! It works on older versions of Chrome but it doesn't block text-based advertisements.
-------------------------
block
worrest it is not blocking any webstie
-------------------------
block
Very good addon, capable even blocking youtube ads.
-------------------------
block
is not blocking ads on yahoo and more
-------------------------
block
Perfect! I can choose when to block adds and when not.
-------------------------
block
Best thing ever. Only problem is that sites have been wising up and blocking access to people who have this. But of course, that's not the extension's fault. Keep on keeping on.
-------------------------
block
Wow.. Its just awesome... Blocks all the ads.. Thanks ...
-------------------------
block
it stops working randomly 
and half the time it says its working but doesn't block half the ads
-------------------------
block
nice job..it is really useful and blocks all those ads..

Love this, it is awesome!  I do not have those adds popping up blocking everything. Now I can read what type and see what is on the screen.
-------------------------
block
pretty good :x i love it, block 'em all
-------------------------
block
Is all that this addon has done is block normal advertisers and put their own pop up adds on instead. It does work well with utube though. So worth one star
-------------------------
block
CANNOT BROWSE WITHOUT AD BLOCK. GREAT APP

ad block plus blocks my ads thank you!

Will not block banner ads in Chrome. Works just fine with Facebook. Hint!
-------------------------
block
Great, helps block annoying ads from sites!

The best ad protection available from chrome. I don't even remember what an ad looks like anymore.
-------------------------
block
Very nice application.!!! If anybody have any issue pl revert me. I will suggest you the best and make sure that you will definitely change your review. Also This application is blocking adds only and if your system have any bad infections or extensions then it will not help you the most. but as I checked it, it is very good app with free of cost.
-------------------------
block
THIS DOES NOT BLOCK THE ADS
-------------------------
block
Not blocking any ads at all, it used to work just fine though.
-------------------------
block
It's very good.. Helps me always blocking all the annoying ads...
-------------------------
block
This extension is probably the best one out there. It blocks ad's on all websites, guaranteed,  plus, its a non-virus extension. 5 stars on this one.
-------------------------
block
Amazingggg blocks all ads
-------------------------
block
it is the best ever add blocking tool
-------------------------
block
+5star. Works wonderfuly. 

Please note: Anyone having trouble with adblock no longer blocking ads, close all tabs/wepbages, remove it and re-add. Works for me all the time (May require you to restart your browser)
-------------------------

Love it! It really blocking everything.

cool blocks all types of ads :)
-------------------------
block
I love this product.  I am stunned when the ad blocked counter in the upper right hand corner climbs!  I don't think I NEED that many ads to make my life complete.  A few ads seem to slip through at times but, it seems that they are the exception OR ad block is updating.  I don't say this TOO often but, if this cost any money, it would be well worth it.  Thank you so much!
-------------------------
block
Worked great, blocked ads well - with the option to turn it off for sites you wish to support. 5 Stars
-------------------------
block
doesnt block all but blocks almost all really nice love it
-------------------------
block
Perfect! Blocks ads on youtube and facebook. Doesn't work on Hulu though but I think that's just how Hulu rolls.
-------------------------
block
I love it, blocks almost everything I want it to. I'd say my rating is more of a 4.5 rather than a 5, but as I've used it for so long, it certainly deserves my 5. There's room for improvement and hopefully there will be. However, it still serves its purpose better than anything else I've seen or used.
-------------------------
block
wonderful, it block the awful advertisements on the  websites... perfect application and useful
-------------------------
block
Used this Extension for over 2 years and NEVER had an issue aside from me rolling back my PC yesterday and came to find for some reason i had to reinstall ABP along with Chrome itself due to an error; when i went to open chrome ABP was still installed but the statistics didnt show anything in the little icon window and it wasn't blocking any ads even when enabled on the current page. Still ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ definitely.
-------------------------
block
Great tool for blocking annoying ads. I'm saving valuable time every day by not being forced to watch these 30-second+ ads while browsing.
-------------------------

Blocked many non-sense adds.... good to have
-------------------------

Excellent extension for blocking ads in Chrome!

blocks all adds Absolutley great!

-------------------------
block
It blocks some items on my schools website. Works awesome besides that.
-------------------------
block
Awesome app...
It blocks every single unnecessary adds, making the page load faster.
Very Very Very Nice.
-------------------------
block
Works perfectly, with no problems... great tool for Internet casuals. Next step is adding hosts blocking to the PC and the Router (via DD-WRT).

If Miika Ahonen had viewed the .png in question, he'd see it's the adblock 'ads blocked' counter. If he stopped browsing the sites that were trying to rapidly pop-up ads, he wouldn't have that problem. You obviously did some work to find what your PC was doing, don't cry wolf on adblock.
-------------------------
block
It's awesome 
will blocks all things I don't wanna see
-------------------------
block
Does not block ads on youtube.
-------------------------
block
This extension is brilliant. Nobody should ever have to see an ad again. It's very reliable and it keeps a count of how many ads it's blocked on any given page. This thing is WAY under appreciated. Definitely a must-have!
-------------------------
block
Fantastic!  Blocks ads wonderfully, have had no issues with this extension in the months I have used it. I've recommended it to all of my coworkers and friends!
-------------------------
block
nice way to block adds on browser
-------------------------

it is not blocking all the ads!

blocks adds and everything very nicely

Great program! It blocks many ads without messing with the rest of a web page.
-------------------------
block
this app cannot block the add
-------------------------
block
Awesome! It works great!
I had it in Firefox and it worked OK, but then I noticed it here and got it! Thank you Adblock Plus for blocking annoying/inappropriate ads!
-------------------------
block
It was great and I'm a longtime user who's finally uninstalling it for the competition. 

It's now nearly impossible for me to block any advertising in gmail and I've tried to workaround this for some time. 

I suggest people look elsewhere and choose an addon that doesn't sell out.
-------------------------
block
I have found it the best tool to deny annoying ads on most every website I view. It sometimes blocks up to 600 plus on my Yahoo mail account in any given time frame. Just make sure that you delete it from Google Chrome if your computer needs to reboot due to new auto updates to your computer. I have found this wonderful tool likes to be informed that there was a system update. How do you know it's not working? If you don't see a single ad block at Yahoo Mail or some other site where there have been plenty of ads blocked in the past, delete the extension and reinstall it after a reboot. It's GREAT!
-------------------------
block
blocks every single one of 'em.. i really love this one..
-------------------------
block
it's very useful.it blocks dozens of annoying adds
-------------------------
block
good on block ads
-------------------------
block
Love how it blocks all ads. I just wish it wouldn't sometimes stop working to where I have to download it again and again. But I will always keep coming back to this. Love it!
-------------------------
bypass
Used to be great, but for the past few weeks it's been downloading extensions to Chrome every few days to create ads that will bypass it, and lately it's been redirecting me to unexpected pages on almost every link.
-------------------------
block
Highly recommend AD Block Plus, works great for blocking ads from many sites. Using it with Pandora/youtube cuts out all adverts. Be cautious when   creating custom blocks, you may be blocking too much. Other than that, enjoy, you'll love it.
-------------------------
block
best ad blocking app on the store.... job nicely done....
-------------------------
block
Love this extension. Blocks so much you don't realize how valuable it is until you use someone else's computer without it.
-------------------------

Thanks for the block

best ad block app ever
-------------------------
block
The best amongst all. blocks every embarrassing add forcefully (y)
-------------------------
block
Not blocking what I need, still get page redirects even when I add them to block list.
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus is too much better than Adblock! Block all ads automatically. Awesome!
-------------------------
block
Easily allows blocking of  pesky pop-ups not normally blocked.
-------------------------
block
Very good blocks all ads where they are needed to be blocked.
-------------------------
block
If the adblock plus could also block surveys, then it would be 5 stars. But besides that, its awesome. Recommend for all users
-------------------------
block
Cannot visit any website without having this on. It's the best ad block out there.
-------------------------
block
Better than any other ad block extension in blocking facebook ads.
-------------------------
block
This extension is amazing!! It blocks all those stupid ad's on YouTube and on any website you go on, honestly im surprised how good this is! 
5 STARS!
-------------------------
block
This is a best ever software I've used in terms of browsing protection and ad blocking. Cheers!!!
-------------------------
block
great, better than ADblock as this one can actually block youtube ads which are very annoying.
-------------------------
block
Without a doubt the absolute best Blocking Software on the market today. 100% satisfaction Highly Recommended by AnonymousNovaScotia.
-------------------------
block
It's a good adblocker, I would recommend anybody buy this. It blocks 99 out of 100 ads.
-------------------------
block
Wouldn't go online without it; whitelisting is just fine now that we can fully control it again. Can also be used to block non-ad elements that bug you.
-------------------------
block
This is unbeliveably helpful! I currently have one of the fastest Chromebooks out there and this makes it even faster! I love it! It even blocks adds on YouTube! I don't think I could go without this app  anymore! Exllent job!
-------------------------
block
I haven't found an ad that it doesn't block.  It's amazing!  Doesn't slow down the PC, actually speeds it up, because unblocked ads are what slows mine down.  

Today, it stopped working for some reason.  No big deal.  I disabled it, then re-enabled it right away, and it was working fine.  5 seconds & 2 clicks, and all was good.
-------------------------
block
it's the best blocking app
-------------------------

doesnt block a dam thing

Very good blocker, it can  
block all the annoying ad

LOVE IT!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH for blocking all the excessive and annoying ads that were always blocking my browser and leading me to other websites when I click the 'X' button. THANK YOU ADBLOCK PLUS!! Finally! I can watch all my drama in peace! =D
-------------------------

Very Great! Blocks all ads for a cleaner webpage look. It's especially useful when it comes to blocking those annoying talking ads. Love this extension.
-------------------------
block
My ABP is not blocking anything anymore. The ads on YouTube and video are showing again and I can't even skip them. Do I need to download an ABP update and if so which one? Thanks
-------------------------
block
Mine used to work but when I get a new laptop a month ago it stopped working - rather, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I don't know why.  It was wonderful when it used to block everything.
-------------------------
block
It blocks almost all of the ads, all of them except for the ones that came with my last adblocker... D: There were some annoying ones it didn't catch, but the create-your-own-filter is a wonderful thing and that blocked all the annoying ads. There's still one bit of in-text ads that I can't disable without getting rid of the whole word, but this is still the best adblocker I can find- and it didn't come with any ads!
-------------------------
block
Surfing was becoming so frustrating, with ads playing over what I was trying to watch, constant redirects and pop-up ads blocking text.  So far, it's been great and thoroughly recommend along with Adblock.
-------------------------
block
Works wonders for me! I love that it blocks all kinds of ads!
-------------------------
block
EXCELLENT FOR AD BLOCKING
-------------------------
block
Usually works fine but for some reason, every once in a while, it stops working and won't block ads so I have to uninstall it from Chrome and then reinstall. Its kind of annoying but usually this works excellently.
-------------------------
block
It works perfectly and also allow you to add your own sites to block. 5 stars all the way!!!
-------------------------
block
THIS IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!! I thought it wouldnt block some things like javascript stuff but the ads are gone without a trace.If you need a good review saying download this its awesome,this is your review.
-------------------------
block
I've used this program since it came out, and it's amazing. Unfortunately as of the last few days (05/14/14?) it has caused insane amounts of latency issues on sites such as Youtube, niconico, twitch, etc.

Hopefully it will be resolved soon, as it is an amazing program, but for now I recommend finding another solution for blocking ads, unless you want to deal with many forms of latency issues. (Still blocks ads perfectly though); 5/5 stars.

it did not block ads its annoying

Blocks ads effectively!
-------------------------
block
blocked annoying adds love it
-------------------------
block
Used to work great but has recently stopped blocking any ads.  I've since switched to AdBlock (note the capital B) and it seems to be fully functional.
-------------------------
block
Blocks all ads like it says, great app!
-------------------------
block
It simply works, and does not require babysitting. Updates itself and easy to get going and use. 
IF you do not believe me go to a site like porn, see all of the adds now open another window and turn on app, now reload window and watch just how many adds it successfully blocked. "drops mic on floor"
-------------------------
block
It does really blocked ALL annoying ads. Loved it!
-------------------------
block
Very nice. Clean design, simple to use, don't get rid of it because it is a good program. If I didn't need some of the ads just for information purposes when I'm online doing research, I would block every single ad and feel comfortable that this program has the ability to do it and I don't have to keep messing with it to tweak it to block this and that. A very useful program to cut down on spyware and other tracking junk that our computers don't need.
-------------------------
block
It doesn't block youtube ads on comodo dragon 33 (which is based on chromium, just like google chrome)
-------------------------
block
EXCELLENT FOR AD BLOCKING
-------------------------
block
It work good blocking adds but it doesn't remove I social media buttons as it says.
-------------------------
block
Love it. I hate using computers without it. The only flaw is that it no longer blocks the ads on the side of gmail when you open an email like I remember it doing before, and it sometimes allows video ads on youtube to pop up. But besides that, love it.
-------------------------
block
Excellent, blocks adds from most sites I visit. I love it!!!!
-------------------------
block
very nice, blocked 330k ads with it! i can directly watch my youtube vids and not worry about muting ads with sound.
-------------------------
block
Watching streaming video on YouTube and other Internet sites is enjoyable again.  It is great to zoom past all 2:30 minutes of commercials that used to pop up while watching my favorite shows.  I just watch the clicker tick off the number of blocked ads as it fast forwards through them in seconds.
-------------------------
block
42,196 Ads Blocked and counting! Best ad-blocker around!
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block ads on many pages...
-------------------------
block
I enjoy this extension very much because it works wonders.
Now, for people who have trouble blocking ALL ADS: listen: you must
1)go to chrome settings, then extensions
2)click on OPTIONS on the  extension Adblock plus
3) UNCHECK the box that says "allow some non-intrusive advertisements"

hope that helps!
-------------------------
block
Worked great until last few days. Now not blocking adds
-------------------------
block
Works great when it works, more often than not though it just doesn't function even when I manually block an element.
-------------------------
block
Great. Installed it a few 
hours ago and has already blocked 130 ads !

It also speeds up my internet because i dont need to load those annoying ads
-------------------------
block
Simply amazing.  No AD's ever.  Even youtube ads are blocked.  Honestly the first free app i would pay for and almost wish we could donate to.  If you like pages on facebook you CANNOT block what you call pop ups.  Macs hardly need protection but this app is a must for any mac user.If you are using windows expect some ad's but in the year i have had ad block it has blocked over 76,000 ad's.
-------------------------
block
This was working when I installed it about a week ago, but it doesn't block anything or detect anything when Chrome is in Windows 8 mode. Works fine on desktop mode though.
-------------------------
block
Wont block YouTube ads
-------------------------
block
superb ad blocking app. it never shows me any ads . Just loving it
-------------------------
block
It was very nice and helped block popup ads and my computer didnt slow down at all.
-------------------------
block
Great thing to block selected elements.
-------------------------
bypass
Amazing App. I have used ABP (and its various forks across browsers) for years. Recently it seems to not be working as well. Not sure if this is due to websites being extra diligent in bypassing ABP or what, but it has really made me realize how amazing this is when it works! Keep up the development :).
-------------------------
block
Blocks all ads on YouTube as well as websites. Great app, would recommend it.
-------------------------
block
best ad block ever! no probs what so ever! recommend to anyone who is having too much of ads! blocks ads on FB too :)
-------------------------
block
Works very well, doesn't block banners on a few foreign language sites.
-------------------------
block
Works great however it doesn't block all pop-ups. Needed to install a Java popup blocker.
-------------------------
block
It is an awesome software blocks every single ad & does not affect the internet speed
-------------------------
block
This is very useful to me as I installed an app on my PC and random ads appear everywhere and obstruct my view while browsing the web. With this extension, I can block all these unwanted ads. Thank you.
-------------------------
block
It is Amazing on how well it can block ads that are unwanted. I highly recommend this to all of my friends, and even to my girl friend. AdBlock Plus, is Amazing.
-------------------------
block
I've been using this extension for almost a year now and I've never had an issue with it. It blocks just about everything you can imagine! This is an absolute must-have.
-------------------------
block
Ap works great, 1 year and over 180,000 ads blocked. Sometimes doesn't block the youtube ads, only started to do that recently.
-------------------------
block
great extension!! also can block tracking so all those spam and tracking sites can no longer customize personal ads by watching/tracking your every move on the web. GREAT EXTENSION!!!
-------------------------
block
doesnt block ads for me
-------------------------
block
Seriously, I wish that this was available on Windows 8.1 to block ads on Windows 8 apps. I recommend this to everyone I know. (when they ask)
-------------------------
block
It's great for blocking ads... 99% of the time. There are instances where some slip bgy, but a page refresh always fixes it.
-------------------------
block
After just blocking my 76,551st ad with it, I'd say it's done a pretty good job.
-------------------------
block
doesnt even block ads
-------------------------
block
I love this addon. It blocks and clears up my screen when I have limited space on the smaller monitor.

However, lately, it has stopped working entirely and I've had to delete it and redownload it twice now. I don't touch it, either.
-------------------------
block
It doesn't block ads before videos anymore.
-------------------------
block
Very well done. It blocks what needs to be block.
-------------------------
block
No longer blocking flash/html5 player ads
-------------------------
block
Great app but no longer blocking youtube ads :(
-------------------------
block
Not blocking video ads.
-------------------------
block
Wow!! Works like a charm. Doing stuff on the internet is so much faster now that every time I want to watch a video I don't have to sit through or delete multiple ads, and every time I read an article I don't get pop ups blocking my view. My only regret is not having known about this earlier.
-------------------------
block
It's just so good...

I block all of da ads.
-------------------------
block
Works wonderfully. Sometimes you need to use a computer that doesn't have adblock plus to really appreciate the annoying stuff it blocks for you.
-------------------------
block
Amazing extension, but often buggy/inefficient. Nevertheless it's a free, safe tool that blocks 98% of ads, and I'm extremely grateful for its existence.
-------------------------
block
Great extension, and has never failed to block all annoying ads. However recently it no longer blocks youtube ads. Is it just me?
-------------------------
block
This is the one you want. Excellent blocking of video ads.  especially on Olympic coverage. love it.
-------------------------
block
This is the most useful extension that I've seen so far! And it's easy to use - you just add some of the preset filters, which are divided by country. You can also easily block ads, which are not in the filters. I definitely recommend AdBlock+!
-------------------------
block
I got this because of the YouTube ad block.
It will NOT block the YouTube ads like it says. :'(
-------------------------
block
Couldn't live without it, since I simply CANNOT stand ads for those stupid "weight-loss" supplements which appear on every single website. Furthermore, it's pretty good about blocking those ads out there which, when loaded by your browser, install all sorts of nasty viruses and adware.
-------------------------
block
AMAZING!!! Always blocks every single add on ANY website and you can finally use the internet without any annoying adds! Props to the creator!!!!
-------------------------
block
This is awesome, now I don't have to face those stupid ads on youtube. But I wish this would block audio ads on Spotify too. Other than that this is perfect!
-------------------------
block
It is a great app and extension that simply blocks Ads(google adsense) from websites i surf on daily basis.
-------------------------
block
this is the best extension ever. there are no ads on pirate bay or facebook. it averages 65 ads blocked on facebook everytime i go on
-------------------------
block
The other Adblock causes serious lag for me. This works just as well, and doesn't slow down Chrome. And I don't know what the other user was talking about, it blocks ads from those sites just fine.
-------------------------
block
Works very well. And I'm glad I have the option to not block ads on certain sites, and even more importantly, to allow some non-intrusive advertising on all sites, which I hope will help keep the web mostly free while at the same time curbing the horrible ads that make some sites unbearable. Nice job, devs.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block anything!
-------------------------
block
It was great, but it's not blocking anything anymore. Please update :)

EDIT: I reinstalled ABP and it's working fine now!
-------------------------
block
It blocks unwanted ads most of the time and I am loving it specially the youtube ads before the videos which annoys most of the people. We are in youtube to see the videos not the adds.
I am loving it:))))
-------------------------
block
It doesn't block a singe ad....
-------------------------
block
Works great most of the time, but on some web sites it doesn't block the ads.
-------------------------
block
Does not seem to block pop-up ads for me when I visit certain websites. Other than that, I love it. Even tells you how many ads its blocked in your history of using it. ^-^
-------------------------
block
doesn't block youtube ads
-------------------------
block
All in all it's good at blocking ads, but is behind the Firefox version because it doesn't block the pop ups  which Adblockplus 2.4.1 for Firefox does.
-------------------------
block
So out of nowhere, this app stopped blocking items in Chrome. It was really frustrating. Through some poking around, I found out that the filter subscription section in ABP options was empty. I clicked on "Add Filter Subscriptions" and "EasyList" popped up and was enabled. Now everything is back to normal, and most items are being blocked. I think something happened with the last Chrome update that caused this to happen, but all is good now.
-------------------------
block
Used to be awesome now doesn't block anything. Please fix
-------------------------
block
Absolutely essential to block out those pesky ads. I love this extension therefore kudos to the creator. Great Job!
-------------------------
block
WOW I can't believe how many ads have been blocked by this extension. Every time I go to a website, I keep seeing the amount of ads that have been blocked and I'm still shocked. I can cruise through the web without waiting anymore. Although I can't seem to stop ads on Hulu, I don't mind. But I feel like 99 percent of the time this thing works great! Even blocks the ads on facebook! WOW. I'm donating money to them right now. Thank you for the amazing service/ extension you've created. I really appreciate it!
-------------------------
block
This extension is really the best AdBlocker.
I've heard loads of complaints about their AdBlocker blocking their videos, bugging out an not blocking anything.. Not for AdBlock Plus! It has always worked 100% since the beggining!
-------------------------
block
Works fine for me. I've used this adblocker ever since I found out they existed, and it hasn't let me down. I love the feature 'block element' to get rid of those little ads that websites try to sneak past this.
-------------------------
block
It Doesn't Block Youtube Ads
-------------------------
block
Excellent extension and I really like the (opt-out) exception made for non-intrusive adverts. My only complaint would be that the firstrun screen has useful configuration options which don't appear in the main program options.

Even more useful would be a way to see how many items were blocked by each list, thus allowing you to eliminate lists which weren't pulling their weight.
-------------------------
block
doesn't block everything
-------------------------
block
Many ads on many websites are not being blocked as of late. Trying new adblocker
-------------------------
block
Blocks Pandora ads- YES!
-------------------------
block
Good stuff - ESPECIALLY for watching sports and other TV programs that you cannot get in your part of the world (such as NFL football in SouthEast Asia) - blocks annoying AND SOMETIMES DANGEROUS pop-ups nicely!!
-------------------------
block
Ive been using ABP for about 2 years now. I have grown to like this. It helps alot when you are gaming or for the anime lovers out there. I recommend this to anyone who is using the internet. When using chrome though, you have to becareful. it does after some time stop blocking ads. Why is this? Wish ABP would do a update to fix this though.
-------------------------
block
Use the other one does not block adds on Pandora and the other one does.
-------------------------
block
Was good for a very long time then today it randomly stopped working. Every site I went to ABP said it was blocking ads but it was not. I just re-installed it and it seems to be working fine now.
-------------------------
block
It doesn't always block adds. I still have adds on all of the websites that I open the Adblock is enabled on.
-------------------------
block
Ok for everybody else who noticed it stopped blocking youtube ads, uninstall and re-install it. I just did it, it worked for me IJS...
-------------------------
block
It's Awesome.. blocks all annoying ads when i browse....
-------------------------
block
Does not block facebook ads or google ads. It used to work.
-------------------------
block
Perfect for any browsing.  Keep an eye on it when you're experiencing website problems though, it may be protecting you from popups you're attempting to produce.  Simply allow that site through the block temporarily (or permanently!) and you're golden.  I'd recommend this anyone.
-------------------------
block
Works like a charm most of the time, some ads don't seem to be blocked, but for the most part it's reliable. It stops Video ads so if you spend long hours browsing Youtube like me you'll love this.
-------------------------
block
Does it's job without too much user interaction. Love it! This and a custom hosts file is almost a perfect way to block all unwanted adds and pop-ups.
-------------------------
block
It is working good, almost all advertisements are blocked and I can also add an own rules.
But for some flash ads, it cannot block it.
-------------------------
block
It is not blocking YouTube adds anymore! :-(
-------------------------
block
This is so awesome! I've blocked over 6500 ads!
-------------------------
block
Not blocking youtube ads. So bad
-------------------------
block
Stopped blocking ads for me within the last few days, but i went into the options (from extensions page) and realized i needed to add a filter 'subscription' (Easylist) again. not sure why it went away, but for anybody confused about seeing ads, try this! BTW, adblock plus makes the internet a wonderful place, thanks so much for all your effort devs. ALL CREDIT GOES TO BRAD LORENZEN
-------------------------
block
I love it! Blocks all those annoying ads on stuff like piratebay, and even youtube! I give this 5 out of 5 stars.

Best Blocking Software, I recommend it all Ad haters

Adblocker does not block ads -_-
-------------------------
block
It is not blocking ads. It is just installed and thats it.
-------------------------

Not blocking the annoying video ads on Youtube most of all, but it's not blocking any other ads either anymore. Used to work wonderfully.
-------------------------
block
It's pretty good, however, be prepared to see youtube consistently refreshing itself because it's blocking ads. It sucks because you can never back track after watching a video.
-------------------------
block
Awesome extension,great for blocking unwanted and un needed popups!
-------------------------
block
Does what it is supposed to. Very Good! Although it used to block Youtube ads, but I guess youtube updated their stuff. Still, this is still a good blocker

This is the best extension in the store! Blocks ads on YouTube, Facebook, and any other site you are surfing.

block
I don't even know how did you guys manage to block the youtube ads but it's pure genius! Love it!
-------------------------
block
Has been brilliant since I downloaded it. Now it is not very efficient on some pages for whatever reason. Worked ok last night on another pc, but on the chromebook, it's not blocking ads any more. When it works, it's great.
-------------------------
protect
It helps not only against intrusive ads but to protect privacy as well. Thank you.
-------------------------
prevent
It's a very helpful app to prevent unwanted advertisement. I love this app. And recommended    to other to use it frequently.
-------------------------
block
Amazing! The reason I was looking for this is because, I'm not sure when, ad-ware got into my computer. Lucky for me, this blocks it!
-------------------------
block
nice one form all add block for every sites
-------------------------
block
Amazing add-on! It automatically blocks ads on the page. Always gives u a clean page. Love it.
-------------------------
block
very useful application and blocks each and every    ad.very happy with this app. love it
-------------------------
block
Amazing Adblocker! Blocks  all ads before page loads!
-------------------------
block
Never had a problem with it. Does exactly what it promises. It blocks ads all over the web. I'm quite pleased.
-------------------------
block
Was using this for almost 8 months now without any problems but Now it seems it is no longer blocking ads; they are filtering through on websites. Kindly look into it and do the needful
-------------------------
detect
Really amazing. I don't have problems with ads getting through. But I do have certain websites that detect the extension and make me wait longer to stream videos and such. But other than that, pretty great!
-------------------------
block
Blocks ads for youtube and when watching tv shows on various websites. It is very nice. It does not stop your browsing data from being recorded. If you ask it too block them, it does some. Ghostely does the rest for me. Between the two, you have a lot of control over what advertisement companies can do to and "for you."
-------------------------
block
Very happy with this. Needs to be reinstalled occasionally to continue blocking ads, but otherwise my favorite adblocker I've found.
-------------------------
block
I haven't noticed any problems with the app as of yet all in all it seems to be a very good ad blocking extension.
-------------------------
block
Though I haven't found one of the top tier ad block extensions I didn't appreciate, I feel this extension edges slightly ahead of the rest.  The completeness of the program like the ability to remove the temptation of tweet/like buttons on websites (that track your browsing habits) is unmatched.

Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
I hate adds! now I don't have to boycot every annoying brand that violates my eyes! Thank you oh creator of add block
-------------------------
block
been using it for years now.... by far the best ad blocking there will ever be, across all platforms you want to use!
-------------------------
block
it works for basic ads but it does not block video ads.
-------------------------
block
it is better than adblock because it blocks ads and pop up windows in sumotorrent.
-------------------------
block
it doesn't block anything!
-------------------------
block
does not block YouTube ads

It was great on Chrome...now since Chrome has been updated...my ABP is not blocking any pop ups.

On BBC news, the addon not only prevents the ads from playing, but the videos too :(

I'd love an update!

Still does not block youtube ads.

Doing an excellent job blocking ads.
-------------------------

Awesome blocks all ads

love it more than any other ad block extension. much faster too, and doesn't slow down browsing. great to have!
-------------------------
block
Does not block ads anymore. Even when non intrusive ads are disabled, it still shows them.
-------------------------
block
It's not blocking anything :(
-------------------------
block
I'll tell you, this is the best AD blocking extension that I've come across. It really demolishes that "ads not by this site" vermin! I never write reviews... BUT I HAD TO WRITE THIS ONE... It's that good.
-------------------------
block
Adblock used to be a great extension, blocking all ads. Now, Google is paying them to display ads on YouTube. Great, Adbloc, just great.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block ads.

not blocking ads in recent times :(

block
Can you please make the update button "UPDATE"? because it's  really an eyesore every time I see an ad that isn't blocked
-------------------------

Whip the damned block, great!

This is really good, blocks for everything, and easy to disable if I really really wanted, recommended to my friends and family :)

awesome and has blocked over 50,000 adds in less then a year. and one time 27 adds on one facebook page!  love it
-------------------------
block
really nice, also blocks a lot of spam that constantly comes up
-------------------------
block
great app but youtube did an update n now its not blocking youtube adds
-------------------------
block
Recently stopped blocking Youtube advertisements. I hope that this is fixed soon. Otherwise it has worked wonders.
-------------------------
block
Google is paying the Adblock plus team to not block their ads...
-------------------------
block
Best ad block EVER! Have had it a year or so!
-------------------------
block
Used to love adblock, it was perfect. Since a couple of weeks (as far as I know) they are accepting payment from google to allow (ie not block)  "Ad related to" at the top of Google search results. There is no indication whatsoever where sponsored search results end and genuine search results begin. My biggest gripe in months and a waste of good time, since sponsored links usually aren't what I am looking for.

If an adblock alternative stops bye I will start using it.
-------------------------
block
it works just fine reinstall it if the ads stop blocking
-------------------------
block
Very nice additional blocking features added.
Goes beyond the adblock plus plug-in used in Firefox. Well done.
-------------------------
block
There is a Russian drop down ad that is not blocked if you have Image Hover Zoom.  Please fix this.  Love your extension.
-------------------------
block
I've been using this add-on for years, I love it. I couldn't imaging browsing the web without it. Truly makes my browsing experience much more enjoyable. Also, if you're having problems with it not blocking some  things you need to manually update your block lists.
-------------------------
block
Love it! Continue blocking away!!!!!
-------------------------
block
Does not block youtube ads
-------------------------
block
I must say i am very impressed. I have tried many other adblockers but this one must be the best one i have ever discovered it blocks youtube ads facebook ads and every ad that does ever exist. Definitely what i got promised.Great work!
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block all adds on websites I visit. Adblock is much better.
-------------------------
block
Just love it! Block all those annoying ads!
-------------------------
block
I love that you can remove any form of ad yourself if it is not blocked already
it makes google chrome a lot more enjoyable, thank you Ad Block Plus!
-------------------------
block
it is the best application that you will ever find....it blocks all anonymous advertisements tht eatup your bandwidth
-------------------------
block
It didn't block youtube ads
-------------------------

doesn't work on CDAN and it will drive you crazy all the ads and videoes they have on that site that can't be blocked.

Great extension and a must have. Easily allows you to create your own filters and block just about anything.
-------------------------
block
its epic, blocks ads, just hope its safe, but reviews are fine SO YEAH

prevent
This app did not prevent ads from popping on my facebook account.

-------------------------
block
NICE! IT BLOCKS ALL UNWANTED ADS!
-------------------------
block
I love this app its really helpful; You can't go wrong! It doesn't slow down your computer, and it blocks ads! What isn't there to love?
-------------------------
block
Does exactly what I need, blocks ads. Simple and doesn't slow down my browser. Highly recommend.
-------------------------
block
I love AdBlock Plus! I had it on Firefox and it was great at keeping 95% of the pop-ups at bay, and 100% keeping stupid sidebar ads on facebook and yahoo away. I was hoping they made an extension for chrome when I made the switch, imagine my delight! :) I fully endorse AdBlock Plus!

*UPDATE* I still love ABP, but on facebook, it only intermittently blocks the sponsored ads :/ Hopefully, they find a permanent fix to this.
-------------------------
block
I used adblock before this.. but it rather slowed down my PC.. but when i installed this i gotta know that it has malware,tracker,ad blocking features. Man i like this!!works almost same as adblock but it has more functions to do so its ok.
-------------------------
block
really helpful, blocks annoying ads, absolutely love it
-------------------------
block
Blocks every ad that I would have normally noticed and works perfectly fine I have found.
-------------------------
block
I love this program, I've had no issues with it and it does what it promises. It also allows you to customize what you want blocked or not! Amazing!
-------------------------
block
the best app for blocking ads...
-------------------------
block
blocks the annoying ads,banners and saves data usage. awesome app.
-------------------------
block
Very useful app. THANKS EVERYONE who was involved in making this. This blocks almost all the ads and popups that bother us! Thanks again
-------------------------
block
The extension as is is great and awesome but they use this now to make money... with ads that aren't getting blocked.

Read about it on mobilegeeks.
-------------------------
block
I recommend getting this, you'll love it. Blocks all those pesky, annoying ads.
-------------------------
block
It was great until now; it stopped blocking videos on youtube.
-------------------------
block
Does not block videos on youtube.
-------------------------
block
I have nothing bad to say about it! It blocks every single ad I have seen, including the ones before YouTube videos. A great extension to have!
-------------------------
prevent
it did a good job from preventing ads from domain!
-------------------------
block
Brilliant. Never had issues. Always blocks adds, and when using another computer I am shocked to see all adds come back! That makes me run to this app again :P
-------------------------
block
I have noticed that it does indeed block all ads.  I have never had any ads on any computer I use Google Chrome on.  I say this is the best Ad-blocker because it does not slow the computer unlike some others.
-------------------------
block
Not blocking ads nowadays. Getting lot of ads on youtube!
-------------------------
block
What I love about this, is that especially with facebook, you can alter how much get's blocked. So now even ads promoting other facebook features and applications (within facebook) are blocked!
-------------------------
block
Works great. Best ad blocking software out there.
-------------------------
block
Have yet to see an ad since ad block was installed. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
Best ad blocker ever!

And to the people that say it doesn't block some ads, if you click on the ABP icon you can click and add it to the filter and BAM that ad doesn't show again
-------------------------
block
Almost perfect! Been using ABP for a year and only twice has it had a relapse and stoped blocking ads. Cant sem to figure out why, any ideas?

Works great with ALL facebook suggestions :D
-------------------------
block
This is a pretty cool app . Does what it said it will do block all unwanted ads simple and useful
-------------------------
block
I is usually very good, but what i have noticed is that u get newer ads that it doesn't block unless u re-add to chrome!
-------------------------
bypass
Generally awesome app, though, it looks like FB has just figured out how to bypass the filters again. :(
-------------------------
block
Excellent but it does fail sometimes to block some ads on some pages. I think, the app may try the cloud computing technology to collect urls or provide provisions to send urls to be added to a global list where other users can benefit from it. But that's ok as we have the manual blocking system of ads by adding our own filters. Thank you for taking care of our privacy on the web and peace of mind from annoying ads.

If google is making a work around to get past this app and show us ads, we have other options too ;) So, I don't think google will risk doing that.
-------------------------
block
doesnt block youtube videos
-------------------------
block
It works magically! Really does work to block every single ad there is!
-------------------------
block
It's very good. But some tines it is not able to block some adds. I don't know why it happens?
-------------------------
block
By far, the bast ad blocking plugin you can have on your Chrome browser. Period.
-------------------------
block
it gives me ads instead of blocking them!!!!!!!
-------------------------
block
This app is AMAZING!
Now, pages load faster, because before ad block plus, the page would load in 7 seconds, and ads 15.  i used to think the internet would be like this forever. but NOT ANY MORE!
(I have used Ad block plus for 2 years!)
-------------------------

everytime i search for something, i get an ad.  when i try to click on the website i want, i get an ad.  it seems that i'm getting EVERY ad in the universe instead of blocking them.....

Works great with Chrome and Firefox.  Especially good at blocking facebook and youtube ads.

Wow this app is cool.  It cleans up all the annoying adds on every site and makes them load faster.  Even blocks the stupid youtube ads at the start of videos.  Thanks!
-------------------------

The best ad blocking solution for Chrome and Firefox. The other popular ad block extension hijacks your browser home page, and each time re-directs to their home page asking for donation.
-------------------------

I strongly prefer the Adblock Plus approach of blocking annoying ads will allowing ads that are not annoying (e.g. do not consume cpu resources, etc.).

This encourages all the websites that must depend on advertising to prefer well behaved, non-annoying, static ads.

All ad blockers should follow the lead of Adblock Plus in encouraging responsible and considerate advertisements.
-------------------------
block
Works great. Blocks all those annoying adds. I hate them dearly. Great product.

Thanks! its great, but doesn't block "EVERY" ad.

ABSOLUTELY AWESOME...
it blocks all ads, which is a real relief, including the long annoying youtube ones
-------------------------

Successfully blocks the ads on FB-- such a relief.  I also use Ghostery for anti tracking
-------------------------

I used it on Firefox, and tried it on Chrome. Works  good, with some quirks, which may not be the problem of Adblock Plus (v1.4), however, they don't happen with Adblock :
- back button problem on some important sites (amazon, lifehacker, etc.) Chrome
- right click to block elements often doesnt't work

I hope these issues get solved soon (then I will re-rate). Otherwise, great add-on.
-------------------------

Surprised Google allows this on their store considering it blocks their own ads. Great!
-------------------------

Its great blocks all ads!

Works really good but it does not block youtube ads any more

It's able to block advertisements from most of the websites, definitely good for those who don't like ads!

it did work and now it doesnt block ads

Blocking ads resposibly, and allowing us to block our own elements in a web-page (I don't use the  languages bar at all in wiki) makes it the best!

It's so good that it's gotten to the point where it's manditory. And the best part? look up the "Allow some non-intrusive ads" I always hated thinking I am standing in the way of some of my favorite small websites from making income by blocking their ads, but thanks to this feature, they can allow their ads to get through as long as they aren't obnoxious. Seriously, good job.
-------------------------
block
great extension but it has yet to block "sponsored ads" on facebook and youtube. it has just started this problem but before that, it has been great.
-------------------------
block
Has recently stopped working (Chrome on Win8) to block "Sponsored Ads" on Facebook and other sites. Please fix this glitch. Have been using AdBlock and ABP for quite a number of years. Until now it's worked flawlessly.
-------------------------
block
5 Stars, awesome extension. Blocks any ads   that I wanted to block, or the already specified filters that you guys made. I made my own filters but never released them to the public, because I felt the need they needed more  ads to be blocked. 

This is really good if you can't find a way to block ads, but I think you should add a survey remover to this. It might be nice for everyone to see a survey remover that works :) .

Pretty good plugin, I'm hoping that you took my suggestions.

Thanks,

I have been a fan of adblock plus for almost a year now and i have loved it! However, recently i have started seeing adds again, and whilst some can be blocked with the "block element" function, others cannot.
Please fix this with an update! 
Thankyou

Its not blocking ads anymore!!!!!!

I love this more than the other normal version, with this PLUS version you can add your trusted domains and (flash players) if they got blocked by default.

This adblock extension is awesome! It blocks all ads on the sites I go on most! It makes my internet move jet fast and it is great for annoying ads that you'd normally see on sites like Addicting Games and other flash game sites. Parents, I suggest this for your kids and for yourself for your safety.

This is the best ad blocking program (in my opinion) I use it every time I install Chrome now. And it gets rid of annoying adverts in YouTube.

Seems to be quicker than the regular Ad Block

Blocks annoying ads, leaving text-only and static images around so websites can still earn the money they need to run. Pretty slick.

was good until it stopped blocking certain ads. certain websites have a video ad that adblock doesn't filter. otherwise good app.

Adblock Plus is a fantastic tool and add-on for Firefox, it allows you to block internet ads, block un-wanted images, which generally speeds up loading time on websites. 
It's easy to configure and has a set list of known ad suppliers to block so you don't have to input anything.

Google Chrome is THE best browser. Google, I am hypnotized by your products... They are simple, dependable, and most importantly, your products are mostly free while still offering a gigantic variety of products and services that people depend upon from day to day. I must admit, even my beloved phone is a Google Android... My iPhone was water damaged in a sea kayaking capsize (the dry-bag was not appropriately closed) and I have been much happier with my Droid! Adblock, you are delightful and you pair with Chrome to(somehow?) create an even smoother browsing experience. Well, it's obviously because of the blocked advertisements. I am devout to both Google and AdBlock. Yesterday I opened my Firefox browser for the first time since reformatting my laptop. It was messy, slow, spammy, something Chrome was not before installing these extensions and applications. After installing the same extensions in Firefox and testing it out for a night, I gave up and quickly ran back into the comforting arms of Google Chrome! Firefox was horrifying. I had to remove so many toolbars and search engines, specifically YAHOO!, that I never installed. No other person has the keys to my laptop either... I always specify "NO" when installing programs that ask. These toolbars were never present within my Chrome and it was my first time opening Firefox since its initial installation. Firefox was a boggy nightmare. Thank you, Google, for so many privileges. I do not take these for granted. Customer service is supreme from my experiences compared to other websites. Considering the overload Google has, it is astonishing to me. Google even pays me! How much more could I, or anyone for that matter, ask of Google?
-------------------------
prevent
While not quite as robust as NoScript in Firefox, AdBlock Plus adds major security (and removes annoyance) from Chrome. Removing adverts not only makes the page cleaner, but can also help prevent "drive-by" attacks from infected web sites. 

Please support the developers of this excellent and necessary tool!

It worked very nicely. It even blocked YouTube ads on videos! But now I'm starting to see ads again. I don't know if it's an update from YouTube that does this or an update from Adblock Plus that does it. Hopefully it will be like it used to

Blocks most ads-it was working great, but it updated and now allows ads on Pandora. I tried disabling the allowed ads, but they still keep showing up.
-------------------------

Love this extension - though now it blocks Adsense even though I whitelisted it.

Best ad blocker for chrome. Better than adblock. Adblock doesn't block all ads and also does emotional blackmails showing the donate banner. Adblock plus (this app) is far far better.
-------------------------
block
Works great.  When I log into my other email accounts it even blocks the ads that run along the side.  Prevents my computer from slowing down since it keeps all the scripts from running.  Worth downloading!
-------------------------
block
Works quickly and efficiently. But no longer blocks audio ads on Pandora (though I can skip them atleast) and now I see some side ads on Facebook, including recommended pages. This was not so before. Either those sites adapted or Chrome update changed the effectiveness of ADP Beta. Good overall. though.
-------------------------
block
Really good for blocking stupid ads. love it.
-------------------------

Excellent add-on. The sites I visit are now so much faster and I get to my content much faster. Very effective at blocking most in-page ads and all pop-ups (:

works great with the exception of 1 or 2 ads every now and then but i'm happy as most of the ads are blocked.

This Add-On I A Great Add-on I Blocks Any Add How I Don't Know But I Recommend it Because it blocks Adds From YouTube, to forced ads on random websites. i wish u fell the Same About it.

Very Nice App. Blocks EVERY Add EVERYWHERE (including Text Ads ;) )

I love it. Not only does it block ads, it also has a feature that allows it to block unfiltered and annoying webpage elements. Everyone should have it on there Chrome.

does a good job of blocking unwanted content by spammers and protect from viruses too

Ads keep many websites free. I strongly recommend you don't block ads, or at least white-list the majority of your frequented sites.

Love it, and I love how you can set the level of blocking.

Best add blocker that I know of! I used to use it in Firefox and it worked great, now in chrome only a few things have changed; it's still the best one by far. Though it's not as good as the Firefox version, It still blocks all the adds on every website I've been on without blocking good content (it even works for GrooveShark!)
-------------------------
block
Does what it's supposed to best: blocks ads and possible malicious content, even when it is a false positive!  Thanks, developer!
-------------------------
block
I love this extension ... the only thing I think that needs corrected is the fact that when you start Chrome and the previous session loads the extension doesn't block the adware before loading the pages.
-------------------------

the normal adblock isn't blocking ads on youtube anymore :/ thank God we have this!

Blocks all ad's perfectly for me (Websites, YouTube, Live Steams), only thing it's ever missed is removing the table where the ad was, but even this is very rare.

I really like the extension. It makes watching youtube videos that one bit easier without the annoying advertisement. It makes those annoying ads go away when i'm trying to read or download something. :D Thank you it is a great app and i will recommend. I also tried AdBlock but that didnt work as well because when i went on different sites it didn't block the ads.
-------------------------
block
Seems to work rather well on the RockMelt browser. Unsurprising , as it is written with Chrome code. Had a few issues where ads stopped being blocked, but a re-installation and refresh worked fine. Really good app.
-------------------------
block
I like this product... but there is one thing I do not like. I don't like when you watch a Youtube video and there is a 30 second ad you have to go through. So AdBlock does not block the ads on a YouTube video.. but I like everything else about it.
-------------------------
block
Great add-on for chrome. Silently blocks advertising on a wide range of websites. Very effective!
-------------------------
prevent
It works great pretty much EVERYWHERE except Livestream and Facebook. It prevents me from seeing a Livestream so I have to turn it off on Livestream and go through video ads. No big deal really.

But Facebook ads are an issue. I notice a lot of them are coming through. That needs to be fixed. Otherwise, awesome extension. Haven't seen an annoying ad anywhere (except Facebook and Livestream) in a long time. It's especially awesome on YouTube.
-------------------------
block
Been using this for a year or so and I absolutely love it.

Blocks all ads on many of the streaming sites I visit. Although it may occasionally miss an ad or two, all I have to do it disable the element and reload the page for the blocker to kick in.

I don't have a top notch PC but this does -not- slow chrome down on my dekstop OR laptop. I'm not quite sure why there are so complaints of this slowing people down... I haven't had any problems with it.

THIS IS JUST GREAT! Even though video sharing sites talk about disabling, ad block still disables ads on videos and what I mean is I forgot my hulu password so i was watching a video for free and something came up saying please enable ads, this is just great!
-------------------------
block
I love this so much. It totally blocks the ads, I have forgotten that they were ever there! I really recommend this. One time, it did cause chrome to crash, though. Once.
-------------------------

Add the right click blocking option... else works fine
-------------------------

Just today it started blocking Google Plus from loading at all. Something to do with the redirect structure. For now I have added it to the whitelist and that seems to help, but hope the developers are paying attention to this issue!
-------------------------
block
Speaking as someone who uses both regularly for nearly the same functions, I agree with a previous reviewer - for some reason, Adblock Plus is WAY more effective at blocking ads in Chrome than Firefox. Even video ads on sites like YouTube, DailyMotion, etc get blocked, in addition to the regular annoying pop-ups/sidebar ads/etc. Highly recommend it!
-------------------------
block
So far, I have found this to be a very good extension. It blocks almost all ads on the websites I visit. My only problem is that sometimes there will be these large gaps on the sides of web pages were the ad banners used to be. But then again, it's better than the ads.

Overall, great extension.

This is the ad blocking extension you want.

Adblock Plus (Beta) for Chrome is not as powerful as its Firefox companion, but it is continuously improving. At first release, video ad blocking was spotty but it is now nearly on par with its Firefox companion. Video ad blocking works far better compared to the other popular Adblock extension in the Chrome Web Store. 

Banner ads and in-line text ads blocking work very well. I do allow ads from some of my favorite sites where the ad placements aren't overwhelming understanding that is how they raise revenue.
-------------------------

I don't rate Google extensions but this is absolutely amazing. I absolute hate watching ads on youtube and this blocks them. Simply couldn't say anything better

My review being I've had a lot of problems with ads I thought it might be a virus because they were popping up in my FB messages and blocking all side videos related to a video i may have been watching on youtube (BTW I use Chrome) so I just got this and it worked wonders now there are no ads my videos are not lagging by them no ads in my messages it was fantastic And my side videos are now there again..there is sometime a blank box where an ad should be but i think that  may be the virus i may have even so nothings in the box everything else is fantastic Thank you for this so much!

Would like to say I have had adblock and ABP installed. It made my pc very slow, very loud but all ads were blocked.

I decided to get rid of just ADBLOCK...my pc no longer makes loud noises. the ram has dropped from 1.8 to 1.25gb maximum and I feel very happy :) please download ABP over AB...they both use the same filters for blocking ads the extensions DO NOT block ads ... the filters do...

Great AD-blocker, honestly. I have had zero-problems with it and it seems to work just fine blocking unwanted ADs that I am not interested in seeing.
-------------------------

I liked it in general and since youtube has Ads on there it makes everything hell on youtube. Honestly. If you are here to block youtube ads don't just wait the 14-30 seconds. Because you always see an error occurred on EVERY video. But otherwise GREAT :P

Great, it works very well. It doesn't block all ads but it hides most of them. Highly recommendable.

Does not get every single ad on the internet and it lately is letting all ads through. This extension is nice and VERY fast when it's compared to other adblock extensions.

Fix the recent issue of all ads getting through, and try to make it easier to block ads on a page using the "Easy create filter" option.
-------------------------
block
This worked really well when I first got it. Now it will not block the more common "AdSense" or "AdChoices"  AD's. Will there be an update fix?
-------------------------
block
I have found this to be, BY FAR, the best ad blocker out there. I've never had an issue with it, the ability to add your own filters is simply fantastic, block certain things on websites from loading, it is so versatile and works brilliantly, i recommend it to everybody i know. Simply Brilliant.

Does not block ads while watching videos online. But is ok for everything else it seems

My God people stop complaining so much.  This is a great extension. No way its going to block 100% of the ads, the ad agencies will always find ways to bypass this.  Be greatful that it works well.  This extension is awesome, makes browsing the web so much better.

I used Ad Block Plus with Firefox and I loved it.  This one works well but doesn't block all of the advertisements in video sites like South Park Studios and Hulu, for example.  It still works well, but that's one thing that the firefox version has over this one for Chrome.  If this could be fixed it would be fantastic and I'd give this app five stars.  Thank you!

EASILY the best ad-blocker I've ever found. Wanna block a specific element you don't like on a page? The feature to do so is readily available, just a few clicks, then bam, you have access to block anything possible. Wanna stop ad-blocking because you want to give a few cents to a kind stranger? Done, with nothing but a click within the menu. I definitely recommend getting it, because it not only works incredibly well, but others have mentioned how they've been using it for years without a problem in other reviews, and I've found proof of that firsthand. Not a single ad, no weirdness, nothing; it's genuinely near flawless. Easiest 10/10 of my LIFE.

Edit: yeah, I was right, I just didn't know how right I was. For any who somehow stumble across this review, if you have something like those premium subscription pop-ups that sometimes slip through, you can block those as well using the built-in feature. Just click the block option in the menu that pops up when you click on the extension next to the search bar at the top, and hover over what you want to block, then move the mouse around the general area until it highlights the full part of what you want to block, including its background. If you're having trouble going back to the normal page and you have been blocked from interacting with it, then you can open a new tab (or duplicate it), reload your current one, or press the back button. There's also an option to un-block something in the settings if you wish to do so, although you can just fully disable ad blocking for the specific page you're on within that same menu that you used earlier.

I've used AB and ABP for longer than I can even remember. It was the greatest extension/app I could have ever asked for and I wish I had money to donate regularly. I work in internet repair and recommend this for every customer who mentions pop-ups. ABP is synonymous with a no-bs anti-popup software that does exactly what it says it will AND THEN SOME! I've never made an extension review but honestly it's about time I show appreciation for the creators and developers that made this app.

I've tried out several ad blockers including my browser's built in adblocker but nothing beats AdblockPlus. It keeps adds, those pesky push notifications and irritating cookie warnings that take up half the article you're reading, away.

I was pretty skeptical since I've never used an ad blocker before and I wasn't exactly sure how it would even work. My intention was simply to get rid of the annoying pop-ups that would appear over youtube videos, but I had no idea that it would actually stop commercials from playing when watching any online video, as well! This is incredible! All I had to do was download and the ad-blocker just worked on it's own. I didn't even have to worry about downloading malware with it, like most online downloads. This is amazing!

Amazing adblocker which meets all my needs. The UI on the settings menu is easy to use and look at, unlike adblockers I've used in the past. Needs popup blocking though
-------------------------
popup
The Thing is, when i installed this i was skeptical about how it worked ant stuff, but after using this in many sites, it works PERFECTLY, i only needed a Adblock to block Popup ads so the scenario may depend, but this works like a charm if you need one for popup ads.

Great for blocking unwanted popups and sometimes works on streaming.

I really love Adblock Plus!

It automatically blocks almost every advertisement, even the annoying popup ones on YT videos. It also makes pages load a lot faster on my outdated computer which is a huge plus.

One feature that I really like is being able to whitelist individual websites so AB+ won't block their ads. That gives me the ability to support websites that I like by allowing them to earn a little ad revenue from me. It also makes me feel like I have a lot more control over my privacy.

used to be good but popups and other ad banners are not being blocked now
-------------------------
popup
I must say this is no exception. There are other kinds of Adblockers that work well and sometimes can remove all sorts of pop-ups, inconsistent scripts and as well as dangerous malware that can spam the PC.

But rather, I would stick with this kind extension because it definitely works very well with ease. No matter what website should I go to watch cartoons, play games or even search online.

I installed ABP on my Chromebook sometime last year, and it did a dang good job at keeping ads away. Lately though, I tend to get pop-ups (which just open a new tab in my browser) whenever I click a link on a page I'm trying to browse. It's very irritating and some of these ads won't go away (I try to click "leave" and it just refreshes the page). What happened ABP?
-------------------------
popup
I use this add-on to block porn ads and web cam pop-ups, but now it doesn't stop the porn anymore!

ABP the best popup blockers, used it for some time and never had any issues with it, really helps with unknow websites as well
-------------------------
popup
ABP is one of the best popup blockers i have ever used. straight up. i can use it and click to play java, and i hardly ever EVER get popups, even on shady websites that are nothing BUT popups. Every time i start a new pc or have to reinstall chrome, first thing i do is add ABP.
-------------------------
popup
I have both ABP & the regular AB.  I truly have never been bothered with pop-ups and I have had it for as long as it has been offered.  Add AB and see if that helps.

Great product, I used to have a lot of ads that kept lagging up my computer. Popups and other ads have been greatly reduced! I rated 4 stars because it won't stop all window pop ups, but is a great add on!!

Blocks even the nastiest pop-ups, but doesn't interfere with site interaction. Even seems like it speeds up streaming by keeping all the side ads, videos and pop-ups from slowing down computer. Awesome Extension! I would pay for it.

This is amazing- I guess my computer had gotten a virus which kept causing all sorts of pop-ups- so I added Adblock Plus! It even blocks ads on Youtube which was awesome xD

This is a must-have for any Chrome user. Adblock plus get rid of ALL annoying pop-ups, new windows, and the many other annoyances that have become part and parcel of browsing today. I can finally browse in peace. :)

I use an old Toshiba laptop which has a single core Celeron CPU. Prior to installing ABP CPU would peg quite often over 90%. Norton would popup a message indicating high cpu usage warning.

ABP stopped that completely and Chrome is very responsive now.

Never had a problem with it. I love it. I hate ads and popups. Great app and super easy to install!

I put it on both of my laptops as well as the laptops of my cousin and brother. This extension helps out a lot to avoid any potential issues with advertisements and pop-ups.
-------------------------
popup
THANK YOU SO MUCH. NOW I CAN GO TO TO WEB WITH OUT ALL THE POPUPS. THANK YOU AGAIN.   WHERE CAN I SEND MONEY.
-------------------------
popup
4 stars only because there are a few popups that it doesn't block. Rarely ever happens though. A must have for any avid Internet user.
-------------------------
popup
At first, the ABP works wonderfully. I could see the difference! Before, when I'm on Google Chrome, there would always be ads popping up - even when I accidentally clicked onto a black space! 

Then, when I installed this extension, the pop-ups lessen dramatically, and it doesn't take 2hrs for me to watch a series online.

But now, the ads comes back. I don't know if it's because the ABP has blocked too much ads to save anymore ads now or maybe its just a "30-day" trial or amazing ad-free that I don't know about and they never stated.
-------------------------
popup
this is fantastic, working nice, blocks most of the pop-ups counting in background.
-------------------------
popup
To be honest Adblock+ is one of the best free adds-ons that I ever used and I really can't believe I now can surf the web, open many websites without showing me the pop-up ads or the ads that appear everywhere...

Thanks guys and wish you all the good luck <3 <3

Adblock was working perfectly for me until a few days ago. Now all the annoying popups are back. The ones that take me to a web page and won't let me close it down without checking "yes." What's up?
-------------------------
popup
Works perfectly, with no problems... great tool for Internet casuals. Next step is adding hosts blocking to the PC and the Router (via DD-WRT).

If Miika Ahonen had viewed the .png in question, he'd see it's the adblock 'ads blocked' counter. If he stopped browsing the sites that were trying to rapidly pop-up ads, he wouldn't have that problem. You obviously did some work to find what your PC was doing, don't cry wolf on adblock.
-------------------------

I don't think I need to say this but i love this plugin. No more ads for music and video streaming for me. The app also does not give me annoying popups unlike other free alternatives I have used. And also there has yet to be an ad that gets past this plugin

Adblock Plus stopped working for me a few weeks ago. I have been getting pop-ups and regular ads all over the webpages that I visit, and Adblock seems unaware of their existence.

While it's great and a major convenience, a lot of pop-ups (New windows, banner ads) are making their way through.  Other than that it works, and best of all, it's FREE. Highly recommend everyone takes the 30 seconds to download it on their browser.

Good stuff - ESPECIALLY for watching sports and other TV programs that you cannot get in your part of the world (such as NFL football in SouthEast Asia) - blocks annoying AND SOMETIMES DANGEROUS pop-ups nicely!!

Perfect for any browsing.  Keep an eye on it when you're experiencing website problems though, it may be protecting you from popups you're attempting to produce.  Simply allow that site through the block temporarily (or permanently!) and you're golden.  I'd recommend this anyone.

I love AdBlock Plus! I had it on Firefox and it was great at keeping 95% of the pop-ups at bay, and 100% keeping stupid sidebar ads on facebook and yahoo away. I was hoping they made an extension for chrome when I made the switch, imagine my delight! :) I fully endorse AdBlock Plus!

*UPDATE* I still love ABP, but on facebook, it only intermittently blocks the sponsored ads :/ Hopefully, they find a permanent fix to this.

I love this program.  Popup ads are one of the most annoying things on the Internet.  They stop you from seeing things, randomly start blasting annoying videos while you are working, and slow down page loading.  As an added bonus, it stops those ads at the beginning of YouTube videos.  It has a few glitches on certain sites, but generally a great program.

Glad to see Adblock Plus  on Chrome. Now im waiting for Adblock Plus Pop-up Addon to be added. When this happens i can finally switch from Firefox to Chrome. Chrome is much better then Firefox, but i use Firefox only for this amazing add-ons.

This is one of my favourite extensions in the Google Chrome store.

It works like a charm, especially after adding extra subscriptions.  

Website s are now a pleasure to read and I can actually follow the flow of the content. I especially like the complete absence of popups and other Flash nonsense.

The only feature I miss from the Firefox version is the "disable for this site" option on the button that automatically adds the current site to the whitelist.

All-in-all, I love the extension and keep up the good work!

EASILY the best ad-blocker I've ever found. Wanna block a specific element you don't like on a page? The feature to do so is readily available, just a few clicks, then bam, you have access to block anything possible. Wanna stop ad-blocking because you want to give a few cents to a kind stranger? Done, with nothing but a click within the menu. I definitely recommend getting it, because it not only works incredibly well, but others have mentioned how they've been using it for years without a problem in other reviews, and I've found proof of that firsthand. Not a single ad, no weirdness, nothing; it's genuinely near flawless. Easiest 10/10 of my LIFE.

Edit: yeah, I was right, I just didn't know how right I was. For any who somehow stumble across this review, if you have something like those premium subscription pop-ups that sometimes slip through, you can block those as well using the built-in feature. Just click the block option in the menu that pops up when you click on the extension next to the search bar at the top, and hover over what you want to block, then move the mouse around the general area until it highlights the full part of what you want to block, including its background. If you're having trouble going back to the normal page and you have been blocked from interacting with it, then you can open a new tab (or duplicate it), reload your current one, or press the back button. There's also an option to un-block something in the settings if you wish to do so, although you can just fully disable ad blocking for the specific page you're on within that same menu that you used earlier.

it does what it says it will and it does it rather well in my opinion and at no cost to me so five star from me! 10/10 I definitely recommend though I will say while it does block ads some websites have software to see if you are using an adblocker and will stop you from using it till you deactivate the ad blocker not to criticize adblock it's free and does as promised.

its great the only reason i didn't give it a full five is the fact that it doesn't stop pop ups from sliding in on some sites

This app works great. I like the way you can turn off blocking for just one page. Sites to block are continually  updated within the app. The allow site feature get automatically populated when you turn off blocking to a particular site or page and the list is easy find in settings if you need to change or remove a site. Advanced features include the ability to create your own or import custom access or blocking filters/lists. You can even force an update to or edit the built in filters/lists

I have a couple of macbook pros.
i learned not to do updates for safari, because it removed my adblock plus and i could never use it again... i have mojave on one, am not going to update it, and adblock plus is like God to me, living for two years with ads on youtube, now ad free completely...
i find every couple of weeks youtube or google comes out with a new bypass probably a trojan on a video i watch, but i found a way to stop all ads...
all you do is open the adblock plus icon on top of your screen, on CHROME, which I am using, NOT safari, it wont work on safari anymore... but on Chrome, when you install adblock plus, you get a red icon on top of screen. Click on the gear and open settings then on left go to Advanced, and then update your filter lists and you will stop all youtube ads...
ADBLOCK PLUS, i love you, saving me data way out in the bush using my phone... thank you guys you are tops...

Need a break from intrusive ads that keep harassing you no matter what you do? this extension made my live come back like a angel blessed me.

I was just about to quit YouTube due to all the ads. Someone online, who saw my complaint, suggested Adblock. I'm so grateful that he did. It's renewed my appreciation of videos. It works great. No ads interrupting the videos. Although it's free, they do take donations and every now and then I send a few bucks, it's worth it to me. They don't bug you after you've made a donation. I was worried about that. Anyway, it's a great extension.

This is one of the best Adblocker and Pop-up blocker in the chrome store. My school used it for 3 years and i have used it for 4 years. Eventually my school stopped it because they blocked the chrome web store lmao. But either way, this is one of the best adblocker! I am very satisfied with this.

Concentrating on technical content is challenging enough without the burden of ignoring deliberately distracting video clips and animations, which offer with no ability to stop. This tool gives me more cognitive resources which is the most precious thing that I possess. Thank You!

I have been using this blocker for as long as I can remember. It has done well for me. I always recommend it when asked about annoying ads. The one feature that I would like to see developed, That would really help this none tech. senior do better learning how to survive in cyber space. Is being able to  stop the popup on wants to know your location.

Useful light add-on that does not cause lag and allows many websites access ads-free. Loved the app. Should have some feature to prioritize add-ons. Sometimes chrome starts promptly without loading add-on and i have to refresh the page. Thank you developers.
-------------------------
stop
I was pretty skeptical since I've never used an ad blocker before and I wasn't exactly sure how it would even work. My intention was simply to get rid of the annoying pop-ups that would appear over youtube videos, but I had no idea that it would actually stop commercials from playing when watching any online video, as well! This is incredible! All I had to do was download and the ad-blocker just worked on it's own. I didn't even have to worry about downloading malware with it, like most online downloads. This is amazing!

error
i was having a problem with my youtube showing "error occured, pls try again. playback id: ...." and i was using "adblock for youtube" but it didnt work out of a sudden so i decided to give this a try after my sister's recommendation and it works rlly rlly well!! thank you!!

Used to work fantastic, until TODAY, whereby it began to block pages loading altogether, I removed it and voila everything loads fine now. It happened on MS Edge too.

Fantastic tool for speeding up the loading of pages, reduce ability for cross site tracking, and reduced ads!

Things got to the point where I could barely use my laptop. If I wanted to research something, it was quite painful with intrusive adds, screen refreshers, auto-play video vlips, terrible slow-downs to load the 30 rotating adds on either side of article I want to read. This prevented me from doing anything meaningful on the internet. Ad-Block Plus gave me back the internet. It is easy to use and once you set it up the way you want, there is very little maintenance. I have found news agencies are the quickest sites to slam notifications on your screen telling you to remove your ad-blocker, but I just go to a site that doesn't do that instead of adding them to the exclusions list. Ad-block Plus is a beautiful thing and makes the internet usable again! I have been using it for a couple years now and have added it to my phone and home pc as well.
-------------------------
stop
I use both this and "AdBlock" (which seems to be a different company, but is also free) simultaneously. They block a very different number of ads, but I don't know if that is because one gets to them first before the other, and then the ad isn't there to block anymore, or if they have different parameters for what constitutes an ad. Either way, between the two, I am very very happy. 

I ultimately had to disable ALL ads, since the very purpose for which I even installed these blockers was to keep my poor computer from overheating, which was happening all the time with the constant video ads playing. When I initially allowed "safe" ads (or whatever they called it) to stay, my computer was still being overworked. But ever since I turned off all ads (which I feel badly about, but WHY DO ALL ADS these days have to be freaking videos?!?!), my computer hasn't overheated once! üòÉ

My only suggestion/complaint (?) would be that these work a little bit more discreetly. I have had a lot of pages stop me on a landing page before entering to ask if I would please turn off my ad blocker. I wish they just didn't know about them! Not sure if this is a possibility, or not. 

Anyway, I am extremely pleased and grateful for this service, and I highly recommend this and AdBlock together.

Adblock Plus has been a lifesaver for me.  We live in a rural community and our only internet is our cell phone hotspot.  I don't get enough speed or bandwidth to manage lots of ads or streaming, and we nearly gave up on internet altogether because of that.  Adblock Plus has changed all this and allows us to have internet access without all the additional web noise.  THANK YOU!

All you have to do is set it and forget it. You can read articles uninterrupted, your content loads much faster, it protects you from false links/scamming/spamming/phishing/ID theft, this FREE app does so much.

This is by far the best ad blocker out there. Its simpler and easier to use than the other ones. While it doesn't block EVERY SINGLE AD on some pages it still offers a feature where you can manually block the element (blocking it from the code itself) so that any code like that in the elements tab wont show up on the page when you reload it. I would give 4 stars if it didn't have that feature. Overall though, Ad Blocker Plus works VERY WELL and makes load times faster than Firefox.

Reliable and fuss-free. Love the ability to toggle the extension for certain websites and target specific ads with a right-click. I use it almost all the time to block out potential security threats or just to speed up loading. I definitely recommend this over any other ad blocking extensions.

I will definitely NOT live without this extension.  This extension is God sent.  So easy to use and it stops those annoying ads just like it's suppose to.  It even stops ads before you play on online video games.  I love this extension.  It does what I want it to do.  If a website gets picky about you using it, just click on the ABP icon and tick disable for this site.  Then un-tick when your done.  Thank you so much for this.  One very grateful user :D  And note:  I noticed some people said it stopped working, not for me and I used it for around 3 years now.

Malware and advertisers are trying very hard to get around the ad blocker software. You might be a victim to what they are trying to do. I know because I started experiencing the same thing until I had my system cleaned! try having the Geek Squad or someone like them clean your system and you might not have any more problems with the software not working. Or else AdBlock Techs need to take a look at what is going on. I hope this helps. Because somehow these ads must stop where we don't want them! Peace! (=

I really love Adblock Plus!

It automatically blocks almost every advertisement, even the annoying popup ones on YT videos. It also makes pages load a lot faster on my outdated computer which is a huge plus.

One feature that I really like is being able to whitelist individual websites so AB+ won't block their ads. That gives me the ability to support websites that I like by allowing them to earn a little ad revenue from me. It also makes me feel like I have a lot more control over my privacy.
-------------------------

Been using Adblock Plus for years in all my devices and it never failed my expectations. I just want ABP to add a period of how long ABP be disabled on certain site because sometimes we need to disable ABP to correctly load a site but forgot to enable it again. Aside from it, ABP does a great job. Thanks!
-------------------------
break
Its always worked perfectly fine for me. And its nice to see Shannon Bell from the ABP support team is quick on the draw to shut down those 1 star crybabies. "Sold out rip adblock" gimme a break man. Its a free program so zip it or go elsewhere. Thank you Adblock for all the years of torture free web browsing.

After a few weeks, adblock plus stopped working. We do hope for the better service. Great app. Please keep going!

It does it's job and does it well. I do have some issues with sites which will block access if this is on, but that isn't an issue that can be fixed by this extension. And while it does miss a few ads every once in a while, it has been reliable and makes browsing the Internet much better.
-------------------------
stop
If you think ABP is your friend, better think again. ABP sleeps with the most annoying partners, and it take money from them, and you cannot stop the autoplay ads from their bed fellows.

ebay has been very slow for me lately, i was watching all these ad-server url's in the progress box, so i installed this app, Adblock Plus, left on default settings and now it blocks 18 elements on every ebay page refresh and it's MUCH faster loading the content ... THIS IS A GREAT APP !

Love it! The other adblock stopped working and went down.  This is a much better alternative!

I really liked this Adblock Plus extension. It works for almost all websites but now it is loosing the touch with some website adds(it seems like adds are getting smarter) I am going to try another add blocker for some times and will use this again for sure cause this worked for me for over an year. No hard feelings :D

NOTE: Back to this plugin again cause this plugin is the best app for youtube ads. Most other plugins remove youtube ads but the videos stop and start again where the ads suppose to play but this plugin play videos from start to end without any distractions. Cool..

I  seem to have disabled Adblock plus in error earlier.  The difference is notible.  I had forgotten how unpleasant and strange it is when adverts pop up.  This is an excellent app

I have been using adblock Puse version since I had read online that it blocked the unwanted ads and loads webpage faster and prevents malware and viruses from entering through various links which is great and best of all it is easy to use.

At one time this was an awesome extension. Never had a problem with it in several years of using it. It stopped blocking Ads several months ago. I now use the uBLOCK ORIGIN.

bug
Hey there! if you have any suggestions (https://adblockplus.org/en/contribute#suggest) for us we'd love to hear them or if you're seeing some bugs (https://adblockplus.org/en/bugs) please let us know!

I've used adblock for years and never had issues until now. The game site I'm hooked on now treats adblock like an enemy, & if we have it, we're forced to see only a black screen where the games USED to load-the games never load. My choice is to keep adblock and go find another game site! Let me also add that adblock plus works on EVERYTHING else perfectly!!

error
Easy to use.  It is great for blocking ads, especially ads that appear to be tech support and error messages.  Also helps large pages with huge numbers of ads load faster.  (I do sympathize with companies who provide news or tools for free, and I do disable Ad Blocker on those websites, for example newspaper websites, provided the ads are not excessive or confusing.  That is easy to do, just click on the ABP stopsign and deselect "Enabled on this site".)  To sum up, I've used ABP for years and I highly recommend it.

I like This extension. It makes my computer run faster while surfing the web by getting rid of the ads. Also the extension gets rid of ads when I'm playing games on the web and gets rid of the lag causing by the ads while I'm playing a game and reading an article online. In the meanwhile, if I'm scrolling down a page on a artical or playing a game, it lags for a couple of seconds (because of the the automatic reload of page for the ads), that causes to restart the level that I'm playing on or try to find where I left off on the artical that I'm reading on while scrolling down. Otherwise, I like it!
-------------------------

Great! I would give it 5 stars, but recently I have been seeing banners on some sites that, even when I use the Block Element feature to block them (it allows you to force an ad or banner to be removed by adding it or it's location on the page specifically to the block list), they pop back up instantly. What is unusual is that when they pop back up (when I have not reloaded or refreshed the web page yet) they show up in a different location on the page (the top left area) until I refresh the page and then they are back to where they were originally and unchanged.

BE ADVISED

Wonderful app, as other's have said it can make some sites slow to load.  My real beef thou is that the white list doesn't work, there are some sites that I both want and need to have the ads load but this refuses to allow them, which means I have to disable it

This app is amazing! Most reviews for other products are usually filled with fake reviews so I wasn't holding out much hope this app would be any better than the rest. But, I was willing to give it a try and was very pleased to see this one was actually the real deal. It is extremely rare now that anything gets past it. I visited a sight not long ago that attempted to use the rapid fire method of breaking through ABP but totally failed. I even watched the counter to see if it would make it and it finally gave up at 235 attempts in about 55 seconds. Give it a try and you'll see what I mean.

really happy with this programme, I have donated as we all should to stop adverts taking over!

Works great! Easy to turn off and on where adblocking limits access to content. Very robust in removing ads PLUS it allows one to kill items on pages that are irritating. It's also available from their website for android devices that are NOT rooted and it works great on those (have it on both my phone and tablet). Note that Google removed ABP for Android from the Play store because they cater to advertisers on Android -- bad act, Google.

Used this Extension for over 2 years and NEVER had an issue aside from me rolling back my PC yesterday and came to find for some reason i had to reinstall ABP along with Chrome itself due to an error; when i went to open chrome ABP was still installed but the statistics didnt show anything in the little icon window and it wasn't blocking any ads even when enabled on the current page. Still ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ definitely.

Works perfectly, with no problems... great tool for Internet casuals. Next step is adding hosts blocking to the PC and the Router (via DD-WRT).

If Miika Ahonen had viewed the .png in question, he'd see it's the adblock 'ads blocked' counter. If he stopped browsing the sites that were trying to rapidly pop-up ads, he wouldn't have that problem. You obviously did some work to find what your PC was doing, don't cry wolf on adblock.

Adblock Plus stopped working for me a few weeks ago. I have been getting pop-ups and regular ads all over the webpages that I visit, and Adblock seems unaware of their existence.

amazing for the first month until it just decided to stop working apparently without and sort of description so yea THANKS

This used to be good, but you must be signing deals with more advertising companies, because I have started to get a lot more adverts recently.  Facebook 'sponsored posts' (aka paid ads), youtube, google ads.  The whole point of using this was to get rid of ads, not to have to put up with adverts from companies that have given you a load of money to let them through.  If things don't change back, or at least let us get rid of the ones we don't want, then I am going to look for another ad blocker that is actually effective.

Couldn't live without it, since I simply CANNOT stand ads for those stupid "weight-loss" supplements which appear on every single website. Furthermore, it's pretty good about blocking those ads out there which, when loaded by your browser, install all sorts of nasty viruses and adware.

Best extension ever. Makes pages load and run smoother due to no ad scripts slowing the process. Love it.
-------------------------

If it stopped working, go into settings and add a filter.

Great app :)
-------------------------

So out of nowhere, this app stopped blocking items in Chrome. It was really frustrating. Through some poking around, I found out that the filter subscription section in ABP options was empty. I clicked on "Add Filter Subscriptions" and "EasyList" popped up and was enabled. Now everything is back to normal, and most items are being blocked. I think something happened with the last Chrome update that caused this to happen, but all is good now.
-------------------------
stop
WOW I can't believe how many ads have been blocked by this extension. Every time I go to a website, I keep seeing the amount of ads that have been blocked and I'm still shocked. I can cruise through the web without waiting anymore. Although I can't seem to stop ads on Hulu, I don't mind. But I feel like 99 percent of the time this thing works great! Even blocks the ads on facebook! WOW. I'm donating money to them right now. Thank you for the amazing service/ extension you've created. I really appreciate it!

Ive been using ABP for about 2 years now. I have grown to like this. It helps alot when you are gaming or for the anime lovers out there. I recommend this to anyone who is using the internet. When using chrome though, you have to becareful. it does after some time stop blocking ads. Why is this? Wish ABP would do a update to fix this though.
-------------------------
stop
i love ittt it saved my life i mena not really but it stops the lagg yesssssss

Was good for a very long time then today it randomly stopped working. Every site I went to ABP said it was blocking ads but it was not. I just re-installed it and it seems to be working fine now.

Ok for everybody else who noticed it stopped blocking youtube ads, uninstall and re-install it. I just did it, it worked for me IJS...

It worked amazingly before but now its stopped working. I really hope this gets fixed so we can continue loving this extension.
-------------------------

Works like a charm most of the time, some ads don't seem to be blocked, but for the most part it's reliable. It stops Video ads so if you spend long hours browsing Youtube like me you'll love this.
-------------------------

It keeps crashing, and when it does, I can't reload it, and have to re-download it only to hope that I won't have to do it again for at least a week. It's helpful when it doesn't suck balls.

Stopped blocking ads for me within the last few days, but i went into the options (from extensions page) and realized i needed to add a filter 'subscription' (Easylist) again. not sure why it went away, but for anybody confused about seeing ads, try this! BTW, adblock plus makes the internet a wonderful place, thanks so much for all your effort devs. ALL CREDIT GOES TO BRAD LORENZEN
-------------------------

It's very useful, although it stops working after a while and needs a reinstall. It's fine though, once you notice and ad that's not supposed to be there, you can just reinstall.
-------------------------

Was perfect until a few weeks ago when the back button stopped functioning on some sites unless I disable the extension.  Fix that and it'll be perfect again.
-------------------------

This app would be okay with five stars, but their seems to be a problem not with my computer but with the app, where it seems to have stopped working lately. No problems until then...

This is working fine, and I had the same problem as everyone else here. Perhaps the author of the program should note this: The filters were somehow disabled, whether by a crafty website or via update bug. Just go into the ABP settings and select to add filers. Choose the language filter that suits you and WALLA! it works perfectly again. I hope this helps.

For all those who experience the issue when ABP stops working, just uninstall the extension and re-install it.. then it should work fine

On lower-end machines, it does slow things down ever-so-slightly while loading, but aside from that, this is an absolute must have for both casual web surfers and people looking through specific sites.

This extension is fantastic, but when it has to be turned off for particular video players to load. The nice part is that it will only show one ad and it will then continue ad-free after that. 

I highly recommend this extension to anyone!

Blocks ads for youtube and when watching tv shows on various websites. It is very nice. It does not stop your browsing data from being recorded. If you ask it too block them, it does some. Ghostely does the rest for me. Between the two, you have a lot of control over what advertisement companies can do to and "for you."
-------------------------
stop
it had been working great even since I added it to my chrome, but recently stopped working and all the ads are just soooo annoying!! Please fix it and really appreciate it!
-------------------------
stop
Overall it does the job (after Adblock stopped working decently for me). Too bad, however, that it won't get rid of Google Ads...
-------------------------
stop
I used to like it.  One day my pictures on Facebook stopped loading unless I individually click on each one.  It didn't used to do that.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled.  Everything works fine without adblock except I now get all the ads.
-------------------------

I love this extension! My computer is slow so it takes twice as long to load a page if it's loaded with ads. But with this plugin it's much faster.
-------------------------
stop
Excellent add-on, makes the web useable again, and I like the it has an option to allow non-intrusive ads, I don't mind google ads for example, I just don't want large flashing "You've won" ads everywhere I go. For people saying it has stopped working, update your listings, and find some extra ones!
-------------------------
stop
Amazing, However i can't help but notice the "Suggested video" still comes up at the beginning of YT and i can't find a filter to stop it
-------------------------
stop
Recently stopped blocking Youtube advertisements. I hope that this is fixed soon. Otherwise it has worked wonders.
-------------------------
stop
Yes, it has recently stopped working for me as well(Chrome). It did work for a very long time. It seems like it's an issue with the plugin, as not only YouTube ads are showing, but Twitch ads are also showing again.

Before that, it was very good. Hopefully they will fix soon.
-------------------------
stop
It stopped working, but I got it fixed. 1. Unable it. 2. Enable it. 3. Check off 'Allow some non-intrusive advertising '(which Google somehow sneaked that in there...). But I was watching YouTube, then I saw ads, and I was wait a minute! But I fixed it, and now it's fine for me ^__^
-------------------------
stop
Was working until today.  Doesn't stop anything on Youtube.  Please fix!
-------------------------

Used to love adblock, it was perfect. Since a couple of weeks (as far as I know) they are accepting payment from google to allow (ie not block)  "Ad related to" at the top of Google search results. There is no indication whatsoever where sponsored search results end and genuine search results begin. My biggest gripe in months and a waste of good time, since sponsored links usually aren't what I am looking for.

If an adblock alternative stops bye I will start using it.
-------------------------
stop
it works just fine reinstall it if the ads stop blocking
-------------------------

Sometime it stops working so I have to reinstall, but otherwise amazing.

If you download this for the sole purpose it removes Pandora ads, it's worth your time.  I was on ESPN's website looking at Xgames crashes and forced to watch the same stupid 30sec clip before every video when I started looking for a way to stop it.  This works and is probably my favorite Chrome ad on.

It works very well.

Does anyone else notice the initial loading of it when opening a new chrome browser, it takes forever for adblock to load.

chrome browser status bar just hangs for a couple minutes saying loading adblock...

works perfect after it loads though

Good except for it breaks a few sites.

I love this program.  Popup ads are one of the most annoying things on the Internet.  They stop you from seeing things, randomly start blasting annoying videos while you are working, and slow down page loading.  As an added bonus, it stops those ads at the beginning of YouTube videos.  It has a few glitches on certain sites, but generally a great program.

was good until it stopped blocking certain ads. certain websites have a video ad that adblock doesn't filter. otherwise good app.

Adblock Plus is a fantastic tool and add-on for Firefox, it allows you to block internet ads, block un-wanted images, which generally speeds up loading time on websites. 
It's easy to configure and has a set list of known ad suppliers to block so you don't have to input anything.

Best adblock in Town !! Removes every add visible and loads pages faster. If adds do pop up then just click the "Adblock Plus icon" in the omnibox and then click the "AD" on that page, the ad would no longer appear and it's url entry will be made in the filter list (For future reference).......  
Haven't been pestered by  many adds since I've started using this addon (Past 1 year, on firefox and chrome). Thanks and keep up the good work :)

Been using this for a year or so and I absolutely love it.

Blocks all ads on many of the streaming sites I visit. Although it may occasionally miss an ad or two, all I have to do it disable the element and reload the page for the blocker to kick in.

I don't have a top notch PC but this does -not- slow chrome down on my dekstop OR laptop. I'm not quite sure why there are so complaints of this slowing people down... I haven't had any problems with it.

THIS is exactly what I've been looking for!! So far it works GREAT, and I'm loving the faster load times, and of course, no more annoying ads! I've encountered no bugs either, however like other reviewers mentioned, I do have to disable ABP when logging into certain google features, but since I rarely use those anyway, it's not a problem for me. Thanks for creating such a useful extension, I'm definitely recommending this one!

My God people stop complaining so much.  This is a great extension. No way its going to block 100% of the ads, the ad agencies will always find ways to bypass this.  Be greatful that it works well.  This extension is awesome, makes browsing the web so much better.

Easy to use, very user friendly. The only complaint to be had from me is the software sometimes times out before it can make a connection, causing the VPN to be shut down while running internet operations as you normally would. If you are not paying attention to the connection status every once in a while, you could be off VPN and not know it. But overall excellent VPN, I will continue to refer people to this product!

ABP got the blocks on lockdown. Extremely useful for Youtube specifically, no ads at all when viewing. That's really the extent of my use, but most other sights I'm not seeing ads on.
Also love that you can turn it on and off pretty fast. Needed to once and it wasn't confusing.

Is the best adblocker I've used, it works perfectly and when certain sites demand you to turn it off you don't need to keep activating it again, and every time you access the website again it's still deactivated (sorry for bad English, It's my 2nd language and I'm still trying to learn how to write properly )

This app works great. I like the way you can turn off blocking for just one page. Sites to block are continually  updated within the app. The allow site feature get automatically populated when you turn off blocking to a particular site or page and the list is easy find in settings if you need to change or remove a site. Advanced features include the ability to create your own or import custom access or blocking filters/lists. You can even force an update to or edit the built in filters/lists
-------------------------

Idea: Maybe add a feature where when websites detect an adblocker and tell you to turn it off. Maybe add a feature where those websites cant detect it? Just a suggestion, if you like it contact me at, Ultimateflexer123456@gmail.com THANKS love it btw

Good adblocker, reliable, but i notice that if i turn off my pc/laptop/chromebook and my chrome has auto recover or restore the tabs thing, and the tab i was on is a youtube vid, ads appear unless i open a new youtube tab. overall good adblocker!

Great free ad blocker when used properly. Once in awhile there are minor issues like it turning off (probably caused by an update - it's own or another that interfered with it somehow) or ads showing again on some websites but nothing a remove and reinstall won't fix.

Awesome extension that cut down on a lot of unnecessary ads... can also choose to have ads or no ads at all by turning off the ad blocker and refreshing the page.

Agreeing with the most Recent comments (please filter reviews and read them in that order, because older reviews are not correct any more.) This ABP is now more efficient, has added features, and works very well!

I love that it has the block-element feature too, for any kind of specific page element or image you don't want to see :)

There's nothing I currently feel is missing. All I know is when I turn it off, I see how much I'm NOT missing! :)

May I ask the dev's a question? Does this actually block/skip ads in Spotify Free? Because a friend of mine gets no ads there now. Even if it doesn't, that's not a problem, just curious!

Thank you for this great extension!

This has gone above and beyond my expectations. I originally starting using it to just block ads when doing schoolwork, but now I rarely turn it off.
-------------------------

This works. Like definitely works. I've been using it for a while, and I've only seen one ad. In any case where you see one just report it, it's not that hard. Also make sure you have 'Acceptable Ads' off. And of course, an ad will find a way through, which is why all ad blockers have to update. I don't know why people are having speed problems because Chrome's speed has been completely fine for me. It's a great ad blocker, and i'd recommend it. (‚úø‚ó°‚Äø‚ó°)

I've been using this extension for around 3 or 4 years now, and it has worked amazingly! Of course, there are some times when the extension needs to be turned off because the acceptable ads policy isn't on a specific website, but that rarely ever happens.

Works better than I ever thought that it would.  I've used Adblock Plus for years now on several different computers/laptops, and its performance has amazed me. it has out performed other ad blockers by far.  I have no complaints at all.  To top it off, it's FREE!

I really like this. Easy adblocker to use, easy to add custom filters, easy to turn on and off. I'm sure there are more sophisticated adblockers out there (adblock plus does have a tendency to block hyperlinks that try to open the link in a new window or tab) but this does everything I need it to do.
-------------------------
off
I use both this and "AdBlock" (which seems to be a different company, but is also free) simultaneously. They block a very different number of ads, but I don't know if that is because one gets to them first before the other, and then the ad isn't there to block anymore, or if they have different parameters for what constitutes an ad. Either way, between the two, I am very very happy. 

I ultimately had to disable ALL ads, since the very purpose for which I even installed these blockers was to keep my poor computer from overheating, which was happening all the time with the constant video ads playing. When I initially allowed "safe" ads (or whatever they called it) to stay, my computer was still being overworked. But ever since I turned off all ads (which I feel badly about, but WHY DO ALL ADS these days have to be freaking videos?!?!), my computer hasn't overheated once! üòÉ

My only suggestion/complaint (?) would be that these work a little bit more discreetly. I have had a lot of pages stop me on a landing page before entering to ask if I would please turn off my ad blocker. I wish they just didn't know about them! Not sure if this is a possibility, or not. 

Anyway, I am extremely pleased and grateful for this service, and I highly recommend this and AdBlock together.

This is by far the best ad blocker out there. Its simpler and easier to use than the other ones. While it doesn't block EVERY SINGLE AD on some pages it still offers a feature where you can manually block the element (blocking it from the code itself) so that any code like that in the elements tab wont show up on the page when you reload it. I would give 4 stars if it didn't have that feature. Overall though, Ad Blocker Plus works VERY WELL and makes load times faster than Firefox.

We're not fake at all, Sumith, we promise! You might still be seeing ads because of our acceptable ads program, which you can read more about here - https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads.

I like This extension. It makes my computer run faster while surfing the web by getting rid of the ads. Also the extension gets rid of ads when I'm playing games on the web and gets rid of the lag causing by the ads while I'm playing a game and reading an article online. In the meanwhile, if I'm scrolling down a page on a artical or playing a game, it lags for a couple of seconds (because of the the automatic reload of page for the ads), that causes to restart the level that I'm playing on or try to find where I left off on the artical that I'm reading on while scrolling down. Otherwise, I like it!

It's a great tool. Easy to turn off, easy to customize what should get blocked. Simple interface, although the pseudo-regex (using wildcards) pattern you need to use to add to the blocked list is a little tricky... still, it never crashes and doesn't slow down Chrome!

It's great overall, blocks most annoying ads.. problem is that it blocks "flag counter" and isnt much powerful against "bad" type of tracking services. Overall good app, been using it for a long time and dont plan to get off.

Works great! Easy to turn off and on where adblocking limits access to content. Very robust in removing ads PLUS it allows one to kill items on pages that are irritating. It's also available from their website for android devices that are NOT rooted and it works great on those (have it on both my phone and tablet). Note that Google removed ABP for Android from the Play store because they cater to advertisers on Android -- bad act, Google.

Used to love this app. I'm guessing they sold out to an ad company as it now injects an ad into every site it can. The ad consists of "**** is a feature of ***** and uses visual search technology to find you relevant and related..."

I turned off every plugin I have one at a time to determine which one was the culprit. Adblock plus was it.

Watching streaming video on YouTube and other Internet sites is enjoyable again.  It is great to zoom past all 2:30 minutes of commercials that used to pop up while watching my favorite shows.  I just watch the clicker tick off the number of blocked ads as it fast forwards through them in seconds.

Excellent but it does fail sometimes to block some ads on some pages. I think, the app may try the cloud computing technology to collect urls or provide provisions to send urls to be added to a global list where other users can benefit from it. But that's ok as we have the manual blocking system of ads by adding our own filters. Thank you for taking care of our privacy on the web and peace of mind from annoying ads.

If google is making a work around to get past this app and show us ads, we have other options too ;) So, I don't think google will risk doing that.

Why do the majority of the adds on their new accepted list have google in the urls? Did Google buy them?

I only just realised the other day when I decided to turn this off how much it has changed my web experience.

It works great pretty much EVERYWHERE except Livestream and Facebook. It prevents me from seeing a Livestream so I have to turn it off on Livestream and go through video ads. No big deal really.

But Facebook ads are an issue. I notice a lot of them are coming through. That needs to be fixed. Otherwise, awesome extension. Haven't seen an annoying ad anywhere (except Facebook and Livestream) in a long time. It's especially awesome on YouTube.

Nice and easy to use.
Thanks to that surfing on the web is way more how it supposed to be!

It is great when it works. But I notice that the ads reappear when the browser is left open for a while. The ABP icon is still lite, meaning it is not disabled. Manually disable and reenable ABP removes the ads, but not for long.

I hadn't had much of a problem with ads until recently.  I'm not sure why but ads started blocking just half of an article I was reading from a legitimate site. One of the features I like best about AdBlock Plus is that it will allow you to list the sites you like and it won't block them. Prior to buying AdBlock Plus, I had subscrrbed to a much more expensive blocking service that would do the same but it was a much more involved process. With AdBlock Pus, it's so easy.

I tried AdBlock first and liked it sii I switched to AdBlock Plus for its added benefits.  I think it's nice to  buy a service like AdBlock Plus that allows you to contribute the amount of money you think it's worth, without charging you a set amount. I figure I got added benefits that AdBlock didn't have and I'm helping the company to keep the free site available for others, while I get added features.  I really love AdBlock Plus and I highly recommend it to others!

I have used this for two years at least.  Does what is says it will.  Development is consistent and frequent.  Occasionally there is a CPU hit, it gets resolved.  Very rarely there is an ad it does not catch, when reported and then blocked it usually solves this. Whitelisting sites or just pages is easy.  Thanks ABP!

This app works great. I like the way you can turn off blocking for just one page. Sites to block are continually  updated within the app. The allow site feature get automatically populated when you turn off blocking to a particular site or page and the list is easy find in settings if you need to change or remove a site. Advanced features include the ability to create your own or import custom access or blocking filters/lists. You can even force an update to or edit the built in filters/lists

Agreeing with the most Recent comments (please filter reviews and read them in that order, because older reviews are not correct any more.) This ABP is now more efficient, has added features, and works very well!

I love that it has the block-element feature too, for any kind of specific page element or image you don't want to see :)

There's nothing I currently feel is missing. All I know is when I turn it off, I see how much I'm NOT missing! :)

May I ask the dev's a question? Does this actually block/skip ads in Spotify Free? Because a friend of mine gets no ads there now. Even if it doesn't, that's not a problem, just curious!

Thank you for this great extension!

I like adblock plus - it blocks most ads from most sites most of the times, rarely crashes or glitches, and I know they do update it relatively often. Might try the mobile version soon. I would be glad to see Adblock Plus claim their Trustpilot Review Profile as I know that that's something I look to when I'm downloading new software/extensions/etc. Some people have suggested that the extension mines cryptocurrency in the background on your computer or adds its own malware, but I certainly haven't come across anything that would indicate that. I like the fact that I can whitelist pages - unfortunately, there are many websites that do not allow you to browse without enabling ads, but on the most part it's fine - it would be useful to have a temporary whitelist, so you can browse a page but it's not stored as whitelisted unless you go for a permanent whitelist type thing. Overall, I feel that Adblock Plus does a good job and doesn't cause me issues, and I know it's been recommended widely by some of the privacy/tech blogs I go on to in the past. However, having seen the trustpilot page and some of the other reviews here, I think I will do a bit more research now to check it's still the best option for me.

I have a couple of macbook pros.
i learned not to do updates for safari, because it removed my adblock plus and i could never use it again... i have mojave on one, am not going to update it, and adblock plus is like God to me, living for two years with ads on youtube, now ad free completely...
i find every couple of weeks youtube or google comes out with a new bypass probably a trojan on a video i watch, but i found a way to stop all ads...
all you do is open the adblock plus icon on top of your screen, on CHROME, which I am using, NOT safari, it wont work on safari anymore... but on Chrome, when you install adblock plus, you get a red icon on top of screen. Click on the gear and open settings then on left go to Advanced, and then update your filter lists and you will stop all youtube ads...

Things got to the point where I could barely use my laptop. If I wanted to research something, it was quite painful with intrusive adds, screen refreshers, auto-play video vlips, terrible slow-downs to load the 30 rotating adds on either side of article I want to read. This prevented me from doing anything meaningful on the internet. Ad-Block Plus gave me back the internet. It is easy to use and once you set it up the way you want, there is very little maintenance. I have found news agencies are the quickest sites to slam notifications on your screen telling you to remove your ad-blocker, but I just go to a site that doesn't do that instead of adding them to the exclusions list. Ad-block Plus is a beautiful thing and makes the internet usable again! I have been using it for a couple years now and have added it to my phone and home pc as well.

I really like this. Easy adblocker to use, easy to add custom filters, easy to turn on and off.

You need to look into Face Book (Fluff Buster) Purity - find it on FB and follow the instructions for use on the system you use (Windows, Mac).  It works great at keeping things in check on FB, and allows you to customize settings in FB. Between this program, and FBP (Facebook Purity), I find myself well covered for my needs.  (I can even set it to see who unfriended me, whitelist my friends so I can see their activity vs. what FB wants me to see).  Love it.

Worked good, keyword, worked*. Now it doesn't filter out pretty much anything i try to manually block. Auto play videos pop up, ads that sneak through are unable to be blocked. Might want to step up the game to keep the pace with the scumbag ad agencies...

Not sure if you've found a replacement by now, but my recommendation has always been ublock origin (make sure it has origin in its name). It's simply the best blocker out there, hands down. Never experienced a single issue, not once, and it blocks absolutely everything. While at the same time giving you total control of exactly what, when, & where to block, if you choose to do so (optional, it works fine default). It's also the lightest on resources, speeding everything up instead of bogging it down. You can also add/enable/check additional filter lists in its settings. There's even one (or a few) that gets rid of all those annoying "disable adblocker" messages you were referring to.
-------------------------

Hands down, this is currently the best adblocking extension. It literally blocks every ad possible. I saw many people complaining about Google ads, what they need to is visit the settings page ones and disable the options for those. After doing that make sure to update your lists. It'll work perfectly fine.

I really love Adblock Plus!

It automatically blocks almost every advertisement, even the annoying popup ones on YT videos. It also makes pages load a lot faster on my outdated computer which is a huge plus.

One feature that I really like is being able to whitelist individual websites so AB+ won't block their ads. That gives me the ability to support websites that I like by allowing them to earn a little ad revenue from me. It also makes me feel like I have a lot more control over my privacy.

Adblock Plus helped me to prevent the abnormal spike (over 90%) in CPUs core temperatures that occurred upon visiting websites containing poorly coded, CPU-hogging Flash-content, be they ads or non-ads. In addition, Adblock Plus helped with taking out all the notoriously obtrusive, non-Flash Ads in some of the news-websites which offer useful content, but are bad at keeping users' interests above their clueless Ad-Sales Team's interests and their Advertisers' interests.

Moreover, allowing users to whitelist content (ads or non-ads) is the most useful feature. It may require a learning-curve for many folks, but if one can figure out the way to manage that, it offers increased value.

I highly recommend Adblock Plus to every one who desires a rewarding user-experience while making meaningful use of the Web.

Thank you Team EyeO for this great work. May the Force be with you!

This is a great plugin. I am guessing all the 1-star reviews are from morons, or people hired by a competing product.  I love Adblock Plus.  Over 10 million users does not scream 1-star product to me.  I accidentally installed AdBlock on one of my computers instead of Adblock Plus and was shocked at how many ads it failed to block.  Installed Adblock Plus instead and POOF, back to normal.  I have given multiple donations to the developer.  I appreciate that you have the option of getting down into the base level of being able to write your own filters if you need to.

Great! I would give it 5 stars, but recently I have been seeing banners on some sites that, even when I use the Block Element feature to block them (it allows you to force an ad or banner to be removed by adding it or it's location on the page specifically to the block list), they pop back up instantly. What is unusual is that when they pop back up (when I have not reloaded or refreshed the web page yet) they show up in a different location on the page (the top left area) until I refresh the page and then they are back to where they were originally and unchanged.

I have been using this version of Adblock for a couple of years now.  Ninety-nine percent of the time I absolutely love it.  

The only time I have an issue with it is when I am trying to watch something on one of the major network sites, such as CBS, and the ads are no longer being blocked.  I find I need to go look and see what new filter syntax might be needed because CBS (or other site) keeps catching on and changing things.  I would hope that any new filter would be included with the updated lists but it never seems to.

Other than that little bump, I love this extension so much that I tell everyone I come in contact with all about it if they don't already know.

So out of nowhere, this app stopped blocking items in Chrome. It was really frustrating. Through some poking around, I found out that the filter subscription section in ABP options was empty. I clicked on "Add Filter Subscriptions" and "EasyList" popped up and was enabled. Now everything is back to normal, and most items are being blocked. I think something happened with the last Chrome update that caused this to happen, but all is good now.
-------------------------
list
When it works, this is a fantastic program. The problem is that it keeps removing the lists, and the only way to add them back in is to uninstall/reinstall the software (the "Add list" section doesn't work).
-------------------------
list
Excellent extension and I really like the (opt-out) exception made for non-intrusive adverts. My only complaint would be that the firstrun screen has useful configuration options which don't appear in the main program options.

Even more useful would be a way to see how many items were blocked by each list, thus allowing you to eliminate lists which weren't pulling their weight.
-------------------------
whitelist
Like Joe Papp, I don't like the choice you've made to move the Icon outside of the addressbar.

Please could you move it back OR Implement an Option so users can choose.

I've also been unable to whitelist specific URLs, I am only able to whitelist the whole website and Not certain pages.

Actual use:

WONDERFUL. I've tried using No Adblock for a week and there are some Ads that get on more nerve! (Giant Flash ones etc on Normal Websites).

This solves it for me.
-------------------------
filter
Awesome.  Makes the Internet tolerable.  Works on almost all ads.  However, Youtube and others are now embedding ads into their content which makes it harder to remove.  You will need to create custom filters and see if this successfully removes them for you.
-------------------------
whitelist
easy to use and not too complicated to configure either.
it would be great if you could add a new feature, to right click the icon in the address bar, and select add domain to whitelist. I use this feature often.

Stopped blocking ads for me within the last few days, but i went into the options (from extensions page) and realized i needed to add a filter 'subscription' (Easylist) again. not sure why it went away, but for anybody confused about seeing ads, try this! BTW, adblock plus makes the internet a wonderful place, thanks so much for all your effort devs. ALL CREDIT GOES TO BRAD LORENZEN
-------------------------
filter
HERE'S HOW TO ENABLE IT: 1. Go to Chrome's "Settings"
2. Go to "Extensions"
3. Next to Adblock Plus, click the "Options" link.
4. On the "Filter lists" page, click "+ Add Filter Subscription"
5. Choose one, like "EasyList (English)"
6. Click "+ Add" button.
7. After it's added, close Google Chrome.
8. YOU NOW HAVE ADBLOCK PLUS WORKING!!! You need to be subscribed to one of these filter subscriptions so ABP knows what is an Ad, and what isn't, in order to work! Simple! :) You're Welcome!
-------------------------
filter
This is working fine, and I had the same problem as everyone else here. Perhaps the author of the program should note this: The filters were somehow disabled, whether by a crafty website or via update bug. Just go into the ABP settings and select to add filers. Choose the language filter that suits you and WALLA! it works perfectly again. I hope this helps.

Was using this for almost 8 months now without any problems but Now it seems it is no longer blocking ads; they are filtering through on websites. Kindly look into it and do the needful
-------------------------
filter
Excellent app used on my laptop and android. Sometimes websites get cheeky and sneak through ads but this is by far the best out there. If, for some reason, ads do come through it's always just been a case of double-checking the settings and making sure an active filter is in use. Apart from that odd hiccup, awesome!
-------------------------
filter
I have had this extension for a few months and I completely love it. It is a MUST! However, just recently I noticed that some google ads started to pass through. I searched for a solution and found that you have to add easylist as a filter in the extension's settings. Afterwards it works perfectly again.
-------------------------
list
Excellent add-on, makes the web useable again, and I like the it has an option to allow non-intrusive ads, I don't mind google ads for example, I just don't want large flashing "You've won" ads everywhere I go. For people saying it has stopped working, update your listings, and find some extra ones!
-------------------------
whitelist
Love this extension! I have whitelisted YouTube, but I heard they are going to be adding a feature where YT channels can be whitelisted. Can't wait for that to happen so I can support my favorite content creators!
-------------------------
filter
Amazing, However i can't help but notice the "Suggested video" still comes up at the beginning of YT and i can't find a filter to stop it
-------------------------
list
I've been using this add-on for years, I love it. I couldn't imaging browsing the web without it. Truly makes my browsing experience much more enjoyable. Also, if you're having problems with it not blocking some  things you need to manually update your block lists.
-------------------------
list
5 star extension now! It works well and I can add my own custom filters/create my own personalized list, if EasyList + Annoyances + Privacy + Fanboy's ULTIMATE & COMPLETE aren't good enough! *scoffs* LOVED IT FOR FIREFOX AND LOVING IT FOR CHROME and better than IE9/ie10's current versions (a bit buggy-ie10), but haven't had any issues, with this extension acting up, or crashing. SO FAR SO GOOD! A SPECIAL THANKS TO THE DEV! YOU ROCK! THANKS! ~S~

after reading that they accept payoffs from companies to be whitelisted in the extension i've removed it and moved on!

Does what it's supposed to do and you can create your own filters for other stuff that annoys you.

Best ad blocker ever!

And to the people that say it doesn't block some ads, if you click on the ABP icon you can click and add it to the filter and BAM that ad doesn't show again
-------------------------
filter
Generally awesome app, though, it looks like FB has just figured out how to bypass the filters again. :(
-------------------------
filter
Excellent but it does fail sometimes to block some ads on some pages. I think, the app may try the cloud computing technology to collect urls or provide provisions to send urls to be added to a global list where other users can benefit from it. But that's ok as we have the manual blocking system of ads by adding our own filters. Thank you for taking care of our privacy on the web and peace of mind from annoying ads.

If google is making a work around to get past this app and show us ads, we have other options too ;) So, I don't think google will risk doing that.
-------------------------
filter
You should care to choice the proper filter list in the option that will give the best pageview

This thing is the bomb! I HATE Youtube ads, and this app filters them and all other 'Net ads. KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK!

If it wasn't for this specific extension, I wouldn't be using Chrome. The copycats I now see listed here don't come close.

While Firefox has better methods of making things like this work, this does as good a job as anything can for Chrome right now. Thanks for the great work!
-------------------------

This extension has been working perfectly for me. I especially enjoy the easy to use "easy create filter."

This is my favorite adblocker and I've tried a lot for Chrome that is currently available. 5 Stars! Thanks!!!
-------------------------
filter
5 Stars, awesome extension. Blocks any ads   that I wanted to block, or the already specified filters that you guys made. I made my own filters but never released them to the public, because I felt the need they needed more  ads to be blocked. 

This is really good if you can't find a way to block ads, but I think you should add a survey remover to this. It might be nice for everyone to see a survey remover that works :) .

Pretty good plugin, I'm hoping that you took my suggestions.

Thanks,

was good until it stopped blocking certain ads. certain websites have a video ad that adblock doesn't filter. otherwise good app.

I hate ads so much. If I had any intentions of buying anything I would go seek out the product myself. I don't need to be reminded every 2 songs(pandora) to go premium, I'm sure as hell not going to buy a car anytime soon(youtube), I don't need any genital enlarging formulas(random ads on websites), XD the list goes on! I love this extention. It will stay on my computer until the day it crashes haha. <3

Still doesn't block Facebook ads, even if you add filters manually.

Adblock Plus is a fantastic tool and add-on for Firefox, it allows you to block internet ads, block un-wanted images, which generally speeds up loading time on websites. 
It's easy to configure and has a set list of known ad suppliers to block so you don't have to input anything.
-------------------------
list
This extension works great!  For the people seeing ads after an update, or ads on certain websites, make sure your list subscriptions are checked!  I use both "Fanboy's adblock list" and "Easylist" and never see ads on any site.
-------------------------
filter
Gives you control to block/unblock anything, also if there are tiny adds getting through just un-tick the box saying: "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" And make sure you have both lists:
EasyList
And if you want/need (your personal choice):
Fanboy's Adblock List

You can do this by clicking "Add filter subscription" make sure you get the English ones though, or any other language you want/need.
Highly recommend this extension! Don't get the Chrome Adblock!!! They track you, this doesn't!
-------------------------
list
Why do the majority of the adds on their new accepted list have google in the urls? Did Google buy them? They claim only 25 percent want completely adfree browsing, but where do they get off taking away the option for everyone? NORMAL ADBLOCK IS BETTER! THEY DONT FORCE YOUR HAND ON ANYTHING! It works just as well too. I hope this helps someone.
-------------------------

Love this extension - though now it blocks Adsense even though I whitelisted it.

Works great is fast and non-intrusive(well that's the point).The interface works like you'd expect.
I like the new feature of allowing acceptable adds.  This will hopefully lead to more and more companies prioritising ads that will make the whitelist!

Ads keep many websites free. I strongly recommend you don't block ads, or at least white-list the majority of your frequented sites.

Love Adblock Plus on Firefox, love it on Chrome. Easy to set up, powerful filters, what more could you ask for?

Best adblock in Town !! Removes every add visible and loads pages faster. If adds do pop up then just click the "Adblock Plus icon" in the omnibox and then click the "AD" on that page, the ad would no longer appear and it's url entry will be made in the filter list (For future reference).......  
Haven't been pestered by  many adds since I've started using this addon (Past 1 year, on firefox and chrome). Thanks and keep up the good work :)

Just today it started blocking Google Plus from loading at all. Something to do with the redirect structure. For now I have added it to the whitelist and that seems to help, but hope the developers are paying attention to this issue!

Best extension ever. It really improves my browsing experience, I hate ads! And it's so helpful, because it's not just for ads. The easy filter is amazing, I've removed so many elements from several websites, everything looks so much cleaner.
-------------------------

Great extension. Personally it's easier to configure than the other version of Adblock to, which is nice. For those of you having issues with Ad's coming through the blocker, try going into the options and adding the Fanboys List if you don't already have it. After I did adverts everywhere vanished. Great add on!
-------------------------

Would like to say I have had adblock and ABP installed. It made my pc very slow, very loud but all ads were blocked.

I decided to get rid of just ADBLOCK...my pc no longer makes loud noises. the ram has dropped from 1.8 to 1.25gb maximum and I feel very happy :) please download ABP over AB...they both use the same filters for blocking ads the extensions DO NOT block ads ... the filters do...

The best. Especially the easy to manage custom block list. just point and click on the ad you want to disable! 
well done.

Does not get every single ad on the internet and it lately is letting all ads through. This extension is nice and VERY fast when it's compared to other adblock extensions.

Fix the recent issue of all ads getting through, and try to make it easier to block ads on a page using the "Easy create filter" option.
-------------------------

Great app!
When do you think it will be out of beta ?

The lists aren't updated automatically.

I have found this to be, BY FAR, the best ad blocker out there. I've never had an issue with it, the ability to add your own filters is simply fantastic, block certain things on websites from loading, it is so versatile and works brilliantly, i recommend it to everybody i know. Simply Brilliant.
-------------------------
list
Very good adblocker! The only thing I would recommend would be to add an option to autoupdate lists.
-------------------------

Been working marvellously for a year...recently (2 weeks ago?) ads started showing up...something definitely broke with an update. I need to go manually update the list everyday for the ads to not show up. Hope it will be fixed soon.
-------------------------
filter
I VERY rarely have to use the "Easy create filter feature," which is amazing. The only thing is, it works WAY better on my computer than my school's, probably because of the filters chosen.
-------------------------
whitelist
This is one of my favourite extensions in the Google Chrome store.

It works like a charm, especially after adding extra subscriptions.  

Website s are now a pleasure to read and I can actually follow the flow of the content. I especially like the complete absence of popups and other Flash nonsense.

The only feature I miss from the Firefox version is the "disable for this site" option on the button that automatically adds the current site to the whitelist.

All-in-all, I love the extension and keep up the good work!

Adblock plus, on default settings, only blocks "annoying ads'" numbnuts. use ur brain, go into adblock plus settings and press "Only allow ads without third-party tracking." Now u should have no more problems. Like geez people. Try doing something urself this time and not expecting some simple program to solve all of your problems. It's just a couple of ads' on youtube, you'll live.

It just works.

Used it for 2 years. Has never gotten in the way. Only does good things. There have only been a small number of websites that it hasn't blocked ads on, how ever the results are the same as a good DNS sinkhole config. The plugin is as good as it gets for client side ad-blocking.

This Ad blocker is amazing. Ad Block Plus has a couple of options in the settings to customize web page experience. Or you can just use the default setting, which works great for blocking unwanted and sometimes even harmful ads. I highly recommended.
-------------------------

Not sure if you've found a replacement by now, but my recommendation has always been ublock origin (make sure it has origin in its name). It's simply the best blocker out there, hands down. Never experienced a single issue, not once, and it blocks absolutely everything. While at the same time giving you total control of exactly what, when, & where to block, if you choose to do so (optional, it works fine default). It's also the lightest on resources, speeding everything up instead of bogging it down. You can also add/enable/check additional filter lists in its settings. There's even one (or a few) that gets rid of all those annoying "disable adblocker" messages you were referring to.

ebay has been very slow for me lately, i was watching all these ad-server url's in the progress box, so i installed this app, Adblock Plus, left on default settings and now it blocks 18 elements on every ebay page refresh and it's MUCH faster loading the content ... THIS IS A GREAT APP !

It's fantastic! Especially for the increasing number of adverts on YouTube and other such spammy sites.
HOWEVER it does, by default block all images on google photos, but that's Ok because you can disable the blocker for such situations.
You can also disable the blocker for sites you wish to support, like charities and freeware sites.
Keep up the good job!

Love the new changes, letting through proper ads if you want, and blocking dangerous and annoying ones. All it needs is YouTube, Twitch, Hitbox, and Wikipedia whitelisted by default and it'll be flawless! ^_^

great resource. my son adds it to my web browsers to keep spam adverts off my system and he even adds custom lists, for my personal prefs and it doesn't bog down my system!

GREAT EVEN FOR OLD LADIES! tested on an ASUS running Win 8.1 64-bit -touchscreen

5 STARS [smooth as silk now], and now that FanBoy's list has been added to EasyList it's 10 Stars!

note: supports international lists, so you can get comprehensive ad blocking coverage, in any region and if malwared? install the south pacific lists; especially CHINA!*

*they are why we need ad block by default and a script blocker/flash blocker. waiting on NoScript for Chrome! :D

SEE?! EVEN OLD LADIES CAN USE/INSTALL THIS! ;)

Essential for a pleasant web browsing experience and one of the first extensions you should install when starting with a fresh browser, the other one which comes to mind is Crumbs which protects your privacy.

Simply the best addon on the store, a literal life changer. You won't appreciate how much time & sanity it saves you until logging into a public or friend's PC later on and seeing all the repulsive, dehumanizing litter that are web ads. It isn't designed to block cookies and the like so if you want to go full in on blocking those an alternative browser altogether is your best bet. As for this, it's insane that it's both this effective and this free. They never intrusively ask but you can donate to them, highly recommend. Peace of mind is priceless
-------------------------
browser
I've tried out several ad blockers including my browser's built in adblocker but nothing beats AdblockPlus. It keeps adds, those pesky push notifications and irritating cookie warnings that take up half the article you're reading, away. Unfortunately, pop-ups DO get through and my virus guard start screaming. Other than that, it's an absolute treasure and I highly recommend ABP to anyone.

Great browser extension, extremely easy to set up upon first use using the settings that are web-based basically on a web page and to configure everything on the first run - thankfully when I bought a used Google Chromebook from Acer, once I sign into Gmail slash Google, Adblock Plus was pulled in from my I guess Windows 10 desktop PC and other places I was happy to not have to go download this again. It's a little confusing that there's an ad block I guess basic, and Adblock Plus, and I think there's an Adblock Pro which is maybe a subscription or annual payment model - hopefully this is not the freemium model or bait and switch Etc. Very pleased with configuring settings and letting be browser extension hideout in the background nice and quietly. Kudos 5 of 5 stars!

I installed ABP on my Chromebook sometime last year, and it did a dang good job at keeping ads away. Lately though, I tend to get pop-ups (which just open a new tab in my browser) whenever I click a link on a page I'm trying to browse. It's very irritating and some of these ads won't go away (I try to click "leave" and it just refreshes the page). What happened ABP?

One of the best extensions ever. Some ads may still pop up, but thanks to Adblock Plus, most are kept at bay, especially the spammy ones on social networking sites such as facebook. It also helps to improve the performance of your browser when playing games, as a lot of the ads that it blocks would have been using the same plug-in which games on the browser use, thus slowing down the game's functions. With this extension, your web games performance will be enhanced.

Praise the internet lords! I wish I knew HOW to download this years ago! I was mainly interested in getting rid of youtube adds, and it works instantly! I downloaded the Adblock Browser for my phone, and checked youtube and it works there too!
-------------------------
browser
Simply the best single add on to any browser, bar none! This plugin has improved my surfing experience tremendously. Love it!!
-------------------------
browser
It is AMAZING!!! I just wish I could use it in the Steam browser. :P
-------------------------
browser
I love this app! It does what it needs to do. I use Google Chrome as my only web browser if at all possibl and it blocks alla ads except some huluplus video ads and all YouTube video ads. I got a YouTube ad block and that worked perfectly, except it used the transparent video player instead of the regular YouTube player, which annoys me.
-------------------------
browser
Been using this for years and years - I won't use a web browser without it. Simply the best of all the copycat blockers.
-------------------------
browser
Amazing Application....i was so bothered by the ads appearing in my browsers thanks adblocker plus for such amazing app.
-------------------------
browser
"It's great app, yet it makes my browser go super blazing fast."
-------------------------
browser
with so many different adds it would constantly make my browser reload.  I have tried so many different things.  So grateful one click and that is no longer an issue.  I love this App
-------------------------
browser
This blocks all ads and doesn't slow down your browser at all!
-------------------------
browser
great resource. my son adds it to my web browsers to keep spam adverts off my system and he even adds custom lists, for my personal prefs and it doesn't bog down my system!

GREAT EVEN FOR OLD LADIES! tested on an ASUS running Win 8.1 64-bit -touchscreen

5 STARS [smooth as silk now], and now that FanBoy's list has been added to EasyList it's 10 Stars!

note: supports international lists, so you can get comprehensive ad blocking coverage, in any region and if malwared? install the south pacific lists; especially CHINA!*

*they are why we need ad block by default and a script blocker/flash blocker. waiting on NoScript for Chrome! :D

SEE?! EVEN OLD LADIES CAN USE/INSTALL THIS! ;)
-------------------------
browser
Now I can get rid off annoying and explicit ads on my browsers.

This app is great!
-------------------------
browser
Fantastic. I almost forgot the way i used to browse the net but this extension made my browser clean and free from annoying ads.
Thanks Adblock Plus...
-------------------------
browser
Must have for every browser user. Excellent features for blocking unwanted adds on pages.
-------------------------
browser
for the longest time I couldn't figure out why my browser was getting sluggish while trying to watch videos online, as it turns out it was all these bloody adds taking up band width and getting in the way Well I cant thank you enough for this app and just would like to say Wayda GO! Keep up the great work and stay ahead of these dingbats who are being hogs. Its bad enough to have ads on TV but the internet!? come on!!! So far what Ive seen is that my browsers have returned to normal and load time is fast and zippy again thanks to this app. Its worth a payment of support
-------------------------
browser
Great app very helpful speeds up your browser.
-------------------------
browser
+5star. Works wonderfuly. 

Please note: Anyone having trouble with adblock no longer blocking ads, close all tabs/wepbages, remove it and re-add. Works for me all the time (May require you to restart your browser)
-------------------------
browser
Was the best add-on on my previous browser Fox and now is on my Chrome !!!
-------------------------
browser
It is very useful. Before install this, I was faced a lot of problem in using of Chrome. Where ever i click on browser one add opens up. now I feel really happy. Thanks for this plugin. still some more plugins are adding without my notice to the browser. If that one also can be removed, feel very happy.
-------------------------
browser
Works like a charm. Totally excellent -- I've finally got control of my browser again!
-------------------------
browser
nice way to block adds on browser
-------------------------
browser
This is the most useful extension ever created for a web browser. and i love it !!!!!
-------------------------

LOVE IT!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH for blocking all the excessive and annoying ads that were always blocking my browser and leading me to other websites when I click the 'X' button. THANK YOU ADBLOCK PLUS!! Finally! I can watch all my drama in peace! =D

Works great on my Macbook Air / Chrome browser
-------------------------

Still getting experience with this in chrome, liked it a lot in another browser
-------------------------
browser
Cool thing to add in your browser :D
-------------------------
browser
Amazing App. I have used ABP (and its various forks across browsers) for years. Recently it seems to not be working as well. Not sure if this is due to websites being extra diligent in bypassing ABP or what, but it has really made me realize how amazing this is when it works! Keep up the development :).
-------------------------
browser
Everyone must have this on their browser. It's incredible. You have to have it.
-------------------------
browser
I have never had a problem. Not even a hitch. This stops more ads than I thought it would and does not seem to slow anything down at all. In fact, it makes it so my browser does not have to load the ads!
-------------------------
browser
If you are getting adds in youtube when this is enabled you need to disable the other version of flash in your browser. Do a simple google search to find out how..  Works great!!
-------------------------
browser
its very usefull thing for browser.
-------------------------
browser
Couldn't live without it, since I simply CANNOT stand ads for those stupid "weight-loss" supplements which appear on every single website. Furthermore, it's pretty good about blocking those ads out there which, when loaded by your browser, install all sorts of nasty viruses and adware.
-------------------------
browser
While it's great and a major convenience, a lot of pop-ups (New windows, banner ads) are making their way through.  Other than that it works, and best of all, it's FREE. Highly recommend everyone takes the 30 seconds to download it on their browser.
-------------------------
browser
One of the most useful extensions on any web browser.
-------------------------
browser
awesome, browser spd also faster than ever.
-------------------------
browser
BEST BROWSER EXTENSION EVER. I possibly can't imagine browsing without this tool. A definitely must-have extension
-------------------------
browser
I have never had any problem with this addon whatsoever.  It's always worked exactly as promised, across a variety of different web browsers, and made my web browsing experience a whole lot more pleasant.  On lower-end machines, it does slow things down ever-so-slightly while loading, but aside from that, this is an absolute must have for both casual web surfers and people looking through specific sites.
-------------------------
browser
A must have for everyone for every browser you use, simple, comfortable, useful. I had in which ever browser I use.
-------------------------
browser
Works seamlessly in my browser, speeds up my searches and declutters my webpages from the annoying aggravating ads. I have recently reinstalled after changing my hard drive - and software. As a user of at least three years I have never been let down by Adblock plus.
-------------------------
browser
This is a great, never a problem in any browser I use this plugin in. A must-have for everyone.
-------------------------
browser
Love this extension! The first thing I add to Chrome when I install it (although, now that Google automatically downloads extensions on new instances of the browser, I don't need to add it manually)
-------------------------

Love it, love it, love it.  Absolutely one of the first plug-ins I get every time I need to get a new browser (new computer, or reformat & reinstall, or whatever).  One of the very first.  I don't understand why it doesn't come with every browser, except then, hum, what would all the advertisers do?  LOL
-------------------------
browser
It's simply a must have. It is probably my favorite extension in fact.I love it so much that it actually makes me angry when I'm using other computers and see all the ads that I've been missing since I put Adblock Plus in my browser. If you don't use Adblock then may God have mercy on your soul.

The best ad blocking solution for Chrome and Firefox. The other popular ad block extension hijacks your browser home page, and each time re-directs to their home page asking for donation.

Been using this for a good couple of years; definitely the best AdBlock out there for Chrome-Based Browsers.

(Currently using: Comodo Dragon)
-------------------------
browser
Excellent - never experienced such peace and quiet before, i.e. NO POP UPS/ADS ANYMORE!
One problem: my browser can't offer to save my passwords now - the  message which appears is considered a pop-up... 
Could this be fixed? The message is not invasive at all, and I'd like to know that my passwords are being saved. 

No problems with my browser speed. Perfect!
-------------------------
browser
It works very well.

Does anyone else notice the initial loading of it when opening a new chrome browser, it takes forever for adblock to load.

chrome browser status bar just hangs for a couple minutes saying loading adblock...

works perfect after it loads though
-------------------------
browser
Best pop-up blocker out there!!! Must have for any browser
-------------------------
browser
Amazing!!! 
Doesn't slow down the browser like Adblock does!

A must have for every browser, glad to see it on chrome.
-------------------------
browser
I love it on every browser its the best add blocker from my point of view..

Google Chrome is THE best browser. Google, I am hypnotized by your products... They are simple, dependable, and most importantly, your products are mostly free while still offering a gigantic variety of products and services that people depend upon from day to day. I must admit, even my beloved phone is a Google Android... My iPhone was water damaged in a sea kayaking capsize (the dry-bag was not appropriately closed) and I have been much happier with my Droid! Adblock, you are delightful and you pair with Chrome to(somehow?) create an even smoother browsing experience. Well, it's obviously because of the blocked advertisements. I am devout to both Google and AdBlock. Yesterday I opened my Firefox browser for the first time since reformatting my laptop. It was messy, slow, spammy, something Chrome was not before installing these extensions and applications. After installing the same extensions in Firefox and testing it out for a night, I gave up and quickly ran back into the comforting arms of Google Chrome! Firefox was horrifying. I had to remove so many toolbars and search engines, specifically YAHOO!, that I never installed. No other person has the keys to my laptop either... I always specify "NO" when installing programs that ask. These toolbars were never present within my Chrome and it was my first time opening Firefox since its initial installation. Firefox was a boggy nightmare. Thank you, Google, for so many privileges. I do not take these for granted. Customer service is supreme from my experiences compared to other websites. Considering the overload Google has, it is astonishing to me. Google even pays me! How much more could I, or anyone for that matter, ask of Google?
-------------------------
browser
It's weird... The first time I open a page, the extension doesn't work, but if I close and re-open the browser, it works fine...
-------------------------
browser
It is great. I only have one problem with this last update: every time I open my browser the new first-run page opens. It's only suppose to open only once after an update, but its being opening every time I open  my browser for the pass few days
-------------------------
browser
Love this app. Use it on all my browsers!
-------------------------
browser
Awesome App. accelerate your browser and improve the UX.
-------------------------
browser
A must for every browser!
-------------------------
browser
It's perfect!
It's fast and easy to use, I strongly recommend it to everyone that gets annoyed of adds!
What makes it special is, as I said, that it's fast and easy to use. Unlike most adds blockers that slows the browser down and sometimes makes it crash.
-------------------------
browser
Seems to work rather well on the RockMelt browser. Unsurprising , as it is written with Chrome code. Had a few issues where ads stopped being blocked, but a re-installation and refresh worked fine. Really good app.
-------------------------
browser
It is great when it works. But I notice that the ads reappear when the browser is left open for a while. The ABP icon is still lite, meaning it is not disabled. Manually disable and reenable ABP removes the ads, but not for long.
-------------------------
browser
For a BETA extension; this is by far the best for ad-blocking.  Reviewers complaining about the product in a review need to contact the developer to try to resolve these BETA issues.  Love it.  Use it.  Mandatory in my Chrome web browser.

I have a couple of macbook pros.
i learned not to do updates for safari, because it removed my adblock plus and i could never use it again... i have mojave on one, am not going to update it, and adblock plus is like God to me, living for two years with ads on youtube, now ad free completely...
i find every couple of weeks youtube or google comes out with a new bypass probably a trojan on a video i watch, but i found a way to stop all ads...
all you do is open the adblock plus icon on top of your screen, on CHROME, which I am using, NOT safari, it wont work on safari anymore... but on Chrome, when you install adblock plus, you get a red icon on top of screen. Click on the gear and open settings then on left go to Advanced, and then update your filter lists and you will stop all youtube ads...
ADBLOCK PLUS, i love you, saving me data way out in the bush using my phone... thank you guys you are tops...

Blocks ads for youtube and when watching tv shows on various websites. It is very nice. It does not stop your browsing data from being recorded. If you ask it too block them, it does some. Ghostely does the rest for me. Between the two, you have a lot of control over what advertisement companies can do to and "for you."

ABP got the blocks on lockdown. Extremely useful for Youtube specifically, no ads at all when viewing. That's really the extent of my use, but most other sights I'm not seeing ads on.
Also love that you can turn it on and off pretty fast. Needed to once and it wasn't confusing.

I have used this for two years at least.  Does what is says it will.  Development is consistent and frequent.  Occasionally there is a CPU hit, it gets resolved.  Very rarely there is an ad it does not catch, when reported and then blocked it usually solves this. Whitelisting sites or just pages is easy.  Thanks ABP!

Awesome extension that cut down on a lot of unnecessary ads... can also choose to have ads or no ads at all by turning off the ad blocker and refreshing the page. Saved me from lots of ugly ads blocking the page. Highly highly recommend! Works great on chrome, might slow down some processes a little (not tested but highly suspect) but overall good for daily usage.

Have always used Adblock on all my devices and have never had any issues with it. It is so easy to use and is free so what's not to love? This is always the first extension I ad to my new computers. Plus I always recommend it to friends due to it being such a reliable ad blocking service. I personally have never had any issues with it slowing down my pc in any way.

amazing! pop ups still appear, but this is an ad blocker, not a pop up blocker! so great product! never slowed my pc, maybe turning it off on certain sites lags it a bit, but the lag stops after 1 second, so its amazing!

Phenomenal. Does what it says, isn't malware (as far as I can tell after using it for 3+ years) and overall is super stable and reliable. Plus it's free, why not use it? Also in my case it has improved my performance loading websites contrary to some reviews saying it is a cpu hog.

this adblocker is exeptional I have been using it for 2 years and it has been extremely useful,
not only does it work very well as an ad blocker but it goes above and beyond. I am very thankful to the abp support teams who release continuous updates to the extension. I am very happy with the extension and would reccomend it to you if you are looking for a adblocker to keep your browsing safe fast.
-------------------------

Almost perfect, 99.9% of the time, it removes the Ads ... It does have some trouble with the Fandom wiki sites, but it could be that those are considered to be non-instrusive, but they *aint*, the change and flash, and slow the whole site down, especially when scrolling a big article. Otherwise, ABP is *Amazing* Love it. When I win the Lottery, I will Donate a lot!
-------------------------

This works. Like definitely works. I've been using it for a while, and I've only seen one ad. In any case where you see one just report it, it's not that hard. Also make sure you have 'Acceptable Ads' off. And of course, an ad will find a way through, which is why all ad blockers have to update. I don't know why people are having speed problems because Chrome's speed has been completely fine for me. It's a great ad blocker, and i'd recommend it. (‚úø‚ó°‚Äø‚ó°)

Adblock Plus has been a lifesaver for me.  We live in a rural community and our only internet is our cell phone hotspot.  I don't get enough speed or bandwidth to manage lots of ads or streaming, and we nearly gave up on internet altogether because of that.  Adblock Plus has changed all this and allows us to have internet access without all the additional web noise.  THANK YOU!
-------------------------
speed
Reliable and fuss-free. Love the ability to toggle the extension for certain websites and target specific ads with a right-click. I use it almost all the time to block out potential security threats or just to speed up loading. I definitely recommend this over any other ad blocking extensions.
-------------------------
speed
Not sure if you've found a replacement by now, but my recommendation has always been ublock origin (make sure it has origin in its name). It's simply the best blocker out there, hands down. Never experienced a single issue, not once, and it blocks absolutely everything. While at the same time giving you total control of exactly what, when, & where to block, if you choose to do so (optional, it works fine default). It's also the lightest on resources, speeding everything up instead of bogging it down. You can also add/enable/check additional filter lists in its settings. There's even one (or a few) that gets rid of all those annoying "disable adblocker" messages you were referring to.
-------------------------
speed
I've been using this extension for a while now. It always amazes me when I sit with a client who does not have this extension. The sheer number of ads being foisted on users is crazy!  A few get thru ABP. . .but this extension speeds my browsing immensely. Incredibly pleased!!!

-------------------------

-------------------------

Keeps most ads away but some sites are smarter than adblock. Very useful if you have slow internet.
-------------------------
cpu
Adblock Plus helped me to prevent the abnormal spike (over 90%) in CPUs core temperatures that occurred upon visiting websites containing poorly coded, CPU-hogging Flash-content, be they ads or non-ads. In addition, Adblock Plus helped with taking out all the notoriously obtrusive, non-Flash Ads in some of the news-websites which offer useful content, but are bad at keeping users' interests above their clueless Ad-Sales Team's interests and their Advertisers' interests.

Moreover, allowing users to whitelist content (ads or non-ads) is the most useful feature. It may require a learning-curve for many folks, but if one can figure out the way to manage that, it offers increased value.

I highly recommend Adblock Plus to every one who desires a rewarding user-experience while making meaningful use of the Web.

Thank you Team EyeO for this great work. May the Force be with you!

5* Review I use it for convenience. I have yet to ever encounter a problem. There may be those dodgy ads now and then, but I haven't noticed slowing from it. I personally believe those ads don't get blocked because they're more apart of the site itself, not just an ad on the side. In my opinion, the extension does what you want it to.

One of the best extensions ever. Some ads may still pop up, but thanks to Adblock Plus, most are kept at bay, especially the spammy ones on social networking sites such as facebook. It also helps to improve the performance of your browser when playing games, as a lot of the ads that it blocks would have been using the same plug-in which games on the browser use, thus slowing down the game's functions. With this extension, your web games performance will be enhanced.

Wonderful app, as other's have said it can make some sites slow to load.  My real beef thou is that the white list doesn't work, there are some sites that I both want and need to have the ads load but this refuses to allow them, which means I have to disable it
-------------------------

A bit slowing down the browsing, but it works

Does exactly what it should, allows you to customize and allow some ads if you want.  Fantastic! Speeds load times for most sites because you're not loading junky click-bait.
Cannot recommend enough.

I use an old Toshiba laptop which has a single core Celeron CPU. Prior to installing ABP CPU would peg quite often over 90%. Norton would popup a message indicating high cpu usage warning.

ABP stopped that completely and Chrome is very responsive now.

It's a great tool. Easy to turn off, easy to customize what should get blocked. Simple interface, although the pseudo-regex (using wildcards) pattern you need to use to add to the blocked list is a little tricky... still, it never crashes and doesn't slow down Chrome!

Keep up the great work and stay ahead of these dingbats who are being hogs. Its bad enough to have ads on TV but the internet!? come on!!!

Greatest thing EVER!!! No youtube ads, no hulu commercial breaks, I love it! only thing is it does slow down start up times on opening new pages, but that may just be because I have LOW ram in my Macbook but other than that, I adore it!!!

I haven't found an ad that it doesn't block.  It's amazing!  Doesn't slow down the PC, actually speeds it up, because unblocked ads are what slows mine down.  

Today, it stopped working for some reason.  No big deal.  I disabled it, then re-enabled it right away, and it was working fine.  5 seconds & 2 clicks, and all was good.

I have never had any problem with this addon whatsoever.  It's always worked exactly as promised, across a variety of different web browsers, and made my web browsing experience a whole lot more pleasant.  On lower-end machines, it does slow things down ever-so-slightly while loading, but aside from that, this is an absolute must have for both casual web surfers and people looking through specific sites.

-------------------------
cpu
I strongly prefer the Adblock Plus approach of blocking annoying ads will allowing ads that are not annoying (e.g. do not consume cpu resources, etc.).

This encourages all the websites that must depend on advertising to prefer well behaved, non-annoying, static ads.

All ad blockers should follow the lead of Adblock Plus in encouraging responsible and considerate advertisements.
-------------------------
slow
Recently added this to Chrome and it's performing perfectly so far.  Don't know why I waited so long to add this.

Does a GREAT job of suppressing ads which means a big improvement in my (slow DSL) online experience.

Excellent - never experienced such peace and quiet before, i.e. NO POP UPS/ADS ANYMORE!
One problem: my browser can't offer to save my passwords now - the  message which appears is considered a pop-up... 
Could this be fixed? The message is not invasive at all, and I'd like to know that my passwords are being saved. 

No problems with my browser speed. Perfect!

I love it! Super fast, unnoticeable, and nifty. However, I am concerned about the harm to the internet economy this could do on a mass basis (say, if 15,000 people used it) because the websites can not collect advertising money. Perhaps a semi-permeable adblock program?
-------------------------
slow
I love this program.  Popup ads are one of the most annoying things on the Internet.  They stop you from seeing things, randomly start blasting annoying videos while you are working, and slow down page loading.  As an added bonus, it stops those ads at the beginning of YouTube videos.  It has a few glitches on certain sites, but generally a great program.
-------------------------

This adblock extension is awesome! It blocks all ads on the sites I go on most! It makes my internet move jet fast and it is great for annoying ads that you'd normally see on sites like Addicting Games and other flash game sites.

Adblock Plus is a fantastic tool and add-on for Firefox, it allows you to block internet ads, block un-wanted images, which generally speeds up loading time on websites.

Google Chrome is THE best browser. Google, I am hypnotized by your products... They are simple, dependable, and most importantly, your products are mostly free while still offering a gigantic variety of products and services that people depend upon from day to day. I must admit, even my beloved phone is a Google Android... My iPhone was water damaged in a sea kayaking capsize (the dry-bag was not appropriately closed) and I have been much happier with my Droid! Adblock, you are delightful and you pair with Chrome to(somehow?) create an even smoother browsing experience. Well, it's obviously because of the blocked advertisements. I am devout to both Google and AdBlock. Yesterday I opened my Firefox browser for the first time since reformatting my laptop. It was messy, slow, spammy, something Chrome was not before installing these extensions and applications. After installing the same extensions in Firefox and testing it out for a night, I gave up and quickly ran back into the comforting arms of Google Chrome! Firefox was horrifying. I had to remove so many toolbars and search engines, specifically YAHOO!, that I never installed. No other person has the keys to my laptop either... I always specify "NO" when installing programs that ask. These toolbars were never present within my Chrome and it was my first time opening Firefox since its initial installation. Firefox was a boggy nightmare. Thank you, Google, for so many privileges. I do not take these for granted. Customer service is supreme from my experiences compared to other websites. Considering the overload Google has, it is astonishing to me. Google even pays me! How much more could I, or anyone for that matter, ask of Google?
-------------------------
slow
This thing is amazing in the sense that it is a small app that eliminates everything, every ad and pop up...100% of it!!!  I have yet to come across any software program that can actually do this.  Other software programs I have used may also slow down your computer too, but not ABP.  If anything ABP has allowed my system to run faster.

Been using this for a year or so and I absolutely love it.

Blocks all ads on many of the streaming sites I visit. Although it may occasionally miss an ad or two, all I have to do it disable the element and reload the page for the blocker to kick in.

I don't have a top notch PC but this does -not- slow chrome down on my dekstop OR laptop. I'm not quite sure why there are so complaints of this slowing people down... I haven't had any problems with it.

I decided to get rid of just ADBLOCK...my pc no longer makes loud noises. the ram has dropped from 1.8 to 1.25gb maximum and I feel very happy :) please download ABP over AB...they both use the same filters for blocking ads the extensions DO NOT block ads ... the filters do...

Does not get every single ad on the internet and it lately is letting all ads through. This extension is nice and VERY fast when it's compared to other adblock extensions.

Fix the recent issue of all ads getting through, and try to make it easier to block ads on a page using the "Easy create filter" option.
-------------------------

One of the best privacy extensions, it blocks unnecessary scripts with potential privacy leaks very efficiently.
Even if you accidentally open a blocked script, it warns you and lets you allow a specific URL temporarily or permanently if you need it.

They helped me solve the issue and quickly deployed the solution to the production environment.

As a frequent internet user, it is hard to not get ads shoved down your throat. The uBlock Origin extension is like a force field protecting me from intrusive ads and annoying elements of webpages. It makes browsing Fandom wikis and other websites with 100 septillion ads a whole lot easier. It is also helpful for blocking websites; as a matter of fact, I use it to block embedded TikTok videos and the TikTok site itself (so the CCP spies can't get me). So all in all, uBlock Origin is worth the download.

Problem right now Mar 2022, it is stopping Gmail from working properly. You can log in ok, but emails will not display. Turn uBlock off and all is ok.

On the whole, it is very good. It is detected by some sites & impedes performance, mainly free to air TV sites who run ads, so you just turn it off for those sites (I use a different app for those sites, which is undetected).

Does anyone else deal with the blocker blocking the screens that pop up on YouTube when trying to unsubscribe or add something to a playlist? I would just disable the blocker but I also use it as my main ad blocker for YouTube. And if anyone has any ideas on how to fix that'd be cool. Love this blocker though, really good for getting into websites that either want an account or just have hundreds of popups.

It's possible that Chrome has auto-updated which is causing the issue.  I'm still running Chrome v87 (1 year old) and works fine.  You could try uninstalling and reinstalling uBlock to see if that helps.  You could also just disable uBlock for the bill-pay site only by clicking on the uBlock icon the top right then on the big blue button.  Ads would still be blocked for all other sites except for the bill-pay one.

Ublock has been a nice reliable and customizable blocker over the years. There is more power there than I need. The best features are the automated ones and ability to right clock block elements since most people aren't going to spend a lot of time figuring out complex options.

PLEASE add ability to easily block entire sites. Look at all the low quality site blocker/time management apps people download. Ublock could be getting some of that traffic by simply add in the ability to block entire sites or even add in time periods to block sites at certain times as these are SUPER easy options compared to the other coding the developers have done to filter out specific elements. A nice right click block entire site option would be nice.

Simple, effective, does what you need, can be turned on and off easily, blocks unwanted video ads.

Fantastic adblocker, never had a problem with it. I only wish it was able to block Twitch ads the same way that it blocks YouTube ads
-------------------------
block
THIS IS AMAZING
it's the original one, it blocks ads and it's quick and easy to figure out! I really recommend this. It's my first time ever using a ad blocker and i'm really happy it's turned out so well! I will recommend this to my friends. tho the first time it blocked a ad smth popped up 4 a sec. Think it was a ad... but it quickly it    was removed so I think it worked! It's amazing any you HAVE to try it. Like it's just to good-
-------------------------
protect
nice adblock also protects you from viruses, hacker and other stuff like that! doesn't really black ads it just like makes them sorta invisible but it's good!
-------------------------
block
The fact that it broke and I realized exactly how much it was blocking before I repaired it made me come here specifically to give it a 5 star review. amazing blocker.
-------------------------
block
Interesting how the most recent chrome update (92.0.4515.107) disabled Ublock....

This extension works phenomenally. I used Adblock for well over a decade but it wasn't fairing so well on certain sites. Ublock is very powerful and picks up the slack where Adblock sadly started failing. My only qualm is how it often blocks external weblinks, but you can easily bypass the warnings and save your settings. Overall, however, that's a very good feature.

9/10
-------------------------
block
Perhaps the only adblocker that works perfectly with Amazon.com without breaking it! It blocks those pesky sponsored posts and the added "Element Picker Mode" allows you to block whatever else annoys you on Amazon's Home Page. Simply fantastic!
-------------------------
block
The plugin works incredibly well, it completely blocks advertisements, tracking cookies like the little facebook icon, and all of the pop-ups that appear. Unlike some Adblocker programs, uBlock doesnt make exceptions to advertisements unless you specify (other adblockers allow advertisers to pay extra to allow their ads through the blocker). I have never had a problem with uBlock, there is no nonsense about it and it has a large team of people working on it. Since it's open-source, the entire program is public to read, so it is almost undoubtedly safe
-------------------------
block
Works great, lots of options to dial in exactly what you want, and lets you choose to block almost any element on a web page, even if it's not an add, by right clicking and adding a filter. Been using uBlock Origin for years, definitely my favorite adblock extension.
-------------------------
block
I find this to be the most reliable and easy to use of ad-blockers. No nonsense, and it really does a great job of blocking malicious websites and pop-ups. If anything it's too effective sometimes.
-------------------------
block
It amazes me how people still complain about ads on YouTube videos. Either watch them and shutup, or get an adblock. They don't even know they've existed for like 20 years now. And this one happens to be the most comprehensive, lightweight, and most efficient overall ad block.
-------------------------
block
amazing adblocker that has worked right out of the block for me for several years. could not have asked for anything more.
-------------------------
block
i love it doesn't try to bs me easy to use blocks ads and doesn't ask me to pay for anything would download agien
-------------------------

i love this and i wounded how they earn money from blocking ads , i am little bit of scared of collecting data..good work its make mo productivity

OMG! I just figured out how to block the ANNOYING pop-ups that Facebook throws up because I refuse to create an account. Now, I can look at my son's school's Facebook page in peace. THANK YOU!!!!!
-------------------------
block
It has saved my life on my computer MULTIPLE TIMES! And it blocks ads. It does it's job and gets you out of websites that might steal your personal information which is really handy. This is one of the times today that it has saved me and that's why i'm writing this review. I had another extention on and it said my credit card information was public. I meant to hit the X but it sent me to a site and uBlock Origin saved me because it was going to steal my information. Thank you and this is why I give you five stars.
-------------------------
block
Can't block facebook ads
-------------------------
block
This is actually so good, just need to right click on what I wanted to delete and highlight it and boom gone permanently and if I needed to get a part back, I can just go into the my filters and delete it from there and I learned all this just a few minutes ago when this post was made, so I highly recommend anyone who has that annoying feature on their favourite site or for any ads (which this does automatically), this is very good indeed. (Edit): When it stopped blocking ads I just reinstalled and that did the job, until they update that's probably the way to fix the issue. And you can import anything you want removed.
-------------------------
block
Works perfectly. Blocks all ads on youtube, and all pop up ads. Even blocks ads on spotify and more! Absolutely incredible, highly recommend it to anyone who is sick of ads.

Dear Raymond Hill,

This adblocker... is unlike any adblocker I've ever seen. One time when I was on PowerPoint Mobile online, I saw that Ublock Origin blocked 103 ads on that page. That's insane. The adblocker I had before this adblocker was called Adblocker - Stop Ads on Every Site. This adblocker didn't even block ads on YouTube!!! But this one does. That's very convenient for me and is AWESOME to see. I love your product, man!!! ‚ù§
-------------------------
block
It was great for a long time, but now it's not blocking YouTube ads which is annoying.
-------------------------
block
This was my favourite ad blocker for years and it still mostly works without problem. However, it's been some time since it stopped blocking YT ads.
-------------------------
block
It has stopped blocking Youtube Ads
-------------------------
block
Hands down best ad blocking extension I have used over the years. After switching to this one 4-5 years ago, I haven't looked back. I did however getting some youtube ads starting today 5/20/2021. It would be awesome if those go away soon so I don't have to consider other extensions.
-------------------------
block
It used to work fine before but I doesn't block ads as of May 2021
-------------------------
block
yes it was not blocking ads on youtube , recently
-------------------------
block
It was working normally until I updated my google chrome today, now youtube plays the ads normally and doesn't get blocked at all. Please update the plugin Devs !! Thanks.
-------------------------

It was amazing up until now. It no longer blocks pre-video ads on YouTube.

-------------------------
block
This adblocker works perfectly! It blocks all the unwanted ads!
-------------------------
block
This is an adblocker I have been using for about 3 weeks now, and I just have to say that I love it. It's amazing, and works just fine for me. When I go to sites to watch dramas, they usually have a lot of pop-up ads. With this extension, it doesn't happen anymore. Same for youtube. I don't have to deal wit ads there anymore! There's also another website that I use to watch dramas. If anyone in here likes to watch kdramas/cdramas/jdramas/reality shows, you have definitely hear if Viki. I use the basic account, no Viki Pass/Viki Pass Plus, so I have to go through the ads and all. This adblocker actually blocks them all. Some inefficient ones can't go through Viki and Viki will usually tell you to turn off your adblocker. Howevere, this adblocker is just amazing. Anyways, I don't think theres any bad parts (not any yet, at least).

Blocking ads perfectly and keeps RAM :) good adblock

block
it works very well and i dont need to play to block ads

Fantastic ad blocker. Very occasionally you'll find it fails to block the 5 second "Vrbo" ads with the little pie-shaped countdown on YouTube, but I haven't had the jarring noises of ads in my ear in years.
-------------------------
block
This is simply the best ad blocker out there. It runs very fast and it even block ads on YouTube! I have been using it for as long as I have been using chrome and have never had a problem!
-------------------------
block
The best adblocker, even blocks ads on crunchyroll.
-------------------------
block
it blocks all adds and is amazing. if you don't have this get it.
-------------------------
block
Never had a problem with ublock. also, it has helped me a lot since I've entered unwanted websites and ublock, blocks them, and it's the most powerful ad blocker out there. I've never had an ad since I installed ublock.
-------------------------
block
This is very useful and I am using it for couple of years now, it never troubled me and efficiently block all adds without even you noticing it and no lags or hangs keep it up to the developers
-------------------------
block
This extension is just amazing. Not only does it block all ads, not only does it stop those annoying youtube search settings/recommendations that aren't even related to your actual search, but it's also just amazing given that this is free.
-------------------------
block
I've been using this adblocker for what feels like forever now. It's very helpful. Easy to use with literally just a click of a button to get working properly. It blocks Youtube and Spotify Ads. What can I say? It's really good!
-------------------------
block
Does not block twitch ads now
-------------------------
block
I've been using this app for a long time. It doesn't pester me to buy anything, doesn't pester me to check my settings all the time. Sometimes, I forget I have it.

It just WORKS, quietly and efficiently, in the background, blocking more ads than any other extension. 

Absolutely indispensable. Thank you to the person or people who made it.
-------------------------
block
i LOVE how you can block specific elements
-------------------------
block
This is the very best add blocker I have ever seen. It blocks all ads, and you can block whatever you want with it. it is great!

it is funny i can zap things off the page :D i just dont like how it blocks half a quarter of the websites i go to that are normal!!!!!!!!!!

Best ad remover that I know of. 
Not as resource hungry as most adblockers, yet still blocks most annoyances and easy and simple interface.

I've been using uBlock Origin for years and it's the best ad blocker out there! It blocks every single kind of ad aggressively. Pages even load much faster as a result, I also love the element blocking feature. BTW, great job! much more than an ad blocker!

Best spectrum content blocker, I have ever used. Never had a problem with it. It blocks all ads, pop-ups, redirects, trackers and malicious links. Very Happy with the ExtensionüôÇüôÇ

Much better than competitors that advertise for themselves in new tabs every other time you open chrome. this just silently blocks ads and does a great job of avoiding detection. excellent!

block
Just awesome‚ù§. It's block unwanted add. lot of love for developer. I am very happy using this extension.

Literally the best adblocker on the web. Even bypasses those stupid "verification" things on sites like Linkvertise and just gives you the direct link. IDK how it works, but I am extremely thankful. <3

This Ad blocker is amazing! the other fake one doesn't even block ads at all. The fake one is called UBlock | free adblocker
-------------------------
block
Highly recommend this extension for blocking ads. It works exactly the way it says it does.

The issue with Twitch ads coming through is annoying, but I think that is Twitch not Ublock failing.
-------------------------
block
Great adblock (unlike adblock plus) this blocks all the ads I've seen and is very light. Even improves performance in some cases due to the removal of ads that were taking up processing power
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block facebook video ads.
-------------------------
block
love this extension and ive been using it for years! the only issue that ive really just realized thats been caused by ublock is often when im typing, my input character will jump around in whatever sentences i type :(
I toggled all the settings in my computers control panel, and eventually decided to test which extensions exasperated the issue, and turns out ublock is the cause ^^'
Im only mentioning this in the review incase others are having a similar issue (and ive been researching haplessly for quite a while, finding very few concise answers!)
Otherwise, it works phenomenally! between youtube, spotify, and pandora alone, i swear hours upon hours of my time have been saved undistracted by the ads ublock blocks! On top of that, my hands tend to be a bit whack, and accidental clicks happen alot, so i definitely feel more at ease knowing i dont have to worry from accidentally clicking random ads ^^'
-------------------------

This is amazing and blocks adds everywhere.

Blocks ads on everything its so good.

I'm using it since 2 years ago and it does the job.

very good and block element also helps many of my friends struggle to respawn in some games after long ads but me i have this powerful extension best for anime website too and if something is that u want to remove like donation part or blah blah just take block element and is free also has a block pop up option and make it permanent when we click more. "IT'S FREE", no trial or annything no money, just free"
-------------------------
block
A safe, and security focused ad blocking plugin. By far the first extension I download on any chrome browser.
-------------------------
block
I have used for a while now and I have loved it. Blocks a ton of unwanted ads, not a virus/rat, and is amazing overall.
-------------------------
block
Literally the best ad blocker ever. Pretty much blocks ads exactly how I want it to and I don't have to do a single thing.
-------------------------
detect
Best adblocker I have ever used. Most websites can't even detect it, so if there is a website saying ''disable your adblocker to enter'', it won't do that for uBlock Origin.
-------------------------
block
been using it for a year now and it blocks all adds on youtube and other websites
but for reason recently it has not been blocking ads on twitch 
but overall really good experience
-------------------------
block
After this latest update Twitch ads came back. This extension was incredible. If it starts blocking Twitch ads again then it will officially be the best in my opinion.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block Twitch.tv ads anymore. Hoping for an update! Other than that, been using for ages, awesome extension!
-------------------------

Doesn't block twitch ads >:(

A significant step up from ABP, blocking youtube ads and overlays unlike the latter.
-------------------------
block
Does not Block Twitch ads.
-------------------------

Doesn't deserve the poor reviews because Twitch ads are suddenly no longer being blocked, its being great for years and will definitely be updated.
-------------------------
block
Pretty good adblocker until it stopped blocking ads on Youtube and Twitch.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block twitch ads anymore, was fine few days ago but now ads are triggering
-------------------------
block
For an essential extension, the features are minimal and the expectation is only on performance and how well the extension is in blocking the ads. Had no performance issues and definitely had more effect than its competitors.
-------------------------
block
Been using this ad block for years and it's the best. Recently having issues with twitch tv though :(
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block new facebook videos ads!
-------------------------
block
I normally use Adblock plus however, they don't block the ad blocker popup so I switched to uBlock and I'm very happy and can confirm that they are also removing that. So I will be using this software.  Thank You!!!
-------------------------
block
I have always been the Adblocker user but when I came across Origin, I have to say I'm loving it. Blocks everything which is what I want and it's easy to whitelist a site too. Very satisfied with this extension!
-------------------------
block
Worked wonders for years, one of the best addon for Chrome and Firefox. My only doubt is, in the future do you plan on also blocking things on Youtube Music? :)
-------------------------
block
I've been using it for over a year now, and have almost never had a problem with it. It blocks all the annoying pop-ups on websites and allows for easy ad-free browsing.
-------------------------
block
Amazing, even though it sometimes blocks videos you just got a go to its setting turn off the filters and boom.
-------------------------
block
recently it doesn't block youtube video ads but olsun be aga senin yerin ayri be

Great for blocking Twitch ads!
-------------------------
block
blocks about every ad out there. i recommend this to everyone i know.
-------------------------
block
Absolutely brilliant product, blocks almost every ad and redirect on almost every site. Way better than I expected.
-------------------------
detect
The absolute best. Even for ads it doesn't detect, it gives you a little tool to have them removed for yourself permanently. This just blows all the other adblockers out of the water. i tried adblock, adblock plus, and other various blockers, once i found Ublock there was no turning back. its free and gives you the internet the way it was meant to be.
-------------------------
block
THANK YOU! Finally, a GOOD adblocker. Blocked so many unwanted ads and malware. THANKS!
-------------------------
block
THIS IS The bes yt i  bkoc  BLOCK ad mobicl EVRR I ZOve THIS D MBLOCK WOOO MUCH!!!!!!! I.t irt so coo good
-------------------------

By far one of the best extension for ad blocking !!
-------------------------
block
Love it. Best blocking option I have seen.
-------------------------
block
uBlock Origin works like a CHARM!!! You will have a complete protection against ads, cookies and malwares if you use these: Google built in Cookies block, uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger.

Google built in Cookies block, uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger = Complete protection
-------------------------
detect
I've used this extension for years and I love it.  Continues to work and stops 99.9% of the ads you don't want to see.  And whitelisting sites that detect an ad blocker is easy to do as well.
-------------------------
block
Love the app, but the new ads on youtube aren't automatically blocked.
-------------------------
protect
Never had an issue using uBlock Origin. I use it on all my browsers along with Decentraleyes, and Cookie Autodelete. I highly recommend using all 3 together as a regimen for protection.
-------------------------
block
It's nice but it doesn't block white pop up ads on youtube videos
-------------------------
detect
It works really well and even manages to disable ads that other ad blockers don't detect. Would definitely recommend!
-------------------------
block
Best adblocker i ever used. It also blocks 'adblock detection' in most websites.
-------------------------
block
Awesome! Blocks adfly, and tons of ads/malware/redirects!
-------------------------
block
Awesome. It does everything for you, and you can even block those "non ads" websites have but they really are asking you to donate or blah blah blah.
This is is amazing, best add blocker out there üòÅ
-------------------------
block
Literally the most amazing adblocker. Started using it in 2019. Absolutely amazing. Never once had a problem. Only complaint is that some ads aren't blocked but since there is a manual element blocker it's practically not a complaint but a TINY flaw which is fine. Nothing's perfect.
-------------------------
block
AdBlock is a grandchild of uBlock Origin. uBlock Origin is the original program that Adblock was built off of since it was a free open source code at first. But take heed, take notice that Adblock is often confused with AdGuard. 

AdGuard is a program, not an extension of your browser, and it monitors and profits from sitting in the background as a separate program and eyeballs ALL the sites you visit, keeping a record and roster of each one, then sells that information to ad marketing groups. 

That is why, if you notice, uBlock Origin and AdBlock sit on the side as merely an extension of your browser (posting an icon in the upper right hand corner of your browser window) and does not hijack a list of monitored internet sites you visit like AdGuard does. AdGaurd tries to fraudulently deceive you around the point by claiming they protect off line content too within various apps, but all that means in real life is that they do that to get a list of your total computer activity, not just your internet browsing activity. AdGaurd is not a malicious program, but do not be deceived, IT IS AN INVASIVE PROGRAM!

Also, if you get use to using uBlock Origin you will see that they have settings in their control icon where you can block a pages' media data and what-not else, but you can also turn that off and be free to use media players and such on specific sites. You just have to tell it what to do. uBlock is by far the best out there right now IMHO if you include privacy, trust, and genuineness in their agreement with users.
-------------------------
block
So far the best ad-blocking extension out there. The only one that can successfully block performance-heavy ads on our news portals. Also with quite extensive options including blocking individual elements manually.
-------------------------
block
The best of the best ad blockers! I have used this ad blocker for years and has always worked 1000% better than the competing ad blockers! If you want to block all ads then say no more because uBlock Origin has you covered!
-------------------------
block
The best Adblocker, ever. 0 ads everything blocked :)
-------------------------
block
It blocks everything and doesn't slow down my comp at all
-------------------------
detect
I haven't had a single ad since adding to Chrome and few sites detect it. It also has interesting tools for changing the view of a website.
-------------------------
block
Very good @ blocking annoying ads and dangerous malvertisements. Would recommend it.
-------------------------
prevent
Used to work perfectly until about a week ago. Now it prevents any web page from loading at all when enabled, but only on my laptop. I have to disable it in chrome for any site to load at all. My desktop (my chrome is synced so all extensions are the same) works perfectly with ublock enabled. I'm hoping this is just an issue with a recent update to either the extension or to my laptop that will get resolved because the extension is fantastic and has been for years.
-------------------------
block
Have used this for years and it has worked well. In the last couple of day I've notice that it seems to block nothing. I uninstalled it and reinstalled and seems to work fine now. Thanks for keeping junk off my browser.
-------------------------
block
this app is strong. i Love the interface. specially for using Block All Popups Button easily
-------------------------
block
The best ad block extension I have ever used. Undetectable by pages that require whitelist, blocks all ads on pages, not only popups, but TrafficJunky and similar services as well. No more annoying ads on YouTube, Twitch.tv and similar pages. Custom rules, filters, whitelists, IP blocks, everything can be edited in HTML as well as be transferred across clients and platforms (for advanced users and developers). Extension is supported on GitHub as well. I absolutely love it! 5 stars!
-------------------------
block
It is user-friendly and does its job well. Ever since I installed this app, it has helped me blocked many unnecessary adds and at the same time it has allowed chrome to run faster
-------------------------
block
uBlock is extremely effective. It blocks all ads before YouTube videos, during Spotify jam sessions, and on those sites that are normally covered in pop-ups. It has not slowed my computer or browsing experience at all, and I am very satisfied with its performance.
-------------------------
block
the best extension to block ads
-------------------------
block
Better than AdBlock. It blocks more ads and most websites don't detect it. Very efficient.
-------------------------
block
Switched from adblock plus over to this and all I can say is its even better!!! I should have made the switch years ago, this literally blocks ALL popups. There were certain sites that even adblock plus failed to block but this extension is amazing!!!
-------------------------
block
this is literally the best ad block in the world
-------------------------
block
uBlock Origin is a fantastic ad-blocker; it's the only one I use. Easy on system resources, and 100% effective against blocking ads and tracking scripts. The pop-up interface is straightforward and customizing the extension's settings is very easy. Highly recommend.
-------------------------
block
Best adblocker ever. Even blocks ads from Youtube and hulu!
-------------------------
block
This is the best adblock out there for me. it worked better than AdBlock which blocked some ads but after refresh it didn't but UBlock did the work and perfectly. Recommended
-------------------------
block
I've tried almost every adblocker that doesn't look like it will give your computer a virus and this one was by far the best. Didn't affect battery life and I haven't seen a single ad since i downloaded it, while other adblockers let a few ads through here and there. Also, it's the only adblocker of the multiple I've tried that actually blocks ads on twitter. By far the best adblocker out there.
-------------------------
block
Works really well and blocks all those annoying ads, plus it's easy access.
-------------------------
block
Amazing, works even for blocking spotify's ads.
-------------------------
block
Amazing AdBlock! why did i knew about this now? keep up the good work and keep on blocking ads.
-------------------------
block
Ublock Origin works flawlessly for the most part. Low CPU usage and perfect ad blocking, however as of the time of this review Twitch.tv stream  have been loading extremely slowly and buffering often whilst the blocker was on. Running the same streams without Ublock and then with Adblock, the streams worked flawlessly. Hopefully this issue is looked into soon, otherwise I cannot fully recommend it to people who enjoy watching Twitch
-------------------------
block
This has been the best adblocker for years. You can pick and block any elements on sites that annoy you, and easily disable popups for individual websites.
-------------------------
block
I have been using these for years probably with absolutely no problems, favourite ad blocking extension and by far, the best one I have used!
-------------------------
block
Best ad block !
-------------------------
block
I've been using this for years and recommend it to EVERYONE. It doesn't block 100% of the ads, but I would say a close 98%. Facebook is so much easier to read now without all the ads. And I love looking up to the corner and seeing how many ads have been blocked. :)
-------------------------
block
Ive tried a few different ad blockers and this by far is the best so far blocks all ads and even by passes sites that have restrictions on blocking ads big thumbs up here
-------------------------
block
I like this Ad Blocker but it does block websites that are important to browse so it needs examined but i am giving it a 5 Star cause it's worth it .
-------------------------
block
Best adblocker by far. Extremely efficient, blocks almost all of those "please disable your adblocker" popups, and has useful features like the element zapper. Full recommendation from me.
-------------------------
block
It works! If Google blocks it, I will stop using Chrome!
-------------------------
block
No problems, works great.

I've been using it for a couple months now. It works amazingly, though for some sites it blocks too much, but turning it off for select sites just by pressing the power button in the corner is easy.
-------------------------
block
literally iam in love with this extension .....i mean every type ads all blocked ....iam totally satisfied!!!!
-------------------------
block
absolutely phenomenal ad blocker, ive had no problem with it whatsoever, especially happy with blocked ads on spotify. thank you guys so much!!
-------------------------
block
I like this extension, it really block unwanted ads from popping up my screen. recommended
-------------------------
block
A functional and efficient open-source extension with customizable block lists that are updated frequently.

This extension is useful for many things, not just ad blocking. For instance, if I want to take a screenshot of a webpage, I can use the thunderbolt icon to remove elements from a webpage I don't want, then take the screenshot. 
You can remove elements aside from ads.

I don't really use ublock for adblock, I mainly just use it to block malware (enabling the malware lists and unbreak filters) and remove elements as I see fit. It's good for this purpose because of its excellent customizability.
-------------------------
block
It DOESN'T block adblock detection
-------------------------
block
Great extension, I've used many others but uBlock Origin does its job the best. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a system that can block ads, malware and even more if you tinker around with its advanced settings.
-------------------------
block
Flawlessly blocks ads, especially the ones on twitch which other adblockers seem to struggle with. I'm curious though if there's any other adblockers that can block twitch ads now.
-------------------------
block
Blocked more pop ups than any other extension I have used. Very efficient

Best ad blocking extension of all. Have been using since i tried it. üòÅüòç
-------------------------
block
Simple and the best ad block I have tried
-------------------------
block
I have been using it for years and never had any issue with it. It has been the best adblocker I have used so far. But since today morning it is not blocking any kind of youtube ads. Neither banner nor video ads
-------------------------
block
hope google doesn't block it, its fantastic
-------------------------

Thanks Raymond Hill for making this awesome extension. Super easy, configurable and less heavy on resources. It's sad to see Chrome finally going to make this extension unusable in few months. But till then I'll use it faithfully. Tried switching to Firefox for privacy but a lot of websites had very sluggish performance and it became quite unresponsive with a few sites. 

Thankfully, I got Steven Black host file installed to be prepared for the D-day. It is not as effective as uBlock Origin and doesn't block Google search ads, Youtube ads. But still it's working okayish.
-------------------------
block
Actually I'm amazed by how small yet powerful it is.
It can block ads in videos, by all means. in China, it worked although not great but fine.
Hope they will continue to maintain it.
-------------------------
block
This ad blocker is a true savior when it comes blocking those nasty hideous ad tracker it can stop them and this extension can even block even more stuff. Love it, I recommended for family member or even friends!!!!
-------------------------

this wonderful plugin block (on click popups), iframe ads and popups.
Thank you so much
-------------------------
block
Outstanding all around, works extremely well. Protects my computer from harmful sites, blocks ads everywhere, and allows easy workarounds if I need to set up website-specific permissions. 
100% recommended, easy and free.
-------------------------
block
excellent extension.  Just worried that Google is going to block this in an upcoming Chrome patch.  We value privacy and freedom to surf.    Please do not block nor inhibit this extension.   Thanks.

It's not blocking facebook ads!
-------------------------

They're working on it, but Facebook ads are really hard to block.
-------------------------
block
ive had it for 10 minutes. Its blocked over 15k ad elements. i love it
-------------------------
block
It's the best ad-blocker I have ever used! So many options for blocking, you can even block things that are just unwanted in a web-page!
-------------------------
protect
It's a shame we have to use this to protect ourselves like this but in the battle against raging spamfests and infected flash ads, Raymond Hill should be heralded as an angel of freedom. Ublock Origin is the most seemless undemanding and efficient blocker I've ever used.(and I used host files in the late 80's)   Highly recommended
-------------------------
detect
Works even on pages where other adblocks gets detected and page locks content!
-------------------------

good ad block
-------------------------

Blocks everything!! It's phenomenal, in my opinion, and I highly recommend it!

OMG - after months of trying various other extensions and solutions to block ads and pop-up JW Player videos this worked like magic "out of the box". A BIG thank you to the developers.
-------------------------

Being bombarded by advertising sickens me... Ublock blocking em' all makes me be free and happy like a bird out in the wild. I appreciate that. WHOLLY. Screw advertising.
-------------------------
block
Amazing blocker, blocks everything, and this should be on everyone's browser.
-------------------------

I understand its not one but don't say its not one because most people only use it for ad blocking **me** and thank you for this wonderful tool!!!

it works with brave to block yt ads
-------------------------
block
I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.

"Our website is having trouble interacting with your ad blocking software. If you‚Äôre experiencing issues we apologize and suggest that you try disabling your current ad blocker or switching to a different ad block provider. Thank you. " I will live with that too bad MSN>   YEAH too bad suckers. LOVE THIS APP.  and all the rest that block all the spys.
-------------------------
block
This is the only ad blocker that works right for me. 
I have tried some of the others and they block on almost everything. 
This is the only one that does not slow down  my PC 
And Vivaldi Browser works so much better than CHrome. IMO
-------------------------
block
I could never go back to how horrible the web was before ad-blockers, with pop-ups and blinking banner-ads everywhere. Now all is clean and nice. Web developers need to make advertising less intrusive or people will always block ads.
-------------------------
block
This is the best aadblock no doubt about it, and the function to block specific elements from loading in a specific webpage is a very useful tool.
-------------------------
block
dont block javascript and it wont happen
-------------------------
block
Great ad block add on. The best ever!
-------------------------
block
This extension is excellent and blocks an enormous number of ads and behavior tracking systems for me. Use this as your ad blocker. I've never had any issues with it. 

It's also built by a few developers who don't even take donations and are doing it for the common good - such an inspiration.
-------------------------
block
The best ad-blocker I've tried. I particularly like how easy it is to turn on or off. There are some sites I don't want to block the ads for, such as when I'm watching a YouTuber who depends on ad revenue. uBlock remembers which sites you don't want to block the ads for as well, so you don't have to remember to switch it back on or off.
-------------------------
block
I think this is the best Ad block so far. Thank you
-------------------------
block
Ublock is the best ad blocker i've seen by miles. Blocks ads that others couldn't.
-------------------------
block
good work and the best ad blocking extension , thanks !
-------------------------
block
Works perfectly and can block most adds in every site. Love it!
-------------------------
block
Really helpful in blocking popups and ads that usually give my PC problems or even downloads viruses. Would recommend!
-------------------------
block
Because FB made it so that adblockers can't block their ads.
-------------------------
block
Super easy to enable/disable and super helpfull community!! Totally recommend.

I've had a couple sited that didn't get blocked properly, one post on reddit forum and within hours it was fixed :D
-------------------------
block
Blocks ads and popups on pornhub!! I love it!!!

The best adblocker out there; it blocks every single ad.
-------------------------

Excellent ad blocker that seamlessly functions while I use the browser. Doesn't slow it down so far and truly blocks everything!
-------------------------
block
Excellent. Blocks everything and it's really good for low-resource computers.
-------------------------
block
You do realise that Facebook came up with a way to show ads without any adblockers being able to block ads? This is not Ublock Origion's fault
-------------------------
block
Been using this extension for years now, and thoroughly enjoy having it. It has saved me so much time from not having to watch advertisements and I am very grateful for that. However, please come out with an update to block Twitch ads again.
-------------------------
block
Amazing. Blocks more then any other ad blocker. Using it for years already
-------------------------
block
Can no longer block facebook ads
-------------------------
block
Reliable, Fast and and thorough! uBlock Origin is seriously one of the best add-ons you can get for a browser and should be running on everyone's internet browser. It doesn't get in your way and block the websites you want to access [unless they're actually malicious] like other AdBlocker services do.
-------------------------
block
This from my experience is the greatest ad block extension available, you can filter for what you want manually, or add in bulk by copying filter lists, allowing for great versatility over other ad block software I've tried, it's also a relatively light extension as far as high end ad block extensions come, so that's another big plus, I can't fault Ublock-Origin at all, it's a must.
-------------------------
block
I love it /block disturb advertising
-------------------------
block
I use a LAN level micro-server to block about 90% of ads on my network, but the few that manage to slip through are always caught by uBlock Origin. I've used it for as long as I can remember, and it's still the best in my honest opinion. 10/10 would recommend
-------------------------
detect
I used to use AdBlock until I recently came across this blocker and I LOVE IT its extremely fast and best part is that it isn't detected by any sites I love it!

Can't live without the ability to block ad revenue from those that don't deserve it. Wonderful extension.

This is awesome at blocking YouTube ads! It runs smoothly and works quietly in the background. Perfect!

This is the best ad block that you can get. I had it with Mozilla Firefox and wondered why Firefox always blocked more adds and pop-ups than Chrome did and this is the answer.
-------------------------
block
Awesome. Blocks all the noise.
-------------------------
block
In short terms, the best ad blocker I have ever used. It blocks every ad I've seen so far, and it doesn't slow down Chrome at all. A must have, for sure.
-------------------------
block
thanks for the ad-blocker, it works great and you can choose elements to block
-------------------------
block
Love this so much! It blocks all ads; youtube, google ads, everything
-------------------------
block
It hasn't been blocking youtube and dailymotion ads these days and can't block pop ups on certain streaming sites.
-------------------------
block
Really good ad-blocker, also allows you to block certain elements that you don't like
-------------------------
block
Since AdBlock sold out and is now serving custom ads, uBlock is a MUST HAVE.
Blocks advertisements so well I cant even imagine the internet without it.
-------------------------
detect
With so many sites detecting AdBlock and it eating so many resources, switching to this was an easy choice, especially after reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews for the tool. I already use it in Mozilla and I kept forgetting to install it here. Now I've done it, and all is well with my world.
-------------------------
block
Amazing, blocks 30% more ads than AB and ABP and blocks 110% more ads than AdGuard. 10/10
-------------------------
block
uBlock is by FAR the best ad blocker I've used, it has a clean control panel, and it actually blocks every single ad, no popups.
-------------------------
block
uBlock better than adblock plus, bc adblock plus can't block so many popups ads, uBlock totally resolved my issue, no more popups now
-------------------------
block
Love this adblocker! one of the best ones that I have found. But still there is one problem where it wont block ads on some other sites like fandom.wikia I would love for that to be fixed.

Anyway, it is a great extension!
-------------------------
block
Great alternative to adblock which in my case would not block a single ad for some reason. Fast and Lite what's not to like?
-------------------------
block
It is a very good ad blocker. It blocks most things without an issue and handy to unblock things as needed.

I like that it does not make anything slower.

It just works! This technology is as important in protecting your on-line activity as antivirus!

i dont usually review things from the webstore but i just had to for this one. i tend to go to many site, from vape to gaming and this extension is amazing. any NEGATIVE REVIEW about blocking everything either are lazy or expect the extension to do everything for them. heres a little fact upon right clicking the extension you go into setting and you can set everything like you want it and how you want it even setup a WHITELIST to prevent the extension from blocking whatever site you want. the extension does exactly they say it should do and i highly recommend it been using it for more than 2+ years and i wont stop using it...
-------------------------

Best adblocker out there. Doesn't use too much resources, has plenty of filters to protect you, and blocks ALL ads. Really simple design too.

How can I donate?
Efficient and reliable.
Also includes additional options to increase navigation speed.
The best so far to block pop-up windows.
Best app removing ad-blocker warning.

Absolutely love it!
blocks ads, pop-ups, bitcoin miners, easily the best ad-blocker i've ever tried.
-------------------------
block
Really good extension! Blocks ads wonderfully and my pages load in just a matter of seconds!
-------------------------
block
This is still by far the best straight ad-blocker

‚Ä¢ It uses significantly less CPU and memory resources than ABP, AB or Adblock Edge (check the ¬µBlock github wiki page for benchmarks). The codebase is brand new, and openly developed on Github.

‚Ä¢ It blocks as well or better than these do.

‚Ä¢ It doesn't track you like AB does.

The developer is very friendly and active (as well as being open about his intentions), also check out his more detailed blocking extension, HTTPSwitchboard. An amazing extension!
-------------------------
block
It really is the best popup blocker and I'm taking into account every aspect of efficiency including speed, AI, interface, popups blocked, 'false positives', etc...
-------------------------
protect
after years of usage time after another uBlock keeps protect my internet usage and make my data saver. thank you ‚ô•

Constantly have to uninstall and reinstall it when it stops blocking ads randomly. Author has been ignoring these complains, and deletes these kinds of problem threads. When it works it is great....
-------------------------
block
This add on is great! It blocks every single ad on every single website I visit. Once it blocked up to 17 ads! I would recommend this to anyone, except my enemies because I want them to have the worst, because this is the best.
-------------------------

1st day ....after going on some popular sites and making my pc crash with some malwares ...i decided to download an ad block  ...downloaded opened the usual suspects and voila  my experience become free from adds and unwanted viruses and from wasting all this time closing annoying pop ups before chrome ask me to open the usual pdf/virus file ... i will update my review if anything new happen !!!until then i fully recommend it ...
-------------------------

Simply the best! Easy to use and it certainly blocks every anti-user mechanism. I've had no problems so far. Very good!
-------------------------
block
after several weeks of use, I'm free of ADD's !!!

additionally, it block webRTC IP leaking, very well done !!!

you are doing very well job, thanks for your help
-------------------------
block
Really happy with this so far. Has a better interface than ABP and has more options (e.g. $important, so I can override list exceptions, e.g. ||facebook.com$important to block all facebook.com content, overriding the EasyList exceptions. Seems a lot faster than ABP as well.
-------------------------
block
A great ad and tracking blocker, that lets the users define how much they want to block. 
A great way to only accept a minimal amount of ads that's not ridiculously annoying.
-------------------------
block
This is very helpful! I love it! It blocks all the ads on the websites I visit!
-------------------------
block
The settings are quite customizable and user friendly.The optimization for what is blocked on a page allows for precise targeting with great efficiency.
-------------------------
block
Does what it says on the tin. There are several different ad blocking extensions and programs out there, but this is the best one you can get from the Chrome Web Store due to it's great features and nearly undetectable impact on system performance across several devices.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block Youtube ads
-------------------------
block
blocks ads good
-------------------------
block
Blocks ads really well and speeds up the browser considerably.  Makes "smooth scrolling" better too.   Very good.
-------------------------
block
it does not block pop-ups.
-------------------------
block
One of the best out there, block any pop-ups or any harmful ads without much modification.
-------------------------
block
Really useful for the sites I frequently go to(they can't detect it so they can't block content).
-------------------------
block
The Best Ad Block EVER!!!
-------------------------
block
The most amazing ad blocking plugin ever made!
-------------------------
block
it does great job in blocking adds
-------------------------
block
Awesome!!! This is a MUST-HAVE extension.

I am an advanced user and have tried virtually every major ad and tracker blocker. 

Without hesitation, this is the best one for both blocking ads and trackers.

Whether you're an advanced or casual user, it gives you the amount of control that you want to take.  If a site is having problems because of blocked content, uBlock Origin makes it easy to fix it.

And if you mess up any of the settings, going back to default or unblocked is super easy.
-------------------------
block
The absolute best! It blocks ads and it's the least site-detectable of all rivals extensions! Don't take my word for it - add some adblock extensions and make a/b comparisons! The results will amaze you!
-------------------------
block
The greatest adblocker of all. Only complaint: the "strict tracking" blocks are a little on the annoying side, but the author's heart's in the right place.
-------------------------
block
This is a great chrome extension. Blocks advertisements and protects you from malicious websites.
-------------------------

It blocks more than ads. Much better than Ad Block Plus in blocking ads.Highly recommended.

Blocks ads very well. Extends laptop battery life when browsing.

Amazing,
Low on memory (RAM),
and blocks ads more than "Adblock"
-------------------------

Works really well and blocks all the ads
-------------------------

This AD blocker is very good you can even turn it off at times you need. It also blocks adverts from youtube which is amazing.
-------------------------
block
This app is Lean and Mean!! You can block it all or be selective on the ad content you do want to see. With provided filter lists it's a snap to set up and if you want to customize your experience, the uBlock Origin UI is a breeze for even the most novice of users. You'll notice this app has a five star rating with close to 8 million users. This one is worthy of a donation so show your love monetarily as well as a 5 star review.
-------------------------
block
Very effective in blocking all but embedded HTML ads.
-------------------------

Great extensions, does the job as supposed, it wont block 100% of adds on all sites , but close to 85-90% which is more than enough,
much thanks to the Devs.

Blocks all those annoying ads especially on YouTube. Love it
-------------------------

Oh, this is fantastic! In just three web pages, 35 ads were blocked, and the speed the web pages are loading is great! I use a lot of recipe pages, and they always have boatloads of ads.  My computer is not high-end, and low on RAM, so it's fast enough for pages without ads, but throw in those ads and things move at a snail's pace.  Thank you uBlock Origin/Raymond Hill for making this available.  Makes browsing so much better.
-------------------------
block
Literally the best ad blocker I have used. I tried a few, Got a new PC and didn't even bother with an ad blocker because sometimes they just didn't do anything. But this one is amazing blocks nearly if not all ads I have ran into :D Thanks for this! If you need a ad blocker download this!
-------------------------
block
The best adblocker on the market by far.

Very low memory footprint, properly block 95+% of ads, has custom ads blocking, UI is very intuitive if you need to activate ads for a specific website or change some settings.

What about AdBlock Plus? They are now selling whitelisting, so advertisers are paying to go through the adblocking. Screw that!

Thankfully uBlock Origin isn't doing any of that crap (so far), its record is 100% clean, perfect for me.
-------------------------
block
best add block ever supper recomended....keep up the work guyss loving it

Awesome extension,must have , beats adblocker and others,provides malware and ransomware protection for your browser..

Absolutely fantastic. Does exactly what it says: Blocks Ads.

THIS is the greatest popup blocker ever. I especially love the block element function! Right click any annoying element of a website even if it is not an ad, select "block element", select the wrapper html element  in the popup that shows up and enjoy the website without that SIGN UP HERE or whatever crap they are throwing at you!
-------------------------
block
BEST ad blocker...   MAKE SURE YOU ALSO INSTALL TAMPERMONKEY AND GET ANTI AD BLOCK KILLER
-------------------------

Some ads are going through and sometimes certain sites doesn't work if I don't disable it site gets messed up, hope the developer tries putting in something like Princeton's "perceptual ad blocker" in ublock origin, just check it out it's awesome. But right now they just detect not block. Hope somebody overcomes that.
-------------------------
block
Does not block YouTube ads as described.
-------------------------
block
The best out there compared to the likes of ABP. Effective blocking of trackers. Plenty of customisation options for advanced users.
-------------------------
block
Best adblocker, blocks all ads, also very lightweight compared to adblock/adblock+
-------------------------
block
Based on what I've read about this, including recommendations from web anonymity and security researchers, I'm glad to have it. I switched from Adblock which worked well (not perfectly) and I'm already appreciating uBlock's features. However, I knew it was going to be perfect when I saw it was from the same developer as uMatrix, which allows blocking of elements of a website based on type (script, cookie, image‚Ä¶) and/or source domain, and also uses lists to block all elements from ad/malware domains. It by default blocks certain elements from all external domains, although all default rules are fully editable. Speed and flexibility of the visual interface to change site rules is notable. This 'matrix' also allows us to see what is going on on the webpage- how many X from domain Y being allowed/blocked. Both uBlock and uMatrix are strongly recommended though uBlock for *everyone* and uMatrix if you're a technophile and/or especially care about minimising your footprint online. uBlock is for everyone because I don't think anyone likes ads, especially these days when they are more aggressive, even on very respectable websites. The reduced memory use and marketer tracking are two other major reasons, if you're not convinced.
-------------------------
block
Brilliant! Flexible and effective solution to block ads and whatever annoys you.
-------------------------
block
This app is perfect! It blocks EVERYTHING unlike FairAds By Stands.
-------------------------
block
A very good extension. Does a very good job blocking ads and the author clearly has the users' privacy in mind with no intention of selling out.
-------------------------
block
Good news, they have a feature where you can manually block ads!
-------------------------
block
best add blocking app
-------------------------
block
The option to block specific elements manually really puts this ad blocker a step beyond all the others, I highly recommend it!
-------------------------
block
Does a pretty great job! On occasion it does block legitimate pop ups though.. such as when opening an extra window on a product you're shopping for. This is very rare tho. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
This is the best adblocker out there. Not only does it block ads, but it also protects you from phishing sites and sites that might give you malware.

It‚Äôs very easy on the CPU; it doesn‚Äôt slow down my browser in the slightest.

I recommend this extension to you if you:
‚Ä¢ Are human
‚Ä¢ Use the Internet
-------------------------
block
Excellent, but I'd love to have a simpler way to enable/disable all blocking globally, though.
-------------------------
block
Absolutely the best ad blocking extension out there for Google Chrome!
-------------------------
block
dear uBlock Origin team
i love your services
pls contenues services always provide by your side this is very difficult bcoz your team block many company add but you great i am with you best team tnx for this master blaster app i see result 
tnx regard sanjay
-------------------------
block
Best ad blocking extension you can get.
-------------------------
block
Previously used AdGuard: this is marginally better performance-wise, but being open-source, without ulterior agenda, and both in addition to the core functions, makes this product the best available (at this time).

The Block Element feature could be improved but I haven't really needed to use it.
-------------------------
block
I have loved this extension for a really long time. Used to use Adblocker but this one is even easier to disable and enable, plus it seems to be more intuitive when blocking spam popups. <3
-------------------------
block
Best ad block ever! with less ram usage of course :p
-------------------------
block
The best there is, esp. the advanced setting + logging. 
Make manual blocking of certain stuff, also stuff like anti-adblocker scripts, a lot easier.
Combined with uMatrix a real power house.
-------------------------
block
This is a great addon it not only blocks annoying ads and popups it blocks redirects on websites to malicious content. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
awesome, blocks all the annoying ads
-------------------------
block
I didn't know about blocking to ad. Suddenly my one of the friends recommended this extension, I swear this extension is freaking good! U guys can enjoy about no more ad!!
-------------------------
block
This thing is amazing! I'm so used to it now, so I don't notice how good it is until I use someone else's device and I realize just how many things it has blocked for me, and if you need it to be disabled, piece of cake. A couple of clicks, and it's fine. 10/10. (Or 5/5 I guess :)
-------------------------
block
Blocks ALL ads. Much better than ABP!
-------------------------
block
Ad Blocker is clunky, the amount of times I've had slow loading of pages with "waiting for ad blocker" at the bottom and then I noticed it wasn't dealing with pop ups and letting YouTube ads through so I wondered what the point of it was.  Someone mentioned this on a friend's facebook thread so I went for it and I've never looked back.  It's pretty cool, no need to know lots of scripting and you can block certain parts of a page as well.  It's also great with shutting down those annoying new tab ads that certain sites have started doing now.
-------------------------
block
Best Adblocker ever. It blocks the ads other ones don't. Finally an adblocker that really works. Kudos..

PS: Hey Stephen Murad, do you have it turned om? lol
-------------------------
block
Possibly the best ad blocking extension there is for Web Browsers.
-------------------------
block
Very useful! It blocks YouTube ads, deceptive sites, and much more than AdBlock or other adblockers would! Open source. Highly, highly recommended!
-------------------------
block
great better than add block plus
-------------------------
block
finally, i had to learn how to use the various filters but in 5 to 10 min i finally got to view a site i love with out 50 pop ups blocking the view and love the "cosmetics" setting, thx soo much. 
to quote rick and morty:
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!!!
Ublock presented...
I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT!
GOOD JOB!!!

Outstanding software!  My trusty Ad-Block Plus was starting to get blocked on various sites.  I upgraded to this and it works flawlessly.  It also seems to have a much lighter footprint.
-------------------------
block
Please block ads on www.voot.com & www.hotstart.com

as well. These are Indian TV streaming websites. They load ads dynamically from there server.

Don't know how you guys might go around blocking but seriously if you guys do.....its a great achievement
-------------------------
block
You know that thing sites do when you have an adblocker? Where they ask you to turn it off?
I don't know what this blocker does to deflect that but it does it perfectly. 10/10 would block again
-------------------------
block
This is the best one I ever tried, adblock, adblock plus is hell, they dont block any ads and Browser so fast without adblock and  ublock dosen't need any memory.
-------------------------
block
"Adds by mgid" was messing with some site functions, it was blocking buttons. None of the malware software could deal with it, but ublock did it. The pages work as they were intended. I`m very impressed. Thank You very much. Very impressive work!
-------------------------
block
Definitely efficient, and greed free, but it's a blunt tool. If you accidentally block a crucial element and can't figure out how to undo the block, you have to deactivate the adblocker.

Which means Popups.

May rate higher when easier controls are added.
-------------------------
block
Since Adblock sold out, this is the best blocker I've seen (should have changed to this ages ago).

I've been using this for a while now and it's much better, blocks more efficiently annoying ads and performance is quite nice.

Extensive filter lists to choose from (defaults are fine without any addition).
Plus also same (and extended) "own filtering" as Adblock, which you can import.
-------------------------
block
Adblock betrayed me by giving me the ads that I wanted to remove. uBlock blocked them out right away without a hassle with much less memory space. I highly recommend it.
-------------------------
block
It's great! blocks every ads now
-------------------------
block
Great!

Open source!

Way better than AdBlock plus.

Love the little details. The little number of items blocked. and the clean pop down with more details.
-------------------------
block
It is a nice adblocker, I used to have adblock plus and they now SELL ADS exclusive to their users, therefore using them to milk out revenue. This adblocker is actually honest and isn't like abp. It is a adblocker but with way more features. it dosen't only block ads, but it blocks malware and tracking aswell.
-------------------------
block
Good ad block!
-------------------------
block
The best ad-blocking software. Easily modified in the options, with lots of custom blocking lists than can be used together.

Also didn't sell out like AdBlockPlus.
-------------------------
block
It works. It's light weight.

Summary- much better than Ad Block Plus.
-------------------------
protect
Currently the best content blocker around. Makes sites very much faster to load and protects your privacy. Very customizable and open source which is a plus.
-------------------------
block
This extension is great. It blocks ads silently and I don't have to worry about ads anymore.

-------------------------
block
An all-round excellent ad-blocker that still struggles with some very ad-heavy sites, and can be a little heavy-handed with the script blocking at times.
-------------------------
block
Originally got AdBlock+ because I wanted it to block ads. Since they want to play the oxymoron game, I got this instead, works like a charm.
-------------------------
block
Much better than other blocking solutions such as AdBlock, AdBlock+ (whitelisted some ads because money) et.c
-------------------------
block
It is the best. Open source and with advanced user mode, you can block scripts and other trackers. Plus it has a nice list of extra filters to choose from. Way better than ABP, which whitelists many ads from big companies, like Google and Microsoft
-------------------------
block
Blocks everything! love it
-------------------------
block
Love it, but there's some sites uBlock dones't block their ads, such as www.akoam.com
-------------------------
block
I used ADP for a long time but Facebook has recently taken measures to make ad blockers not work (August 2016). I decided to try uBlock and it worked to block the Facebook ads! 100% pleased with this extension. It did exactly what I wanted it to do. Thank you!
-------------------------
block
The best ad blocking extension out there. ABP < AB < uBlock Origin
-------------------------
block
It's like NBA game, and you blocks enemies' attacks all the time!
-------------------------
protect
Easy on cpu and RAM. Publishers don't do anything fishy. Comes with great web filters that protect your computer. I recommend it to anyone who asks.
-------------------------
block
very good extension for blocking
-------------------------
block
amazing
100 times beter and stronger than ad block and ADP 

and make pages load much much more faster without leaking local IP

love you !

release new version and make it even beter $$
BOOM
-------------------------
block
Switched from Adblock Plus which was a bigtime resource hog. uBlock Origin is much better. It is a resource-efficient, feature-rich and user-friendly ad blocker and privacy extension. I also disabled Disconnect since uBlock Origin has the ability to enable the same features Disconnect offers via blocking lists by Disconnect. I can now enjoy opening tabs again without much worrying about slowdowns. Not as stylish as Adblock Plus, but it does a better job. Cloud storage synchronization is also a cool feature.
-------------------------
detect
uBlock Origin helped me detect a rogue extension Imgur Uploader that was redirecting my clicked links to cityadspix.

Thanks and keep up the good work Mr gorhill.
-------------------------
block
Excellent. Could benefit from cookie blocking rules.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block all of the ads. Allows paid ads with no option to disable. BAD.
-------------------------
block
Not on my computer.  Which browser do you use?  I know it doesn't work well with UC Browser for PC because they have their own built in ad blocker.  But it works perfectly in Chrome, Firefox and Opera.  It blocks every ad in my browsers. It's 110x's better than ABP which was once my favorite.
-------------------------
block
really love this feature "Block media elements larger than"
-------------------------
block
Best content blocking extension on the planet.
-------------------------
detect
really awsome. my old adblocker was detected by sites this one dosent. love it
-------------------------
block
Really like it. The best I have found. What I really like is that you CAN block individual elements of a whitelisted site. 

I actually don't like to take away someone's bread and butter by blocking the ads. So I was looking for a filter to protect me from spyware and malware which they all do but I also wanted a way to block individual horrendously annoying elements easily which this does pretty well. The others don't let you do anything on a whitelisted site. This one does. This is important to me because I actually whitelist most sites.

Actually, I just tried it on a site, just on a large ad in the top right block. When you ad the filter it disappears, but each refresh brings another one back. 

I will still stick with this though. Out of 7 I tried, only one comes close to this. 

Maybe I really don't even need this though because I do not go to any "questionable" sites. It is comforting for first time visits.

Thank you for this fine piece of software.
-------------------------
block
good block
-------------------------
block
I love how many things this extension blocks! I disagree with the comments that say it's too aggressive. I run across all different kinds of websites and am constantly impressed by its ability to weed out what I don't want to see/pop-up from what I do. 

Only weird thing is that this morning, I got on Chrome and my extension was missing! I had to come reinstall it. I have no idea why it would suddenly no longer be in my Chrome anymore, since it was the last time I was online and I didn't uninstall it myself (it wasn't just disabled; it was completely missing and I had to re-add it to Chrome). Other than this weird mishap though, I'm greatly impressed!
-------------------------
block
Works great! Other ad blockers will still show ads on some websites and other stuff like that. But uBlock Origin blocks all ads. If you want to get rid of ads I HIGHLY recommend this.
-------------------------
block
This is probably the most flexible adblocking software I've ever used. Not only does it easily bypass adblock killers and allow you to pick elements to block, but it also has an extensive, fully customizable filter list. Overall, it's my personal favorite.
-------------------------
block
So far the best blocker I've ever used...and I used them ALL!  Pretty easy to understand.  Allows changes and exceptions. Disable pre-fetching (to prevent any connection for blocked network requests) Disable hyperlink auditing/beacon
Prevent WebRTC from leaking local IP addresses. Sweeeet :)
-------------------------
bypass
so far no issues, able to bypass forbes anti adblock
-------------------------
block
Its Good working.
Best ad-blocker. Extremely efficient and blocks everything
-------------------------
block
Best ad-blocker. Extremely efficient and blocks everything. Way better than the classic Adblock.
The best thing about this extension is that it still closes the popups if it failed to prevent them from opening! Keep it up.
-------------------------
block
Definitely better than AD Block ... I recommend it
-------------------------
block

The Best Ad Blocking Extension Better than the Original.
-------------------------
block
This ad blocker works better than any others I've tried. It blocks pop ups and pesky ads with ease. 5/7, perfect app.
-------------------------
block
Almost used every blocker but no one has the ability to block the adds. Randomly I found uBlock, this is One of the Best and most efficient ADD Blocker..
Say Bbye to other Add blockers and Use uBloack.
-------------------------
block
great app for blocking ads and more!
-------------------------
block
The best blocker out there! Blocks both ads and trackers, also it's easy on the RAM.
-------------------------
block
uBO does not open a tab itself just to tell you a site has been blocked, the tab is opened because the page you interacted with opened it. With other blockers the tab will also open, except that as opposed to uBO, they will not prevent the content from being loaded.
-------------------------
block
Keep up the good work, guys! This works far better than ADB+ ever did, and blocks essentially nothing that's not an ad. Cheers.
-------------------------
block
This extension is so much more than a simple AD Blocking add-on. 

- AdBlock Plus now lets through a lot of ads. You can get around that, but if you actually donated that doesn't unwound your psyche. 
- uBlock Origin does. uBlock Origin is the new warm blanket of intrusive Internet avoidance.
-------------------------
block
First time using this, and already blocking the unwanted ads, and other websites that decides to pop up, soo fast, but one thing that is suspicious is it says it also alternate with my privacy settings and maybe exploits things that shouldnt be but i dont know, maybe its just me, anyways 5 stars from me since it works perfectly
-------------------------
block
Does exactly what it says on the tin and does it well. Blocks ads/tracking elements reliably without interrupting other site content, integrates with the standard adblock filter formats used in other adblock extensions, provides an easy interface to custom-pick elements to create custom blocking rules without even needing to know the adblock script syntax. A must-have piece of the puzzle for convenience, privacy, and security concerns.

Also it was recommended by Taylor Swift on Twitter.
-------------------------
block
Best when it blocks all the advs screwing my live streaming of football matches. Thanks
-------------------------
block
it does what I want it to, I also find it easy to add new content to the block lists.
-------------------------
block
Love this extension, would be lost without him!
(especially element block)
-------------------------
prevent
best adblocker i've ever seen, and preventing to open malware site :)
-------------------------
block
- A frontline and essential part of my computer security preventing malware via rogue adverts.
- Makes sites that use third party advert services usable.
- Useful element blocking for removing invasive non-advert elements such as autoplay videos, fixed social-media buttons or newsletter sign-up popups.
-------------------------
block
Pure crap- blocks banner ads and such but does not stop the ones that open new explorer windows.
-------------------------
block
Great App does it job perfectly. Only question I have is can I use the uBlock filters(So those from the uBlock github) as well in another ad block program?
-------------------------
block
The best ad blocking extension available at the moment, much smaller memory footprint than other's I've tried and much more customisable if you want that.
-------------------------
block
FINALLY! hahaha this is actually the most decent blocker that I have encountered lol It tried to block all of the pop up ads that I have been getting.. I just hope for you to continue this consistency :) thankss
-------------------------
block
Blocks ads well (I rarely if ever see any now), and does so with good performance.
-------------------------
block
Absolutely brilliant, so many lists to choose from, better than ABP.  Can't recommend highly enough. Temporary unblocking is brilliant if you're online shopping etc.

Only missing feature is that you can't see exactly what has been blocked and what is allowed but if you turn advanced mode on you get some way towards showing this.
-------------------------
block
Better than all other adblockers I've tried.  uBlock Origin does the job perfectly and uses so little resources, you don't notice it being there.  It also starts up much faster in Chrome compared to the other popular adblockers.  Very rarely needs turning off, as 99.9% of sites work absolutely fine with it.  uBlock Origin also enhances privacy (not just by blocking ads), so another good reason to add it to Chrome.
-------------------------
protect
Both Adblock and Adblock plus have recently failed for me.

This software restores full protection from having my bandwidth hijacked for ads and other purposes that I both don't want and don't authorize.

The others are sellouts.
This open source. This is the real deal and closest to Noscript for chrome.

Best Ad blocking software I've used for Chrome.
-------------------------
block
This is way better than AdBlock since it has no conflict of interest & would block ALL ads. Thank you so much for developing this.
-------------------------
block
By far the absolute best ad blocker on any market. AdBlockPlus failed for years and had a clunky interface compared to uBlock Origin. Get this Ad Blocker because it really works! Works so good I can't say enough good things about it. Try it and find out for yourself. By default it adds a few good repositories but you can add more and they've done the work for you to, just check the ones you need added and Apply changes. Also comes with a eye dropper to block anything on screen. That was always an extension to AdBlockPlus. uBlock Origin all the way!
-------------------------
block
Was skeptical... but this is an excellent program. I thoroughly tested it with Youtube, and ya'al can get rid of Adblock for Youtube... if you guys even use it because this blocks those too! Thanks!
-------------------------
protect
3rd party lists add an additional layer of well needed protection
-------------------------
block
Lightweight, fast and blocks all the ads. The best adblocker So far.
-------------------------
block
Managed to block some frames that AdBlock could not. Cudos!
-------------------------
block
UPDATE: 3 stars because I have to enable it every time I start it up. Also, Twitch ads have started to slip through so that's pretty annoying.

Works extremely well and is very light on resources. I'm constantly impressed with ease of functionality and it's effectiveness in identifying and blocking not only ads but also malicious sites as well.

I find that this is currently the best ad blocker that I have used in Chrome. It blocks all of the ads for me in YOU-TUBE, which has proved useful when watching some of the longer documentary videos in there, and I find I have no problems with ads in Websites. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
Excellent utility. With proper adblock lists. Blocks out bad stuff.
-------------------------
block
Small and very fast.

The request grid feature is great to fine-tune blocked requests
-------------------------
block
Great adblock extension. My favorite feature is the toggling of certain filtering/blocking (i.e. cosmetic filtering, strict blocking, etc.) It makes it really helpful on sites that say turn off your adblock. Most of the time I toggle the cosmetic blocking and it doesn't even recognize the extension. Plus, it has a ton of filter lists to boot so it's my favorite and I've tried all of them.
-------------------------
block
loved it good add blocking
-------------------------
block
Best blocker out there. Fixed issues they used to have with playwire videos. Much better than the competition at block individual elements
-------------------------
protect
Read the explanation for the new permissions before rating. They are actually very well justified and giving the extra protection that was missing before.
-------------------------
block
Great problem. Does everything I need to block unwanted ads or pop ups. 

I was a little concerned about the new permissions until I read what they were and why they were needed.

This is a great program and I highly recommend it. :)
-------------------------
block
There are a few too many false positives (I just discovered that a Newsweek article was blocked to nothing but a blank page before disabling this for that site) but other than that it works great.
-------------------------
block
Awesome add blocker. Blocked over 500 ads over the course of 4 hours. Beautiful.
-------------------------

An excellent blocker that adds lots of extra protection with minimal intervention required.
-------------------------
prevent
Great, although sometimes prevents me from being able to click links on sites
-------------------------

Simple, and easy to use. Light on CPU usage, blocks ads like a charm, includes Block Element feature for other obtrusive elements if you need it. Perfect as is.
-------------------------

Did not block ads.
-------------------------

This is the best ad blocking plugin available. Low memory usage and does what it is supposed to, without a bunch of extra popups or clutter. I wouldn't browse without it.
-------------------------
block
Blocks quite a few legitimate elements. Not a whole lot, I'd guess maybe 5% of pages in my experience, but this is substantial considering Adblock Plus, its only other competitor, has never blocked legitimate content in my years of use.
-------------------------
block
Simply the best blocking and configuring for own blocks
-------------------------
block
The best Ad Block for all your web browsers!!! Chrome and Firefox!!
-------------------------

Great and fast little extension that really blocks ads!
-------------------------

Great success with both blocking and resource consumption. Recommended.

Fastest ad blocking extension out there. I'm amazed that at the same settings as competition, my Chrome is performing noticeably faster.
-------------------------
block
Blocks better than Adblock. Very fast.
-------------------------
block
The only extension I've reviewed. As soon as I saw that it could block page elements and REMEMBER them, I knew I had to leave a positive review. Much better on Memory than ABP. So glad I found this extension because it's easily my favorite. Now I don't have to see the stupid facebook chat I never use! :D
-------------------------
block
Works great, but I do have to agree with Connor W. who stated that it blocked things on Google Translate. It supposedly blocked about 15 ads as I translated a work and clicked on the "Listen" button. Other than that, it seems to work really well.
-------------------------
block
Excellent both for novice and for power users (the dynamic blocking popup as well as inspector are purely awesome). Also very impressive research behind performance and blocking.
-------------------------
block
It's pretty good ad block!
Thanx!
-------------------------
block
Very good addon, excellent! It blocks all adds and use keeps very low RAM memory usage when compared to old AddBlock addon. Very good this one is also OpenSource on github!
-------------------------
block
Fantastic adblock, easily the best, ever! It is VERY light weight, extremely customization with a ton of pre-configured block lists with support for your own, and specific element blocking. It's open source, with great documentation on GitHub! By far my favorite chrome/chromium extension, and I will continue to use it until the end of time.
-------------------------
block
Top marks for this ad blocking app, it really is the best in it's class. I would advise all Adblock(+) users to install ¬µBlock immediately. You'll notice that pages load like the speed of lightning as its far more efficient and doesn't require dumping 20megs of css rules into the DOM for every page and iframe :)
-------------------------
block
This is very good and blocks all ads!
-------------------------
block
Love how it block the ads. Not only that it's not a memory hag extension unlike the other extension that I have tried. 5*
-------------------------
block
My first AD blocker recommended by a friend which works great.  I even tried out the URL posted in David Mason's comment that uBlock blocked 3 ADs at this site so I am pleased with it.
-------------------------
block
ive tried like ten different adblockers and this one works the best it pre blocks tons of ads and u dont have to do it manually
-------------------------
block
Its fantastic. Uses less memory that Adblock and ABP whilst being as functional as both blockers. It does need better pop-up blocking though, so far so good
-------------------------
block
I love it. Works well and easy on memory. 

One thing I would like to see is the blacklist feature. I would love to have an abbility to only block web pages that are filled with ads.
-------------------------
block
Excellent! I don't notice the efficiency (I've got plenty of power to spare) difference, but why waste by using other services?

It's really simple to block specific elements, too, which is great. Easier to do so on ¬µBlock than it is on Adblock, I'd say.
-------------------------
block
still so many adds are not blocked
-------------------------
block
Like the memory usage however ads in Gmail aren't being blocked.
-------------------------
block
This is a very good blocker that needs refinement. It blocks too many non-ad fields, such as blanks to enter passwords and usernames. This app could be the best with tweaks, but AdBlock Plus remains the reference standard.
-------------------------
block
Really good! Seems to have increased my browsing speeds compared to AdBlock Plus. Also blocks all Ads which is awesome as well.
-------------------------
block
Very impressed so far. I didn't have many slowdown issues with Adblock (Adblock Plus was really problematic for me, plus sellout-concerns), but the ones I had this fixed.

I'm not quite sure I am on board with the default loadout of blocks, because I also run Ghostery and I suspect the privacy-related stuff is superfluous as a result. Still, a very good extension and heartily recommended.
-------------------------
block
I'm impressed at how well this works compared to Adblock/Adblock Plus. I'd just like to see the addition of whitelisting website and blocking elements manually.
-------------------------
block
Already works well and blocks ads/elements before page load (i.e, faster, more secure). Keep up the great work and looking forward to completed product.
-------------------------
block
gorhill is known for developing both ¬µBlock and the more powerful HTTP Switchboard extensions. ¬µBlock is more lightweight than its spiritual predecessor, featuring reliable blocking with minimal memory use. In its current state, ¬µBlock trumps alternatives in terms of UI, out-of-box list selection, and even performance, making it a clear all-around choice for users who desire sleek ad-blocking software.

Go to the Costco site by entering the URL in the address bar. If it blocks it do the following while still on that page... Just find the extension icon for Ublock Origin (on Chrome its under the puzzle looking piece unless you pinned it) LEFT Click on it Press the BIG Blue Power Button Now Click the Refresh Symbol that just appeared to the right of the Blue Power Button! If you are being redirected to sites it may block the site... Again you can turn off Ublock Origin from any site by doing what I described above. This is the best blocker out there! Its really easy to use, you will learn! Its Easy!

Good day. I have been using your adblocker for some time. What I also really liked is that I could watch TV on the internet on the website: nlziet.nl. So advertisements that you normally see on TV, that blocked ublock origin very well so that you could watch the entire broadcast without those annoying commercials. Only recently he no longer blocks broadcasts, so you now have to wait and those annoying advertisements see more. They may have removed something in the broadcast, so that your ad blocker will no longer see advertisements. It still works well on YouTube and other websites! Hopefully you can make something for it so that it will be blocked again. I would like to hear from you. Sincerely, Stefan Nieuwenhuijse

Twitch fairly recently changed how ads work on their site, they run within the stream itself now rather than as a separate overlay. I don't know of any filters right now that block every ad on twitch, some always get through. Usually you'll get an ad when you open the channel, and then as long as you have it open you shouldn't get any more. If that's how it is working for you then it's the best you're gonna get for now.

When updating filter lists, it shows the warning symbol next to every filter list, indicating that a network error prevented it from updating. Upon disabling uBlock for the extension site via the icon and pressing "Update now" again, everything updated successfully. Otherwise, awesome extension!

Hi, and thanks for the great extension :) I noticed that for the past week or so that, on a specific news website, UBO blocks all the ads and paywall (as it should) but it also prevent the site from loading images. It happens only on the front page; all secondary pages work fine with the extension. Not sure if it's been happening with other news portals or websites, but I thought I'd let you guys know. Website: https://www.estadao.com.br/ Thanks and keep up the great work!

The site http://www.metacritic.com/ is taking active measures to prevent UB from working. It's at least partly blocking UB from being called & when I can pull it up & block an ad it pops back up a minute later. It's an impressive effort, something I've not seen anywhere else.

Usually works perfectly, but it's allowing some ads on gmovies.is while using Chrome. It blocks them all just fine using Firefox. Not sure how they are getting through on that site. I haven't whitelisted anything. With all other streaming sites it works great...
-------------------------
block
Disclaimer: I'm just a happy uBO user, not developer. Shortly: Yes. Details: uBO blocks all known miners by default as any known abusive element on Internet. uBO creator made a separate lists called "uBlock filters -- Resource abuse" (on by default) specifically for such cases, miners are blocked based on address as any other unwanted resources like ads or tracking, there were no changes in UI. Of course, you can always add other lists if you like to white-list mining on a particular domain. See the list on GitHub: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/blob/master/filters/resource-abuse.txt Some early discussion about miners: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/690 If you'd like to allow mining in some cases and need a graphical UI for that, I'd try disabling the "Resource abuse" filter and using No Coin extension (I never used it myself, but it is surprisingly popular (4.74 stars and 70K+ users).
-------------------------

I noticed that uBlock allows the ads on some websites. The same version of uBlock is installed on Firefox, and it works perfect. For instance the website https://filmix.me/ shows side ads in Chrome, and doesn't show in Firefox, even if the settings and subscription filters are the same. Could you please explain why is this happening? How can I fix it? Even if I block it with "picker tool" it appears after page reload. Everything was tested on fresh-installed browsers, and no matter which version of uBlock is installed.

Dear gorhill, I'm a long time user of your extension and I really admire and appreciate your work on uBlock. The things I like the most about uBlock over other extensions are its performance, low memory usage and extensions to the EasyList grammar which makes it really powerful especially for blocking anti-adblock contents. Currently you are including some of your rules and replacement contents namely resources.txt, filters.txt and badware.txt as static assets as part of your extension itself. Since the replacement resources in resources.txt are highly effective in dealing with anti-adblock scripts, I'm wondering if you are willing to host them as part of other crowd-sourced filters like EasyList so that the community can contribute more replacement scripts for anti-adblock detection scripts and it could potentially be used by other extensions as well. Please let me know your thoughts on this suggestion. Thanks, K'vel

Websites use dynamic div and blend ads with content is quite a challange for uBlock to get rid of them, for example on http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ a few images managed to get through the filter.Any suggestions to block them without blocking the page content? Cheers and keep up the good work.

The auto-update works fine. Be sure nothing else is blocking the network requests uBO performs to fetch the remote filter lists.

uBlock Origin can block ads in Pandora, and Spotify Web flawlessly. It used to do the same with Google Play Music radio stations. That's not the case anymore, Google found the way to bypass uBlock Origin. If would be awesome if you fixed this. Thanks! I love this extension!

I installed a fresh version of uBlock, and it does not block everything by default. Check you custom filters -- and dynamic rules if you have any.
-------------------------
block
In uBlock's dashboard, go to the Statistics tab, and check "Enable the logging of network requests". From this point on, you will be able to inspect more closely the requests, blocked and allowed, made by a web page. There are currently opened issues to make the task of un-breaking pages more easy, so this is something which will be improved eventually.
-------------------------
block
If you are comfortable with dynamic filtering, this works: block 1st and 3rd party scripts. Pages load *much* faster on this site, and links work. Some widgets will be broken on it though, like comments section. But if you just want to read, this works all fine.
-------------------------

i've successfully used the filters function to block certain elements/images. it would be awesome if one could do this from a simple right click instead of going through the process of copying an image location and and manually adding to a filtered list. Awesome product otherwise.

It would be nice to see which elements on webpage are being currently blocked and which filter blocks them. In future releases it could really help people to make whitelists. Thank you!

Does anyone else deal with the blocker blocking the screens that pop up on YouTube when trying to unsubscribe or add something to a playlist? I would just disable the blocker but I also use it as my main ad blocker for YouTube. And if anyone has any ideas on how to fix that'd be cool. Love this blocker though, really good for getting into websites that either want an account or just have hundreds of popups.
-------------------------
popup
very good ad and popup blocker
-------------------------
popup
It works perfectly! It's heavily customizable and very versatile as not just an adblocker, but also a tool to hide various annoying prompts, like cookie prompts and newsletter signups. It even blocks pop-ups saying to disable adblockers. It also can be used to save data by blocking large things like autoplaying videos and 4K images, helping sites load faster and lowering the internet bills.
-------------------------
popup
Never got an ad ever in YouTube for a year now and I'm surprised and it works perfectly fine. It blocks every ads but there are some ads that still displays if you go into a sussy website but I don't rlly mind since it's on the side but it blocks annoying ads that are like fake messages, redirect popups suspicious links, popups, etc. This is the best adblock extension in my opinion.
-------------------------
popup
Simply put: this makes the internet usable again. Websites load much faster and you will no longer be caught in a web of endless popups and flashy banners. Raymond Hill, you are a true hero!
-------------------------
popup
The plugin works incredibly well, it completely blocks advertisements, tracking cookies like the little facebook icon, and all of the pop-ups that appear. Unlike some Adblocker programs, uBlock doesnt make exceptions to advertisements unless you specify (other adblockers allow advertisers to pay extra to allow their ads through the blocker). I have never had a problem with uBlock, there is no nonsense about it and it has a large team of people working on it. Since it's open-source, the entire program is public to read, so it is almost undoubtedly safe
-------------------------
popup
I find this to be the most reliable and easy to use of ad-blockers. No nonsense, and it really does a great job of blocking malicious websites and pop-ups. If anything it's too effective sometimes.

while I never needed it, I decided to get it and I don't regret it. I haven't had to deal with popups or adds on sites like YouTube and it feels much better to be able to look at something or watch something an be able to view it with not interruptions or annoyances. 10/10 would recommend

This is an adblocker I have been using for about 3 weeks now, and I just have to say that I love it. It's amazing, and works just fine for me. When I go to sites to watch dramas, they usually have a lot of pop-up ads. With this extension, it doesn't happen anymore. Same for youtube. I don't have to deal wit ads there anymore! There's also another website that I use to watch dramas. If anyone in here likes to watch kdramas/cdramas/jdramas/reality shows, you have definitely hear if Viki. I use the basic account, no Viki Pass/Viki Pass Plus, so I have to go through the ads and all. This adblocker actually blocks them all. Some inefficient ones can't go through Viki and Viki will usually tell you to turn off your adblocker. Howevere, this adblocker is just amazing. Anyways, I don't think theres any bad parts (not any yet, at least).

The best ad block extension I have ever used. Undetectable by pages that require whitelist, blocks all ads on pages, not only popups, but TrafficJunky and similar services as well. No more annoying ads on YouTube, Twitch.tv and similar pages. Custom rules, filters, whitelists, IP blocks, everything can be edited in HTML as well as be transferred across clients and platforms (for advanced users and developers). Extension is supported on GitHub as well. I absolutely love it! 5 stars!

uBlock is extremely effective. It blocks all ads before YouTube videos, during Spotify jam sessions, and on those sites that are normally covered in pop-ups. It has not slowed my computer or browsing experience at all, and I am very satisfied with its performance.

Switched from adblock plus over to this and all I can say is its even better!!! I should have made the switch years ago, this literally blocks ALL popups. There were certain sites that even adblock plus failed to block but this extension is amazing!!!

uBlock Origin is a fantastic ad-blocker; it's the only one I use. Easy on system resources, and 100% effective against blocking ads and tracking scripts. The pop-up interface is straightforward and customizing the extension's settings is very easy. Highly recommend.

OMG - after months of trying various other extensions and solutions to block ads and pop-up JW Player videos this worked like magic "out of the box". A BIG thank you to the developers.
-------------------------
popup
Absolutely the best ad blocker out there. Lets you have complete control over what ads are there, and if one does come up that it misses, just use the element zapper to make it disappear. Works well even on YouTube! Would suggest to anybody that hates ads and annoying popups.
-------------------------
popup
I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.
-------------------------

I could never go back to how horrible the web was before ad-blockers, with pop-ups and blinking banner-ads everywhere. Now all is clean and nice. Web developers need to make advertising less intrusive or people will always block ads.

Good job to the team behind this and thanks a ton!

This is a great addon it not only blocks annoying ads and popups it blocks redirects on websites to malicious content. Highly recommended.

Definitely efficient, and greed free, but it's a blunt tool. If you accidentally block a crucial element and can't figure out how to undo the block, you have to deactivate the adblocker.

Which means Popups.

May rate higher when easier controls are added.
-------------------------
popup
For the moment, this add-on seems to be really better than Adblock. For a long while now I started to have annoying pop-ups passing through Adblock. I tried Ublock (first heard about it today in a FB comment) and no more annoying pop-up!!! With Adblock being sold outs now, this is a great alternative!

Ads is not a problem that this extension solves... generally it helps to deal with unrequested embeddables.
A single blog website may contain 20-30 of them and you can safely turn off 80% of that stuff to reduce requests to external sources without losing visual experience.(marketing SaaS and social networking widgets, tracking scripts)
I use it paired with uMatrix and it provides full control over traffic (with system-wide firewall of course).
This tool can help you to become a bit more tech-savvy. You will learn to understand what a single webpage consist of, what type of sources are necessary, how CDN works and how many steps it takes for youtube video to be displayed on a website. You'll have to tune settings for each favorite website. It's all not much harder than learning TV remote, so you can adjust your web experience and consume content in your own way.
-------------------------

Best ad-blocker. Extremely efficient and blocks everything. Way better than the classic Adblock.
The best thing about this extension is that it still closes the popups if it failed to prevent them from opening! Keep it up.

Version 1.31.0 is not allowing me to delete emails from mail.yahoo.com. I can move emails to both the spam and trash folder but it is blocking the popup that asks if I want to delete all emails in that specific folder. I am using both Chrome and Brave. Same issue on both browsers. This has not previously been an issue on either browser. Otherwise I like the blocker very well. My workaround is to cut it off when I need to delete emails. Thanks for all you do!
-------------------------
popup
Yes. I have used it for over a year on FireFox without any issues. I just reinstalled Chrome after several years and I considered this extension mandatory against popups (I also use ABP). Also, it is very easy to use.

Adding an exception "@@|| aliexpress.com ^ $ popup" to "My Filters" helped after restarting the browser. Thank you.
-------------------------

Thats a really good suggestion. I'd prefer it to behave this way too. The popup could explain everything and then let the user decide.
-------------------------
popup
I know that you have given us the per-site popup blocker button but would it be possible for you to give us an option to enable the popup blocker for all websites by default? I would rather selectively enable popups than to disable them for each sites. Your extension is truly the one and only. It gives us the total control of scripts unlike anything on the Chrome store.

STOPPED WORKING ON GOOGLE.COM AND GMAIL.COM
blocks the body of emails and won't display them properly.
apart from that, it's the best ad blocker along with ABplus
Thanks
-------------------------
stop
Problem right now Mar 2022, it is stopping Gmail from working properly. You can log in ok, but emails will not display. Turn uBlock off and all is ok.

On the whole, it is very good. It is detected by some sites & impedes performance, mainly free to air TV sites who run ads, so you just turn it off for those sites (I use a different app for those sites, which is undetected).

It works perfectly! It's heavily customizable and very versatile as not just an adblocker, but also a tool to hide various annoying prompts, like cookie prompts and newsletter signups. It even blocks pop-ups saying to disable adblockers. It also can be used to save data by blocking large things like autoplaying videos and 4K images, helping sites load faster and lowering the internet bills.
-------------------------

Seriously, I thought this was going to be one of those extensions that would break easily! This surprisingly works great and doesn't disappoint, now I can watch all my shows without millions of ads in my face!

its no longer blocking any ads

or much of anything, the only thing it stops is spam pop up websites

nvm did a reinstall and it works fine now

This is the type of adblocker you'd be happy to pay for!
After Adblock went out of style I tried Opera's built in extension but it still did not stop pop ups, new tabs, and overlays. After a 12 months of suffering I found this the other day. Brilliant. Not a single ad to be seen anywhere.
-------------------------
load
this extension is a good adblocker, <strikethrough> but there isn't an option to disable it on all sites, which is annoying if it is forced to be on your computer because it does slow down page loading. </strikethrough> edit: this comment was made before an update. It's good now.

Simply put: this makes the internet usable again. Websites load much faster and you will no longer be caught in a web of endless popups and flashy banners. Raymond Hill, you are a true hero!

The fact that it broke and I realized exactly how much it was blocking before I repaired it made me come here specifically to give it a 5 star review. amazing blocker.

Perhaps the only adblocker that works perfectly with Amazon.com without breaking it! It blocks those pesky sponsored posts and the added "Element Picker Mode" allows you to block whatever else annoys you on Amazon's Home Page. Simply fantastic!

This is actually so good, just need to right click on what I wanted to delete and highlight it and boom gone permanently and if I needed to get a part back, I can just go into the my filters and delete it from there and I learned all this just a few minutes ago when this post was made, so I highly recommend anyone who has that annoying feature on their favourite site or for any ads (which this does automatically), this is very good indeed. (Edit): When it stopped blocking ads I just reinstalled and that did the job, until they update that's probably the way to fix the issue. And you can import anything you want removed.

Dear Raymond Hill,

This adblocker... is unlike any adblocker I've ever seen. One time when I was on PowerPoint Mobile online, I saw that Ublock Origin blocked 103 ads on that page. That's insane. The adblocker I had before this adblocker was called Adblocker - Stop Ads on Every Site. This adblocker didn't even block ads on YouTube!!! But this one does. That's very convenient for me and is AWESOME to see. I love your product, man!!! ‚ù§
-------------------------
stop
This was my favourite ad blocker for years and it still mostly works without problem. However, it's been some time since it stopped blocking YT ads.

It has stopped blocking Youtube Ads

This extension is just amazing. Not only does it block all ads, not only does it stop those annoying youtube search settings/recommendations that aren't even related to your actual search, but it's also just amazing given that this is free.

Honestly this is the only ad-block that full works on youtube and other sites, at one point it looked like it got hacked and I just found that out today because there was some other adblock keeping the video player from loading on one of the kdrama sites I use but I reinstalled this version after searching for it again and it's working perfectly. I've used this version for years and it's the only one that honestly works.

I've been using uBlock Origin for years and it's the best ad blocker out there! It blocks every single kind of ad aggressively. Pages even load much faster as a result, I also love the element blocking feature. BTW, great job! much more than an ad blocker!

In my opinion, and many reviews aswell, best adblocker which reduces website load times the most, while also being the most efficient and using least memory and CPU resources. Awesome!
-------------------------

I would've given it 5 stars before the update on November 27. Now when the extension is enabled no website will load. Until this is fixed I unfortunately cannot recommend this anymore.

EDIT: it's working again! Fully recommend this extension

Pretty good adblocker until it stopped blocking ads on Youtube and Twitch.
-------------------------

You should really give it 5 stars not 1 star if you've used it for so long and relied on it to stop twitch ads. Show some support perhaps they'll fix it and you'll carry on taking advantage of this amazing plugin.

Beware of imitators (Google / Chrome apparently don't care to stop them). This is the real deal and one of the few relatively "safe" ways to use a web cluttered with ads and malware.

I've used this extension for years and I love it.  Continues to work and stops 99.9% of the ads you don't want to see.  And whitelisting sites that detect an ad blocker is easy to do as well.

Used to work perfectly until about a week ago. Now it prevents any web page from loading at all when enabled, but only on my laptop. I have to disable it in chrome for any site to load at all. My desktop (my chrome is synced so all extensions are the same) works perfectly with ublock enabled. I'm hoping this is just an issue with a recent update to either the extension or to my laptop that will get resolved because the extension is fantastic and has been for years.

Ublock Origin works flawlessly for the most part. Low CPU usage and perfect ad blocking, however as of the time of this review Twitch.tv stream  have been loading extremely slowly and buffering often whilst the blocker was on.

-------------------------
access
I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.

This is the best aadblock no doubt about it, and the function to block specific elements from loading in a specific webpage is a very useful tool.

Best adblocker to date, it has all the lists built in that you can choose from, it also seems to be the fastest, most efficient, and therefore uses less battery when I'm using a laptop.  I had to stop using Adblock Plus because the battery drain on laptops was absolutely terrible.  Thank you Raymond Hill (gorhill)!
-------------------------
access
Reliable, Fast and and thorough! uBlock Origin is seriously one of the best add-ons you can get for a browser and should be running on everyone's internet browser. It doesn't get in your way and block the websites you want to access [unless they're actually malicious] like other AdBlocker services do.
-------------------------
access
Just one of the best browser security tool, period. You cannot imagine just how some attacks are sophisticated nowadays and deployed on a large scale. Some of the nastiest malware are distributed on webservers and with javascript we leave the door open. Also thumbs up for the performance and customization available.

Install this on every browser you access. Make the world safer.

i dont usually review things from the webstore but i just had to for this one. i tend to go to many site, from vape to gaming and this extension is amazing. any NEGATIVE REVIEW about blocking everything either are lazy or expect the extension to do everything for them. heres a little fact upon right clicking the extension you go into setting and you can set everything like you want it and how you want it even setup a WHITELIST to prevent the extension from blocking whatever site you want. the extension does exactly they say it should do and i highly recommend it been using it for more than 2+ years and i wont stop using it...

I used ADB for years, but it stopped working and the performance hit was always meh. I'm very happy with uBlock Origin -- strong filters, strong performance.

I have been a long time user of this extension and it has never failed me yet. I highly recommend this to everyone who wants to get rid of annoying ads and banners. I also recommend getting the "uBlock Protector" extension so you stop getting anti-adblock warnings when visiting websites.

Ad Blocker is clunky, the amount of times I've had slow loading of pages with "waiting for ad blocker" at the bottom and then I noticed it wasn't dealing with pop ups and letting YouTube ads through so I wondered what the point of it was.  Someone mentioned this on a friend's facebook thread so I went for it and I've never looked back.  It's pretty cool, no need to know lots of scripting and you can block certain parts of a page as well.  It's also great with shutting down those annoying new tab ads that certain sites have started doing now.

Please block ads on www.voot.com & www.hotstart.com

When I finally ditched Adblock, replacing it with uBlock Origin and uBlock Origin WebSocket, my 64-bit Chrome installation revved up from wallowing to absolutely screaming, the way Google intended Chrome to be.  

What I found particularly refreshing is that I can now have nearly unlimited tabs open without slowing down my computer at all.  I strongly suspect the "memory problem" some people say Chrome has isn't due to Chrome itself but a pile of interactive ads that used to load in each and every tab.

With the uBlock Origin pair of extensions, my browsing experience has been restored to "Absolutely Stellar."

uBO does not open a tab itself just to tell you a site has been blocked, the tab is opened because the page you interacted with opened it. With other blockers the tab will also open, except that as opposed to uBO, they will not prevent the content from being loaded.

I've been using AdBlock for a year and finally switched due to my subscriptions not loading properly in YouTube. Well this extension fixed all of that and Chrome runs quite a bit faster now.

Wow this is amazing!  This even made my page loading faster vs adblock.  This is awesome!

Top marks for this ad blocking app, it really is the best in it's class. I would advise all Adblock(+) users to install ¬µBlock immediately. You'll notice that pages load like the speed of lightning as its far more efficient and doesn't require dumping 20megs of css rules into the DOM for every page and iframe :)

It's good;  And its definitly quite a bit faster.  Howerver it breaks a lot of websites.  If you're not paying attention or not thinking about it, the web page you're looking for won't be loading or won't be working properly; and this guy is the culprit.

Definitely light on CPU and works great except when it works too great.

uBlock Origin seems to be blocking not just ads, but the YouTube videos themselves from loading.

this is a weird issue. it only started happening last night. When I open Chrome and navigate to any webpage it'll lock out - just stay on an eternal loading screen. Once it locks out, it'll also lock out trying to load a page that doesn't require the internet, like Chrome's settings. Checking Windows Task Manager shows one of the Chrome processes exploding with CPU usage. Force closing it disables uBlock, and webpages then load like normal. Reloading uBlock manually keeps everything functioning as normal, until I close and reopen Chrome again - the process repeats. idk what's changed. My uBlock is up to date, as is my Chrome.
-------------------------

When I visit my website with your extension enabled, none of my local fonts load. When I disable it, everything loads fine. Why is that? And how can I fix this on my end?

any issue with specific web sites need to be reported at https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues#, along with all details of how a volunteer can reproduce the issue, so that this can be investigated and fixed. I loaded primewire.ag in Chrome and it seems to work just fine when using uBlock Origin's default settings. Be awere that web sites may changed their code and in such case volunteers need to craft new filters.

bug
This is no bug in uBO, there is nothing to fix. Change the order of installation of uBO and Ghostery, and the warning will be for the other extension. Read the explanation, it explains this is a Chrome warning, there is no harm otherwise.

Thank you very much for your replay BilBg, Great respect for your wonderful work regardin uBlock Origin. I don't have to post here the lists witch are not checked, because those ones show "0 used of XXXX" too. These are the "0 used of XXXX" checked lists: 1. Fanboy‚Äôs Enhanced Tracking List (forums.lanik.us): 0 used out of 909 2. Fanboy‚Äôs Social Blocking List (forums.lanik.us): 0 used out of 12,864 But tell me please, if i will use Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List I can uncheck all those above 7 lists from the first post? Is it a good idea, considering: 1.hardware resources used by loading the lists 2.how often is Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List updated compared with the 7 lists? 3. Number of lines included in Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List compared with the 7 lists. Many appreciations for you excellent work with the uBlock Origin. Warm regards.

Try this URL instead: http://hosts-file.net/download/hosts.txt There were invisible unicode characters in your URL which caused the remote server to fail.

If you are comfortable with dynamic filtering, this works: block 1st and 3rd party scripts. Pages load *much* faster on this site, and links work. Some widgets will be broken on it though, like comments section. But if you just want to read, this works all fine.

I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.

Problem right now Mar 2022, it is stopping Gmail from working properly. You can log in ok, but emails will not display. Turn uBlock off and all is ok.

This is an adblocker I have been using for about 3 weeks now, and I just have to say that I love it. It's amazing, and works just fine for me. When I go to sites to watch dramas, they usually have a lot of pop-up ads. With this extension, it doesn't happen anymore. Same for youtube. I don't have to deal wit ads there anymore! There's also another website that I use to watch dramas. If anyone in here likes to watch kdramas/cdramas/jdramas/reality shows, you have definitely hear if Viki. I use the basic account, no Viki Pass/Viki Pass Plus, so I have to go through the ads and all. This adblocker actually blocks them all. Some inefficient ones can't go through Viki and Viki will usually tell you to turn off your adblocker. Howevere, this adblocker is just amazing. Anyways, I don't think theres any bad parts (not any yet, at least).

Literally the most amazing adblocker. Started using it in 2019. Absolutely amazing. Never once had a problem. Only complaint is that some ads aren't blocked but since there is a manual element blocker it's practically not a complaint but a TINY flaw which is fine. Nothing's perfect.

AdBlock is a grandchild of uBlock Origin. uBlock Origin is the original program that Adblock was built off of since it was a free open source code at first. But take heed, take notice that Adblock is often confused with AdGuard. 

AdGuard is a program, not an extension of your browser, and it monitors and profits from sitting in the background as a separate program and eyeballs ALL the sites you visit, keeping a record and roster of each one, then sells that information to ad marketing groups. 

That is why, if you notice, uBlock Origin and AdBlock sit on the side as merely an extension of your browser (posting an icon in the upper right hand corner of your browser window) and does not hijack a list of monitored internet sites you visit like AdGuard does. AdGaurd tries to fraudulently deceive you around the point by claiming they protect off line content too within various apps, but all that means in real life is that they do that to get a list of your total computer activity, not just your internet browsing activity. AdGaurd is not a malicious program, but do not be deceived, IT IS AN INVASIVE PROGRAM!

Also, if you get use to using uBlock Origin you will see that they have settings in their control icon where you can block a pages' media data and what-not else, but you can also turn that off and be free to use media players and such on specific sites. You just have to tell it what to do. uBlock is by far the best out there right now IMHO if you include privacy, trust, and genuineness in their agreement with users.

The best ad-blocker I've tried. I particularly like how easy it is to turn on or off. There are some sites I don't want to block the ads for, such as when I'm watching a YouTuber who depends on ad revenue. uBlock remembers which sites you don't want to block the ads for as well, so you don't have to remember to switch it back on or off.

This from my experience is the greatest ad block extension available, you can filter for what you want manually, or add in bulk by copying filter lists, allowing for great versatility over other ad block software I've tried, it's also a relatively light extension as far as high end ad block extensions come, so that's another big plus, I can't fault Ublock-Origin at all, it's a must.

This is 100% my favorite extension. Firstly, it does its job, and does it very well. Secondly, it stays fast no matter what page I use it on, and if the page wants me to turn off adblock, I'll just leave. Finally, you shouldn't mistake looks for function. This extension works like a charm and it does everything it said it was going to do. Thanks for this, it's made my browsing much better.

ot perfect but still pretty great. One feature that it doesn't have that you really would think it would, is a way to toggle filtering on/off. There is a (very easy) way to turn it off/on for a website or an individual page, but not altogether... which occasionally (or 10 times a day, in my case) means having to go into your extensions and manually turning off the entire extension then re-enable it etc. For such a well-thought out extension, I don't see why this was overlooked.

Ads is not a problem that this extension solves... generally it helps to deal with unrequested embeddables.
A single blog website may contain 20-30 of them and you can safely turn off 80% of that stuff to reduce requests to external sources without losing visual experience.(marketing SaaS and social networking widgets, tracking scripts)
I use it paired with uMatrix and it provides full control over traffic (with system-wide firewall of course).
This tool can help you to become a bit more tech-savvy. You will learn to understand what a single webpage consist of, what type of sources are necessary, how CDN works and how many steps it takes for youtube video to be displayed on a website. You'll have to tune settings for each favorite website. It's all not much harder than learning TV remote, so you can adjust your web experience and consume content in your own way.

Better than all other adblockers I've tried.  uBlock Origin does the job perfectly and uses so little resources, you don't notice it being there.  It also starts up much faster in Chrome compared to the other popular adblockers.  Very rarely needs turning off, as 99.9% of sites work absolutely fine with it.  uBlock Origin also enhances privacy (not just by blocking ads), so another good reason to add it to Chrome.

Great adblock extension. My favorite feature is the toggling of certain filtering/blocking (i.e. cosmetic filtering, strict blocking, etc.) It makes it really helpful on sites that say turn off your adblock. Most of the time I toggle the cosmetic blocking and it doesn't even recognize the extension. Plus, it has a ton of filter lists to boot so it's my favorite and I've tried all of them.

Go to the Costco site by entering the URL in the address bar. If it blocks it do the following while still on that page...

uBlock Origin seems to be blocking not just ads, but the YouTube videos themselves from loading.

this is a weird issue. it only started happening last night. When I open Chrome and navigate to any webpage it'll lock out - just stay on an eternal loading screen. Once it locks out, it'll also lock out trying to load a page that doesn't require the internet, like Chrome's settings. Checking Windows Task Manager shows one of the Chrome processes exploding with CPU usage. Force closing it disables uBlock, and webpages then load like normal. Reloading uBlock manually keeps everything functioning as normal, until I close and reopen Chrome again - the process repeats. idk what's changed. My uBlock is up to date, as is my Chrome.

Hi, I've discovered your extension thanks to Martin's post on ghacks.net; great work, I really like it. Two questions/suggestions: 1. Could you add an overview of all whitelisted (I mean: whitelisting by clicking the enable/disable button in the drop down menu) sites to the settings? What would be even better: an option to import/export those filters. 2. It would be nice to be able to globally enable/disable the filtering (without having to disable the whole extension). Sometimes I want to browse multiple sites without adblockers and it's much easier to temporarily pause filtering globally than to turn it off (and then on back again later on) for each site separately. Thanks for your effort! Simon

Ublock has been a nice reliable and customizable blocker over the years. There is more power there than I need. The best features are the automated ones and ability to right clock block elements since most people aren't going to spend a lot of time figuring out complex options.

PLEASE add ability to easily block entire sites. Look at all the low quality site blocker/time management apps people download. Ublock could be getting some of that traffic by simply add in the ability to block entire sites or even add in time periods to block sites at certain times as these are SUPER easy options compared to the other coding the developers have done to filter out specific elements. A nice right click block entire site option would be nice.

This is actually so good, just need to right click on what I wanted to delete and highlight it and boom gone permanently and if I needed to get a part back, I can just go into the my filters and delete it from there and I learned all this just a few minutes ago when this post was made, so I highly recommend anyone who has that annoying feature on their favourite site or for any ads (which this does automatically), this is very good indeed. (Edit): When it stopped blocking ads I just reinstalled and that did the job, until they update that's probably the way to fix the issue. And you can import anything you want removed.

This extension is useful for many things, not just ad blocking. For instance, if I want to take a screenshot of a webpage, I can use the thunderbolt icon to remove elements from a webpage I don't want, then take the screenshot. 
You can remove elements aside from ads.

I don't really use ublock for adblock, I mainly just use it to block malware (enabling the malware lists and unbreak filters) and remove elements as I see fit. It's good for this purpose because of its excellent customizability.

uBlock Origin has been the king of adblocking on Chrome for years now, and for very good reason. It's efficient and provides sane defaults, all while allowing power users to customize everything as they see fit.

The cloud storage support is also one of the top features to note, allowing you to easily synchronize all your filters, rules and whitelists across different machines.
-------------------------
filter
I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.
-------------------------
filter
It has worked perfectly for me so far. Not a single ad has gone through in my time using it. The element zapper is pretty fun to mess around with for a few minutes. The large selection of filters is also nice.
-------------------------
list
Best adblocker to date, it has all the lists built in that you can choose from, it also seems to be the fastest, most efficient, and therefore uses less battery when I'm using a laptop.  I had to stop using Adblock Plus because the battery drain on laptops was absolutely terrible.  Thank you Raymond Hill (gorhill)!

Best adblocker hands down, it has all the lists built in that you can choose from, it also seems to be the fastest, most efficient, and therefore uses less battery when I'm using a laptop.

This from my experience is the greatest ad block extension available, you can filter for what you want manually, or add in bulk by copying filter lists, allowing for great versatility over other ad block software I've tried, it's also a relatively light extension as far as high end ad block extensions come, so that's another big plus, I can't fault Ublock-Origin at all, it's a must.
-------------------------
filter
It's simply great! Switched to it after ABP and never regretted. Simple to set up and use with a bunch of built-in 3rd party filters. My kudos to devs for all their generous efforts keeping such a feature-rich app up-to-date and ABSOLUTELY FREE!!!

Please add syncing to whitelists, and please add option for blacklisting instead of whitelisting. But syncing is definitely more important.

Otherwise very grateful for this extension.

This is an insanely great add-on.

Also, enable cloud sync if you have custom filters and use the same filters everywhere.

i dont usually review things from the webstore but i just had to for this one. i tend to go to many site, from vape to gaming and this extension is amazing. any NEGATIVE REVIEW about blocking everything either are lazy or expect the extension to do everything for them. heres a little fact upon right clicking the extension you go into setting and you can set everything like you want it and how you want it even setup a WHITELIST to prevent the extension from blocking whatever site you want. the extension does exactly they say it should do and i highly recommend it been using it for more than 2+ years and i wont stop using it...

Best adblocker out there. Doesn't use too much resources, has plenty of filters to protect you, and blocks ALL ads. Really simple design too.

Really happy with this so far. Has a better interface than ABP and has more options (e.g. $important, so I can override list exceptions, e.g. ||facebook.com$important to block all facebook.com content, overriding the EasyList exceptions. Seems a lot faster than ABP as well.

Improves Chrome performance because of the minimal resource footprint. It works great out of the box, but for experienced users, uBlock Origin provides extremely granular filtering of web content. Opensource. Two thumbs up!

I used ADB for years, but it stopped working and the performance hit was always meh. I'm very happy with uBlock Origin -- strong filters, strong performance.
I'm a big fan of its ability to pause links that redirect you to ad middlemen. A normal and rarely dangerous thing, but it's nice to have full control over my browser.

Does exactly what it claims. It also allows you specify individual page elements to add to your blacklist. It's extremely easy to use and seems fairly light on system resources. Couldn't have asked for much more.

This app is Lean and Mean!! You can block it all or be selective on the ad content you do want to see. With provided filter lists it's a snap to set up and if you want to customize your experience, the uBlock Origin UI is a breeze for even the most novice of users.

The best adblocker on the market by far.

Very low memory footprint, properly block 95+% of ads, has custom ads blocking, UI is very intuitive if you need to activate ads for a specific website or change some settings.

What about AdBlock Plus? They are now selling whitelisting, so advertisers are paying to go through the adblocking. Screw that!

Thankfully uBlock Origin isn't doing any of that crap (so far), its record is 100% clean, perfect for me.
-------------------------

ot perfect but still pretty great. One feature that it doesn't have that you really would think it would, is a way to toggle filtering on/off. There is a (very easy) way to turn it off/on for a website or an individual page, but not altogether... which occasionally (or 10 times a day, in my case) means having to go into your extensions and manually turning off the entire extension then re-enable it etc. For such a well-thought out extension, I don't see why this was overlooked.
-------------------------

Incredible. Highly customizable, allowing you to select which adblocking lists you want to use, or even create your own. None of this bribery from global conglomerates in exchange for whitelisting BS, like Adblock Plus has done.

Based on what I've read about this, including recommendations from web anonymity and security researchers, I'm glad to have it. I switched from Adblock which worked well (not perfectly) and I'm already appreciating uBlock's features. However, I knew it was going to be perfect when I saw it was from the same developer as uMatrix, which allows blocking of elements of a website based on type (script, cookie, image‚Ä¶) and/or source domain, and also uses lists to block all elements from ad/malware domains. It by default blocks certain elements from all external domains, although all default rules are fully editable. Speed and flexibility of the visual interface to change site rules is notable. This 'matrix' also allows us to see what is going on on the webpage- how many X from domain Y being allowed/blocked. Both uBlock and uMatrix are strongly recommended though uBlock for *everyone* and uMatrix if you're a technophile and/or especially care about minimising your footprint online. uBlock is for everyone because I don't think anyone likes ads, especially these days when they are more aggressive, even on very respectable websites. The reduced memory use and marketer tracking are two other major reasons, if you're not convinced.

Dropped Adblock and Adblock plus. No matter what those extensions did not filter harmful clickbait and hidden ads on certain sites. This does the trick. Even if the downloaded list of filters doesn't catch everything, it's built in element picker (which lets you get rid of elements on a webpage) catches everything and anything. 
Honestly, adblocker and its plus cousin had faulty element pickers which is why I dropped them. This is light weight, effective and more efficient. Thank you!

Since Adblock sold out, this is the best blocker I've seen (should have changed to this ages ago).

I've been using this for a while now and it's much better, blocks more efficiently annoying ads and performance is quite nice.

Extensive filter lists to choose from (defaults are fine without any addition).
Plus also same (and extended) "own filtering" as Adblock, which you can import.
-------------------------
list
The best ad-blocking software. Easily modified in the options, with lots of custom blocking lists than can be used together.

Also didn't sell out like AdBlockPlus.

Much better than other blocking solutions such as AdBlock, AdBlock+ (whitelisted some ads because money) et.c
-------------------------

It is the best. Open source and with advanced user mode, you can block scripts and other trackers. Plus it has a nice list of extra filters to choose from. Way better than ABP, which whitelists many ads from big companies, like Google and Microsoft

Easy on cpu and RAM. Publishers don't do anything fishy. Comes with great web filters that protect your computer. I recommend it to anyone who asks.

Switched from Adblock Plus which was a bigtime resource hog. uBlock Origin is much better. It is a resource-efficient, feature-rich and user-friendly ad blocker and privacy extension. I also disabled Disconnect since uBlock Origin has the ability to enable the same features Disconnect offers via blocking lists by Disconnect. I can now enjoy opening tabs again without much worrying about slowdowns. Not as stylish as Adblock Plus, but it does a better job. Cloud storage synchronization is also a cool feature.

quite fantastic really.. tho i must admit even with the serious increased filter options which is very nice... i honestly dont see it being any faster compared to the normal adblock extension...

Well at least ublock does not have whitelisting like adblock does :) so im happy with this extension for now.
-------------------------
filter
Really like it. The best I have found. What I really like is that you CAN block individual elements of a whitelisted site. 

I actually don't like to take away someone's bread and butter by blocking the ads. So I was looking for a filter to protect me from spyware and malware which they all do but I also wanted a way to block individual horrendously annoying elements easily which this does pretty well. The others don't let you do anything on a whitelisted site. This one does. This is important to me because I actually whitelist most sites.

Actually, I just tried it on a site, just on a large ad in the top right block. When you ad the filter it disappears, but each refresh brings another one back. 

I will still stick with this though. Out of 7 I tried, only one comes close to this. 

Maybe I really don't even need this though because I do not go to any "questionable" sites. It is comforting for first time visits.

Thank you for this fine piece of software.
-------------------------

This is probably the most flexible adblocking software I've ever used. Not only does it easily bypass adblock killers and allow you to pick elements to block, but it also has an extensive, fully customizable filter list. Overall, it's my personal favorite.
-------------------------
filter
Does exactly what it says on the tin and does it well. Blocks ads/tracking elements reliably without interrupting other site content, integrates with the standard adblock filter formats used in other adblock extensions, provides an easy interface to custom-pick elements to create custom blocking rules without even needing to know the adblock script syntax. A must-have piece of the puzzle for convenience, privacy, and security concerns.

Also it was recommended by Taylor Swift on Twitter.

it does what I want it to, I also find it easy to add new content to the block lists.

Absolutely brilliant, so many lists to choose from, better than ABP.  Can't recommend highly enough. Temporary unblocking is brilliant if you're online shopping etc.

Only missing feature is that you can't see exactly what has been blocked and what is allowed but if you turn advanced mode on you get some way towards showing this.

Great adblock extension. My favorite feature is the toggling of certain filtering/blocking (i.e. cosmetic filtering, strict blocking, etc.) It makes it really helpful on sites that say turn off your adblock. Most of the time I toggle the cosmetic blocking and it doesn't even recognize the extension. Plus, it has a ton of filter lists to boot so it's my favorite and I've tried all of them.

Twitch fairly recently changed how ads work on their site, they run within the stream itself now rather than as a separate overlay. I don't know of any filters right now that block every ad on twitch, some always get through.

Disclaimer: I'm just a happy uBO user, not developer. Shortly: Yes. Details: uBO blocks all known miners by default as any known abusive element on Internet. uBO creator made a separate lists called "uBlock filters -- Resource abuse" (on by default) specifically for such cases, miners are blocked based on address as any other unwanted resources like ads or tracking, there were no changes in UI. Of course, you can always add other lists if you like to white-list mining on a particular domain. See the list on GitHub: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/blob/master/filters/resource-abuse.txt Some early discussion about miners: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/690 If you'd like to allow mining in some cases and need a graphical UI for that, I'd try disabling the "Resource abuse" filter and using No Coin extension (I never used it myself, but it is surprisingly popular (4.74 stars and 70K+ users).

Dear gorhill, I'm a long time user of your extension and I really admire and appreciate your work on uBlock. The things I like the most about uBlock over other extensions are its performance, low memory usage and extensions to the EasyList grammar which makes it really powerful especially for blocking anti-adblock contents. Currently you are including some of your rules and replacement contents namely resources.txt, filters.txt and badware.txt as static assets as part of your extension itself. Since the replacement resources in resources.txt are highly effective in dealing with anti-adblock scripts, I'm wondering if you are willing to host them as part of other crowd-sourced filters like EasyList so that the community can contribute more replacement scripts for anti-adblock detection scripts and it could potentially be used by other extensions as well. Please let me know your thoughts on this suggestion. Thanks, K'vel

Looks like all is working fine here using default settings + default filter lists.

Works fine for me using default settings. What filter lists do you have enabled? Enumerate all the settings which differ from default ones.

Tested with Version 42.0.2292.0 dev (64-bit), and it worked all fine. What are your custom filters and dynamic filtering rules (if any)?
-------------------------
filter
I installed a fresh version of uBlock, and it does not block everything by default. Check you custom filters -- and dynamic rules if you have any.
-------------------------
filter
I think less filters should be enabled by default. Actually this extension function perfectly with just the Easylist filter enabled. Most other lists are mostly redundant and increase CPU usage for nothing. Otherwise it is pretty good, I do not see the lags I saw with Adblock+. The extra feature present in Adblock+ slow it down for no real benefit.
-------------------------
filter
uBlock is optimised in such way that even with the extra filter lists it is still significantly leaner than other blockers. The benchmarks are real measurements. The largest contribution to CPU usage are the cosmetic filters, and only EasyList has such filters among the filter lists selected by default. So the extra lists, EasyPrivacy, Peter Lowe's and Malware domains have virtually no incidence on CPU usage.
-------------------------
filter
Seems to work fine. You have to tell me exactly what is broken. Also, what filter lists you have selected.
-------------------------
list
I would love a black list, in addition to the white list. It would be just the opposite of the white list. thank you!
-------------------------
filter
If you are comfortable with dynamic filtering, this works: block 1st and 3rd party scripts. Pages load *much* faster on this site, and links work. Some widgets will be broken on it though, like comments section. But if you just want to read, this works all fine.
-------------------------
filter
i've successfully used the filters function to block certain elements/images. it would be awesome if one could do this from a simple right click instead of going through the process of copying an image location and and manually adding to a filtered list. Awesome product otherwise.
-------------------------
filter
I tried with the default filter lists selected and the video plays just fine. What other lists do you have enabled? To whitelist one particular item requires to create an exception filter, so a user must have knowledge of how filters work.

Hi, I've discovered your extension thanks to Martin's post on ghacks.net; great work, I really like it. Two questions/suggestions: 1. Could you add an overview of all whitelisted (I mean: whitelisting by clicking the enable/disable button in the drop down menu) sites to the settings? What would be even better: an option to import/export those filters. 2. It would be nice to be able to globally enable/disable the filtering (without having to disable the whole extension). Sometimes I want to browse multiple sites without adblockers and it's much easier to temporarily pause filtering globally than to turn it off (and then on back again later on) for each site separately. Thanks for your effort! Simon
-------------------------
filter
It would be nice to see which elements on webpage are being currently blocked and which filter blocks them. In future releases it could really help people to make whitelists. Thank you!

Hi, great work with uBlock Extension. Although it requires few features: 1. possibility to add new filter list from custom url 2. exception filters doesn't seem to work for example: @@||yoursite.com^$document they work fine in adblock thank you in advance!

After countless years of using countless ad blockers, finally the best one bar none.
Lightweight and fast. No ads nor premium: it's free and open source. Perfect default settings. Customization for everything. Extremely powerful if one wants and knows how. Educational too given the documentation. I love it.
-------------------------

Can't recommend enough. Lots of great default filters for the less techy types, and easy to add more filter lists for more cautious folks as well.
-------------------------

uBlock Origin has been the king of adblocking on Chrome for years now, and for very good reason. It's efficient and provides sane defaults, all while allowing power users to customize everything as they see fit.

The cloud storage support is also one of the top features to note, allowing you to easily synchronize all your filters, rules and whitelists across different machines.
-------------------------
default
Awesome!!! This is a MUST-HAVE extension.

I am an advanced user and have tried virtually every major ad and tracker blocker. 

Without hesitation, this is the best one for both blocking ads and trackers.

Whether you're an advanced or casual user, it gives you the amount of control that you want to take.  If a site is having problems because of blocked content, uBlock Origin makes it easy to fix it.

And if you mess up any of the settings, going back to default or unblocked is super easy.
-------------------------
default
Based on what I've read about this, including recommendations from web anonymity and security researchers, I'm glad to have it. I switched from Adblock which worked well (not perfectly) and I'm already appreciating uBlock's features. However, I knew it was going to be perfect when I saw it was from the same developer as uMatrix, which allows blocking of elements of a website based on type (script, cookie, image‚Ä¶) and/or source domain, and also uses lists to block all elements from ad/malware domains. It by default blocks certain elements from all external domains, although all default rules are fully editable. Speed and flexibility of the visual interface to change site rules is notable. This 'matrix' also allows us to see what is going on on the webpage- how many X from domain Y being allowed/blocked. Both uBlock and uMatrix are strongly recommended though uBlock for *everyone* and uMatrix if you're a technophile and/or especially care about minimising your footprint online. uBlock is for everyone because I don't think anyone likes ads, especially these days when they are more aggressive, even on very respectable websites. The reduced memory use and marketer tracking are two other major reasons, if you're not convinced.
-------------------------
default
Since Adblock sold out, this is the best blocker I've seen (should have changed to this ages ago).

I've been using this for a while now and it's much better, blocks more efficiently annoying ads and performance is quite nice.

Extensive filter lists to choose from (defaults are fine without any addition).
Plus also same (and extended) "own filtering" as Adblock, which you can import.
-------------------------
default
By far the absolute best ad blocker on any market. AdBlockPlus failed for years and had a clunky interface compared to uBlock Origin. Get this Ad Blocker because it really works! Works so good I can't say enough good things about it. Try it and find out for yourself. By default it adds a few good repositories but you can add more and they've done the work for you to, just check the ones you need added and Apply changes. Also comes with a eye dropper to block anything on screen. That was always an extension to AdBlockPlus. uBlock Origin all the way!
-------------------------
default
This extension brilliantly serves 2 different sets of users: by default it is an 'install it and forget it', just works, and works very well. But if you really want to explore your options, switch to advanced mode, and there is really no limit on how intricate you want your configuration to be. 
 Far ahead of adblock, adblock plus and other similar projects.
-------------------------
default
Very impressed so far. I didn't have many slowdown issues with Adblock (Adblock Plus was really problematic for me, plus sellout-concerns), but the ones I had this fixed.

I'm not quite sure I am on board with the default loadout of blocks, because I also run Ghostery and I suspect the privacy-related stuff is superfluous as a result. Still, a very good extension and heartily recommended.
-------------------------
default
@Zach Fein: Thanks for the info! Re-installing uBO got me version 1.27.10 and and now the extension seems to work once again. Might also have something to do with the advanced settings or filters as I suspect those have now been reverted to their default values.
-------------------------
default
It's not a uBlock issue cause it works perfectly fine for me. Try setting uBlock back to defaults
-------------------------

It works with the default settings in gmail for me so put your changes back to the default settings and it should work. Hope this helps : ) G.P.

Disclaimer: I'm just a happy uBO user, not developer. Shortly: Yes. Details: uBO blocks all known miners by default as any known abusive element on Internet. uBO creator made a separate lists called "uBlock filters -- Resource abuse" (on by default) specifically for such cases, miners are blocked based on address as any other unwanted resources like ads or tracking, there were no changes in UI. Of course, you can always add other lists if you like to white-list mining on a particular domain. See the list on GitHub: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/blob/master/filters/resource-abuse.txt Some early discussion about miners: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/690 If you'd like to allow mining in some cases and need a graphical UI for that, I'd try disabling the "Resource abuse" filter and using No Coin extension (I never used it myself, but it is surprisingly popular (4.74 stars and 70K+ users).
-------------------------
default
any issue with specific web sites need to be reported at https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues#, along with all details of how a volunteer can reproduce the issue, so that this can be investigated and fixed. I loaded primewire.ag in Chrome and it seems to work just fine when using uBlock Origin's default settings. Be awere that web sites may changed their code and in such case volunteers need to craft new filters.
-------------------------

Hey glad u are kin to work together to create a better uBlock/ uBlock origin:D 1. I use all ad blockers at default settings to test at the best and most fair level. 2. Webpages measures are all random but most frequents are google.com, youtube.com, hotmail.com etc. 3. Windows7 Profession with no bloatwares, viruses spywares just fully clean pc. Latest windows 7 updates to the best stability. Hopefully we will see a reborn UBlock from you:D

I try outlook.com with the default settings, and it works all fine as far as I can tell. What settings did you change from default settings?

I know that you have given us the per-site popup blocker button but would it be possible for you to give us an option to enable the popup blocker for all websites by default? I would rather selectively enable popups than to disable them for each sites. Your extension is truly the one and only. It gives us the total control of scripts unlike anything on the Chrome store.

I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.

Maybe I was doing something wrong but this ad blocker slowed my Chrome and Edge down to a crawl on sites like Facebook. It took me a while to figure out what was wrong until I started using Brave browser. Brave removes and replaces ads with their own so Brave works flawlessly regardless of uBlock. It got me started to think that maybe it was ads that was causing Chrome & Edge to be so sluggish. I disabled uBlock and everything is running nice and smooth now on both browsers. Maybe I had something in my settings wrong in uBlock, I don't know but it did not like my Chromium browsers. It works really well in Firefox though so I guess I'll keep it there.

AdBlock is a grandchild of uBlock Origin. uBlock Origin is the original program that Adblock was built off of since it was a free open source code at first. But take heed, take notice that Adblock is often confused with AdGuard. 

AdGuard is a program, not an extension of your browser, and it monitors and profits from sitting in the background as a separate program and eyeballs ALL the sites you visit, keeping a record and roster of each one, then sells that information to ad marketing groups. 

That is why, if you notice, uBlock Origin and AdBlock sit on the side as merely an extension of your browser (posting an icon in the upper right hand corner of your browser window) and does not hijack a list of monitored internet sites you visit like AdGuard does. AdGaurd tries to fraudulently deceive you around the point by claiming they protect off line content too within various apps, but all that means in real life is that they do that to get a list of your total computer activity, not just your internet browsing activity. AdGaurd is not a malicious program, but do not be deceived, IT IS AN INVASIVE PROGRAM!

Also, if you get use to using uBlock Origin you will see that they have settings in their control icon where you can block a pages' media data and what-not else, but you can also turn that off and be free to use media players and such on specific sites. You just have to tell it what to do. uBlock is by far the best out there right now IMHO if you include privacy, trust, and genuineness in their agreement with users.

I usually don't take the time to write reviews for browser extensions these days, but for gorhill's extensions, as an IT Security guy, I'm making an exception, because he has been a rock solid, consistently trustworthy and capable extension developer for several years now, and I would probably just flat out quit using the web if I didn't have tools like his uBlock Origin and uMatrix extensions on my browser's side to let me keep the garbage littering the internet today out of my machine. I do not browse without these extensions, and it's likely that I never will again. These tools are that necessary in today's world because the bad guys and the "not bad" bad guys have so ruined the internet today.

Not on my computer.  Which browser do you use?  I know it doesn't work well with UC Browser for PC because they have their own built in ad blocker.  But it works perfectly in Chrome, Firefox and Opera.  It blocks every ad in my browsers. It's 110x's better than ABP which was once my favorite.
-------------------------

I won't visit a website without this running. Essential part of the browser these days.

This is the best browser extension of all time.  

There is no reason to worry about granting full permission for uBlock to monitor everything.  It's an open source project, everyone can examine the code and see for themselves what's going on.
-------------------------

Works great!  A lot easier on resources that AdBlock and AdBlock Plus, and I noticed a reduction in the clutter in my browser.  A lot of stuff that ABP was letting through isn't there any more.  Highly recommended!

The best adblock I've every used. 30MB of RAM vs over 100MB for ABP and doesn't slow down the browser like other extensions.

New icon looks quite ugly though.

Excellent work, gorhill. Immensely appreciated :)

Edit: I'm not worried about the new permissions because this is an opensource extension so you have access to the code to see exactly how the permission is used.

The author (Raymond Hill/gorhill) is very fast on fixing issues and refining code.

I noticed that uBlock allows the ads on some websites. The same version of uBlock is installed on Firefox, and it works perfect.

Yes. But I will keep maintaining my own version here. Roughly I consider uBlock feature-complete, and my goal is to keep it working just fine, ensuring it keeps working flawlessly on Chromium-based browser. Both versions will likely diverge eventually.

THE BEST! NO DOUBT! HANDS UP! AND HANDS DOWN! And I assure you this is not a "paid for" or robo- generated comment about a fake or phishing "ad-blocker". This one is the REAL DEAL worth any donation, because it continues to be thoughtful enough to be free and not like other softwares, forcing you into a monthly fee while selling you data and probably more taxing to your cpu. that anywhere near this fine extension!

It works perfectly! It's heavily customizable and very versatile as not just an adblocker, but also a tool to hide various annoying prompts, like cookie prompts and newsletter signups. It even blocks pop-ups saying to disable adblockers. It also can be used to save data by blocking large things like autoplaying videos and 4K images, helping sites load faster and lowering the internet bills.

AdBlock is a grandchild of uBlock Origin. uBlock Origin is the original program that Adblock was built off of since it was a free open source code at first. But take heed, take notice that Adblock is often confused with AdGuard. 

AdGuard is a program, not an extension of your browser, and it monitors and profits from sitting in the background as a separate program and eyeballs ALL the sites you visit, keeping a record and roster of each one, then sells that information to ad marketing groups. 

That is why, if you notice, uBlock Origin and AdBlock sit on the side as merely an extension of your browser (posting an icon in the upper right hand corner of your browser window) and does not hijack a list of monitored internet sites you visit like AdGuard does. AdGaurd tries to fraudulently deceive you around the point by claiming they protect off line content too within various apps, but all that means in real life is that they do that to get a list of your total computer activity, not just your internet browsing activity. AdGaurd is not a malicious program, but do not be deceived, IT IS AN INVASIVE PROGRAM!

Also, if you get use to using uBlock Origin you will see that they have settings in their control icon where you can block a pages' media data and what-not else, but you can also turn that off and be free to use media players and such on specific sites. You just have to tell it what to do. uBlock is by far the best out there right now IMHO if you include privacy, trust, and genuineness in their agreement with users.

this extension is a good adblocker, <strikethrough> but there isn't an option to disable it on all sites, which is annoying if it is forced to be on your computer because it does slow down page loading. </strikethrough> edit: this comment was made before an update. It's good now.

Maybe I was doing something wrong but this ad blocker slowed my Chrome and Edge down to a crawl on sites like Facebook. It took me a while to figure out what was wrong until I started using Brave browser. Brave removes and replaces ads with their own so Brave works flawlessly regardless of uBlock. It got me started to think that maybe it was ads that was causing Chrome & Edge to be so sluggish. I disabled uBlock and everything is running nice and smooth now on both browsers. Maybe I had something in my settings wrong in uBlock, I don't know but it did not like my Chromium browsers. It works really well in Firefox though so I guess I'll keep it there.

Ublock Origin.  Tried most (all?) other adblock solutions, it seems.  This is the only one that works ok on "Distrowatch".
Was very discouraged from using it at first.  I don't care about CPU nor memory usage.  If this was its main claim to fame, it was not for me.  But it seems to really work, EFFECTIVELY!  So it is very highly recommended now.

Ublock Origin works flawlessly for the most part. Low CPU usage and perfect ad blocking, however as of the time of this review Twitch.tv stream  have been loading extremely slowly and buffering often whilst the blocker was on. Running the same streams without Ublock and then with Adblock, the streams worked flawlessly. Hopefully this issue is looked into soon, otherwise I cannot fully recommend it to people who enjoy watching Twitch

I would never be able to use the internet without it. Having uBlock Origin, it's nearly impossible to read a news story without being annoyed by blinking advertisements all over the screen, loud sound blaring from autoplay-videos, and potentially dangerous websites disguised as familiar ones. It's a must-have for students, avid readers, those who are negatively affected by flashing lights, and people who want the web to be a less-frustrating place. I reccomend it to everyone, and have never had a problem with it. It's free, so why not try it?

Excellent ad blocker that seamlessly functions while I use the browser. Doesn't slow it down so far and truly blocks everything!

Reliable, Fast and and thorough! uBlock Origin is seriously one of the best add-ons you can get for a browser and should be running on everyone's internet browser. It doesn't get in your way and block the websites you want to access [unless they're actually malicious] like other AdBlocker services do.
-------------------------

This from my experience is the greatest ad block extension available, you can filter for what you want manually, or add in bulk by copying filter lists, allowing for great versatility over other ad block software I've tried, it's also a relatively light extension as far as high end ad block extensions come, so that's another big plus, I can't fault Ublock-Origin at all, it's a must.

This is still by far the best straight ad-blocker

‚Ä¢ It uses significantly less CPU and memory resources than ABP, AB or Adblock Edge (check the ¬µBlock github wiki page for benchmarks). The codebase is brand new, and openly developed on Github.

‚Ä¢ It blocks as well or better than these do.

‚Ä¢ It doesn't track you like AB does.

The developer is very friendly and active (as well as being open about his intentions), also check out his more detailed blocking extension, HTTPSwitchboard. An amazing extension!

Based on what I've read about this, including recommendations from web anonymity and security researchers, I'm glad to have it. I switched from Adblock which worked well (not perfectly) and I'm already appreciating uBlock's features. However, I knew it was going to be perfect when I saw it was from the same developer as uMatrix, which allows blocking of elements of a website based on type (script, cookie, image‚Ä¶) and/or source domain, and also uses lists to block all elements from ad/malware domains. It by default blocks certain elements from all external domains, although all default rules are fully editable. Speed and flexibility of the visual interface to change site rules is notable. This 'matrix' also allows us to see what is going on on the webpage- how many X from domain Y being allowed/blocked. Both uBlock and uMatrix are strongly recommended though uBlock for *everyone* and uMatrix if you're a technophile and/or especially care about minimising your footprint online. uBlock is for everyone because I don't think anyone likes ads, especially these days when they are more aggressive, even on very respectable websites. The reduced memory use and marketer tracking are two other major reasons, if you're not convinced.

If you don't like rough (ugly) interfaces, this adblocker is not for you. However, it's actually so fast that it speeds up your browsing experience and it does an amazing job. Bonus: it's not maintained by a company with conflicting interests, as many other (good) ad-blockers actually are.
-------------------------

Dropped Adblock and Adblock plus. No matter what those extensions did not filter harmful clickbait and hidden ads on certain sites. This does the trick. Even if the downloaded list of filters doesn't catch everything, it's built in element picker (which lets you get rid of elements on a webpage) catches everything and anything. 
Honestly, adblocker and its plus cousin had faulty element pickers which is why I dropped them. This is light weight, effective and more efficient. Thank you!

Ad Blocker is clunky, the amount of times I've had slow loading of pages with "waiting for ad blocker" at the bottom and then I noticed it wasn't dealing with pop ups and letting YouTube ads through so I wondered what the point of it was.  Someone mentioned this on a friend's facebook thread so I went for it and I've never looked back.  It's pretty cool, no need to know lots of scripting and you can block certain parts of a page as well.  It's also great with shutting down those annoying new tab ads that certain sites have started doing now.

Cannot say enough good things about this app. Works on every website that I use, doesn't make my computer run slow, and just overall is fantastic. I'm never going back. Now I just hope people don't think there are a bunch of bots reviewing this. I'm telling you, don't judge before you try it.

When I finally ditched Adblock, replacing it with uBlock Origin and uBlock Origin WebSocket, my 64-bit Chrome installation revved up from wallowing to absolutely screaming, the way Google intended Chrome to be.  

What I found particularly refreshing is that I can now have nearly unlimited tabs open without slowing down my computer at all.  I strongly suspect the "memory problem" some people say Chrome has isn't due to Chrome itself but a pile of interactive ads that used to load in each and every tab.

With the uBlock Origin pair of extensions, my browsing experience has been restored to "Absolutely Stellar."

10/10, light weight and fast. This extension is a must have!

cpu
Amazing, thanks for liberating my CPU (and Chrome) from the cpu and memory hogs.
-------------------------
cpu
With a Chromebook, CPU is vital. With uBlock, you have more CPU and the same functionality as other tools. Can't beat it.

fast!

This is fast and works! Better than Adblock Plus for me.
-------------------------
cpu
Really great. People will scoff at the idea of a low-memory, low-cpu, ad blocker. As a chrome extension this is exactly what you want. I run a lot of extensions so saving memory and cpu at any point is awesome.
-------------------------
speed
Really good! Seems to have increased my browsing speeds compared to AdBlock Plus. Also blocks all Ads which is awesome as well.
-------------------------
fast
I am impressed at how good and fast it works, but would like to see whitelisting. Once I get that, I am gonna rate it five stars.

Edit: Whitelist landed, I am happy.
-------------------------
fast
Fast and lean. What's not to love? It works so well!  No ads anymore, browsing is faster, easy to disable if necessary. Simply excellent.
-------------------------
cpu
this is a weird issue. it only started happening last night. When I open Chrome and navigate to any webpage it'll lock out - just stay on an eternal loading screen. Once it locks out, it'll also lock out trying to load a page that doesn't require the internet, like Chrome's settings. Checking Windows Task Manager shows one of the Chrome processes exploding with CPU usage. Force closing it disables uBlock, and webpages then load like normal. Reloading uBlock manually keeps everything functioning as normal, until I close and reopen Chrome again - the process repeats. idk what's changed. My uBlock is up to date, as is my Chrome.
-------------------------
fast
first of all, I am very much appreciate the effort done by the all developing team its really very nice and fast plugin. but some website detects the plugin and doesn't allow to continue without disabling your plugin. so please develop a plugin in a such a way that websites are never ever able to detect that please see one example website https://www.chipverify.com/
-------------------------
slow
I think less filters should be enabled by default. Actually this extension function perfectly with just the Easylist filter enabled. Most other lists are mostly redundant and increase CPU usage for nothing. Otherwise it is pretty good, I do not see the lags I saw with Adblock+. The extra feature present in Adblock+ slow it down for no real benefit.
-------------------------
cpu
uBlock is optimised in such way that even with the extra filter lists it is still significantly leaner than other blockers. The benchmarks are real measurements. The largest contribution to CPU usage are the cosmetic filters, and only EasyList has such filters among the filter lists selected by default. So the extra lists, EasyPrivacy, Peter Lowe's and Malware domains have virtually no incidence on CPU usage.

Blocks image ads perfectly. Video ads are a little iffy but I can't blame it because different platforms use different techniques, still works on YouTube which is good. 

I think the visual of the number of trackers is annoying to some users but it shows the insane amount of trackers websites use, maybe it could be compressed though to just say the number of trackers and allow the user to expand it.

Does not block facebook ads at all.
-------------------------
block
One of the best AD/Tracker block type extensions for chrome.

Appreciate the work.
-------------------------
block
The reason why I wanna give it 5 stars is because it blocks YouTube ads as-well, while most of the YouTube ad blockers don't actually work. This app still doesn't really block all the website ads and would love to see that in the next update but honestly overall good work team. kudos. :)
-------------------------
block
THIS EXTENSION IS GREAT FOR ME 
IMMA STUDENT AND I NEED TTO STUDY ON YOUTUBE. THERE ARE JUST SO MANY ADS IN YT SO I USED THIS EXTENSION TO BLOCK THEM OFF! THIS A BLOCKER IS MUST!


WELL DONE
-------------------------
block
locks adds that's true but doesn't block trackers, especially FB trackers
-------------------------
block
I like the interface and how you can see how many trackers are spotted.
Try for fun pausing ghostery on some sites and you will see how the number of trackers increases because in blocking mode Ghostery sees how many trackers the site itself uses. But whe those trackers are allowed to do their thing they all sneakily invite their friends and you end up with a higher tracker-count. And now we know why some sites are so slow.
I love Ghostery for this. It protects me and also tells me what is going on.
-------------------------

Great! Blocks ads on Youtube- works well. 10/10. If you're looking for an adblocker this is the one for you!
-------------------------

Not blocking youtube ads as it used to do.

An absolutely GREAT extension that is easily the smartest privacy app offered by Chrome and Firefox. Blocks the trackers that mean us harm, keeps the trackers that helps sites function properly. Tremendous.

prevent
The best way to prevent your private data from leaking out of Chrome and into Ads.  This really works and I'm grateful that I found it.
-------------------------
block
Almost perfect, simple, powerful, lightweight, but it doesn't have a contextual menu to block ads manually (User filters).
-------------------------
block
Very useful and cookie/ads selective app that can be tailored to your needs. It has a comprehensive and itemised list of tracking cookies/ads that can be 100% blocked on all sites, or on the site of your choice or white-listed altogether. Remember that all other ad block apps do it in a blanket manner either blocking everything or upon disabling it, they allow all third party ads & cookies to pop up. Ghostery is a gem of an extension/app. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
Loved it till
 But today I have checked that it Doesn't Block YouTube Video ads. :(

Edit: Fixed! Now it works like a charm. Can you add "Block Element" option in ghostery, it will be really helpful for all of your users like ME!
-------------------------
block
not sure if this helps you but i found "adblock for youtube" works great for me it blocks ad, annotations and now bestprice what ever that is lol. and it has not failed me yet i hope it helps you too
-------------------------
block
I have tried and tested the vast majority of ad blockers, redirect removers and pop-up/pop under blockers available here in the Chrome Web Store.

This one of very few competent extensions which can reliably block redirects and pop-ups/popunders on Adult Content sites.

You occasionaly need to Trust a website because Ghostery can be overly aggresive with its blocking, for this reason I can not give Gjostery a full 5 Star Rating.
-------------------------
protect
Loved Ghostery, until I installed a pi-hole and found Ghostery calling home 391 times in 24 hrs. I trusted Ghostery to protect me, not sell me out. GONE! SEE YA!!

It's a nice tool to see what's going on behind your back, because, you are, to the companies that "spy" on you, more or less anonymous. Many people who installed this are hoping to be ads-free on the net, but to them i can recommend this extension IN ADDITION to some great ad-blockers, that are script-blockers. A few good of those is AdBlock, AdBlock Plus (b√©ta), FlashBlock, etc. Pick a good one that has options that you can set webpages as you want on that domain, they even block ALL ADS like on YouTube, or other video sites that got those annoying loud ads. They are the past with them. For your privacy traces, is suggest another very great extension, and that's Click&Clean, it has tons of possibilities, to see everything in Chrome, or your computer. You get 1 button, click on it, and you can manage everything about Chrome, record things, take snapshots, etc, etc. But the best thing is it's main reason for you, and that's CLEANING your surf TRACES, CLEANING ALL or ONLY THE RANDOME COOCKIES, KEEP ALL IMPORTANT YOUR PASSWORDS, FORM DATA, and erase things you want. It also has a great option, where you can click on what, how, when to clean-up. Even when you close Chrome, it then asks remove history, etc.? All with a memory. BUT KEEP GHOSTERY, because who's SPYING ON YOU, those scripts aren't blocked that easy. Because you DON'T SEE THEM, so it doesn't annoy you, but they are there. And GHOSTERY will pinpoint them out for you! Read GHOST. FAQ, and you'll find it all out very easy! Thank you, GHOSTERY, to keep guard for us, and telling us who's peering, spying on us all!!! Succes!!


I have to reload every page suddenly to activate Ghostery. It blocked adds on sites like YT, but now i have to activate Ghost on every page. It was such a good app. Why change it when everything works perfect...
-------------------------
block
Works great! I would recommend this extension to everyone.
Ghostery block all the malvertising and trackers those usually blocked by my anti-malware(Malwarebytes). but now Ghostery blocked all of them first that it does not notify my anymore. What a nice extension to put my mind at ease when browsing sites. Good job!
-------------------------
block
sexy. blocks most ads. Some still get through and are not blockable (as in I will block them, but they will show up again after i refresh the page)
-------------------------
block
its blocks every single ad in chrome amazingly done love this <3

Wether you find this review helpful or not. Ghostery is absolutely brilliant. Like many humans actually typing a key board ( not asking Echo or cortana ect) to review many a page in shopping, reading ect ect to block such annoying irratating pop ups can we help choose your sofa  ? ( No you Bloody cannot) Is frankly awsome thank goodness for Gostery oh & the inventor :)

I have had this since I have had this computer and with all the school work I have been doing it really helps. I have had all the ads blocked and not in my way.
-------------------------
block
Very good blocks almost all ads.
-------------------------
block
I have used several "blocking" software/extensions/apps and this is by far the best - well done guy's, fantastic. I am probably doing something wrong,  but I don't seem to be able to whitelist domains like Channel4 that detects it and will not play catch-up/on demand TV unless I manual pause it, but love the option you can select how long to pause as I don't have to remember to resume Ghostery when done on that domain.
-------------------------
block
I love this! If you use a regular ad blocker, some websites make you whitelist them, but Ghostery completely avoids this!!! It also gives the user full control of what things will be blocked and what pages will block trackers. It is amazing.
-------------------------
protect
I love Ghostery....for years now. Does a great job of protecting my privacy. Thank you Ghostery!
-------------------------

This is a great extension.  I love to open Ghostery and scroll through to see all the trackers is has blocked on different websites! It's kind of fun, actually.
-------------------------
block
Works extremely well in Chrome. It is also highly customizable and can be turned on and off to view certain types of pages that might not load properly when ads and other nuisances are being blocked. I've used Ghostery for years and have utmost confidence in it.
-------------------------
block
Blocks more than any other Ad blocking extension I have tried.  Also really like how it shows exactly what is actually being blocked.  Very nice job Ghostery team!!!  I also use their browser on my tablet and it is very snappy!!
-------------------------

Useful extension, not just to block stuff tracking us but to be aware of it. But most importantly for me to see what competitors are using as their  analytics stack :)

It works fine,You have to tinker around with what ads to block and what not to block. If you just block everything sites will act sluggish or not load at all. So take your time to figure out what ads to block or save in order for things to work right for you.
-------------------------
block
I love it. Blocks most things and it is easy to trust a site.
-------------------------
block
I don't surf without this add-on, no matter what browser I'm using. It keeps the creeps away!

There are times it blocks elements that I need to use (video players on school sites) but overall this is worthwhile. 

If you use a VPN service that has blocking already implemented, you probably DON'T need this.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block everything it claims too.  Try using something else
-------------------------
block
Made my browsing speed super fast with its advanced blocking features.
-------------------------

Great Extension, because you can set up what you want or don't want to block, you never run into the issue that Ad-Blocker has where videos and audio won't load. The app is beautiful, simplistic, and easy to use. Well done.
-------------------------
block
it blocks trackers and also provide you the option to not block a site(trust a site), which is amazing.
-------------------------
protect
The best for security and protection in the web!

This is great! I still use a cookie blocker (Vanilla) but other than that, this extension is great!

There is also a very noticeable speed difference. I also really appreciate the information that it provides about the cites that it is blocking.

I think everyone should have this! Good work.
-------------------------
block
You want privacy? Then this is the extension you need when it comes to blocking ALL trackers. I have tried other block tracking extensions and security/privacy apps and 
Ghostery is the most comprehensive app available.
-------------------------
prevent
I've been using Ghostery ever since I heard about it a while back, Countless and unimaginable amounts of data and time have been saved because of Ghostery. Successfully allowing the marketers I am wanting to ALLOW vs them not having permission and still placing themselves thru a backdoor cookie, the intrusion and data pulled across so many layers of digital unknowns. (It's disturbing to find out the $ value for just one person on one website;if being specific one of the big players says you are worth exactly $13.00. So, I am happy that this exists. Perhaps a pizzagate preventing script could be  on the horizon expanding Ghostery's capabilitys. Id love to have it prevent me from reading fake news stories. False information = 0 ... This is art in its highest form. Smart technology that is worth the investment to use. Couldn't say enough kudos to the men and women who work and continue to work on this. Thanks folks. Keep up the good work.

prevent
This is an absolute necessary tool to help prevent unwanted programs, bots, searches, etc. in and on your PC.
Everyone needs to use & support these developers and staff.

GREAT.

I Love Ghostery. My Only request is that I would like to see Ghostery play just a little bit better with other Ad blocking extensions. Ghostery, & my other extensions they sometimes cancel each other out. When that happens I get a extension error alert/message. (((It's Not a big issue with me, but still))). On the Plus Side I think both Ghostery, & the one other ad blocker extension (((that will remain nameless))) both together stopped those annoying YouTube, & Ustream ads/Commericals COMPLETELY. I haven't seen a single ad/commercial in about a year now. That in itself is AWESOME! 5 stars. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. :)
-------------------------

Excellent tool. I love seeing the little purple box in the corner showing me all the rubbish it's blocking

I used to love it but now they've jumped in bed with advertisers and won't block ads from big companies only small ones.

I was elated about the change back to the darker purple box but now I'm having issues with ads and trackers that used to be blocked not being blocked anymore and I haven't changed anything other making sure something that wasn't blocked before is now blocked.
I still prefer the old interface but my eyes appreciate the darker purple box. Thanks for changing it back.
-------------------------

it blocks things that i never knew existed. easy to unblock specific items and leave other stuff i dont want to let through. Love this extension, used it for years without issues.

detect
This is great! Websites can't detect if you are using this as an ad blocker. My only problem is that the screen goes blank on my chromebook but it's fine on my windows
-------------------------

Ghostery's latest update adds a cleaner interface with more details and information. Blocking trackers, advertising, analytics, and actually explaining which ones they are. Running this along with ad-blocking you can create a fast, clean, safe internet experience! Great job guys.
-------------------------
block
I use it on MacBook, Windows, and the iPhone version. ALL ARE GREAT!!

Just have to enable tracker blocking. It defaults to NO blocking, in case some users are not aware of this.
-------------------------
block
Love the recent update-categorizing trackers by classification--makes it easier for me to know which tracker should I block or not.
-------------------------
block
I've been using Ghostery for a long time and IMHO, this is the best version of the extension yet.

The new bigger panel makes it easier to see at a glance what trackers are present on the current website and it's also easier to check/uncheck blocking options.

The developers have also added the ability to see which blocked tracker is causing a web page not to function correctly.

That is a huge improvement over previous versions because it could take quite a long time to check/uncheck/reload the page to see which trackers, of which there are many on some websites, need to be unblocked for the web page to display correctly.

I wouldn't go anywhere on the web without this extension being loaded and active in my brower.
-------------------------

Ghostery provides the trust, credibility and control required to manage my online privacy. It's not about blocking everything, it's about controlling access. Thank you.

Awesome. use it whenever I need it I hate add pop ups and this is a great app for it. just like a auto cleaner but for the web lets u see all those trackers and u'll be surprised at how many it can block the biggest amount I have had is 16 anyone can beat the
-------------------------
block
awesome....can block anything
-------------------------
block
Amazing.  
I saw this extension reviews and had to get it.
I was shocked to see how many sites are tracking my every move, even after choosing "opt out" with Google.

I would like to see an "auto add" feature, so that I didn't have to manually flip the switch every time the program finds a new tracker.

And also, if you already have a tracker blocked, I would like that tracker to NOW show in the list of trackers blocked (it's a pop up window).

I still give it 5 stars because I can now have control who does and doesn't see me!

Just get this...seriously that good!
-------------------------
block
holy furballs... i can block ads WITHOUT being known i'm blocking ads! for instance, a resource website for gaming, they slow down people with ad blockers, i go there and BAM! no ads, no warning about adblocker, I will finally be able to save some data! great job, ghostery!
something that i'd love to see is an option to narrow down ads. We don't wanna starve off websites, do we? but if you could block ads that are deemed "obnoxious" and keep the non-obnoxious ads, it'd be great! i absolutely love this! works like a assasin rather than a viking!
-------------------------

it does make a difference initially but now it doesn't block the pop up ads and adult ads.. plz do something other than that i love it....

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  I run a cleaner program several times a day because I detest - and resent - all the crap that ends up on my devices.  Ghostery blocks an awful lot of garbage before it ships off my vital info to ....wherever it goes.

There are some very nasty people out there who you don't particularly wish to find when you are searching. Ghostery allows you to give them the boot.

Blue Chan is right about the advantages of site specific rather than global. I suppose it's something to accept when its free protection of your privacy.

It's excellent and it really does what it says. However sometimes it is unable to block graphical ads on manga/video streaming sites without you manually intervening. But rest 99% bam! Spot On! Also one should be careful to specify a certain ad which needs to track you, example pizza delivery and stuff. Other than that, it's pretty slick!

You will be AMAZED at how much insidious tracking is being done on your browser activity by 100's and 100's of trackers, beacons, and stuff I didn't even know existed.

This is one of the absolute best apps for any browser, and my advice: don't even think about getting on the web without it.

I should have installed this ages ago! Ghostery gives users total control over which trackers to block, lets you individualize rules per domain or per tracker and it shows all the trackers available.

The app is very transparent, the UI is intuitive and the tutorial explains all the features. I'm keeping this.
-------------------------
block
I feel much safer on the web now.

This privacy (and ads if you want) blocker is a very smart tweak to the general third-party blocking concept. And this one is very well implemented too! Lots of easy-to-use options to customize it to work just the way you want.

Honestly, one of the best extensions I've seen in awhile. A lot of extensions are useful but cludgy or missing that little extra polish. This one has it all.

Kudos!

I have used Ghostery for about 6 months now and love it. Ghostery gives you so much control over what you do or don't want to see. Site loading and flash players both go quickly and smoothly now. I initially started using Ghostery because I was tired of the ongoing competition between ads and my flash player over loading time. I was getting choppy flash player display whenever a new ad would load. You can choose exactly what you want to block and Ghostery regularly updates the bug list. You can see exactly what scripts are being blocked on each site (if you want) and what type of information they are meant to collect. The biggest plus for me about Ghostery is that you don't even notice it's there except for the lack of flashing banners and obnoxious auto-audio in video ads. It is the silent guardian of your internet browser. You have the option to get more notifications about activity if you want, but for people like me that just want a bit of peace from the advertisements, it does all of the work without bragging about it. After using it on my home computer for a couple of weeks, I went ahead and added Ghostery to my work computer as well, with equally satisfactory results. I highly recommend this program.
-------------------------

Done the job it was meant to do really well. Be careful with it as it can sometimes reduce certain websites functionality if you block certain things. Does the job it was meant to.

An outstanding tool that seamlessly blocks more crap (technical term) than you can imagine.  Blocks beacons, advertisements, flash, and many other technologies that are taken advantage by malware creators.
-------------------------

You must first set it up to block all through the * button - not obvious but it works. Then you can review each blocked tracker and decide if you actually want it blocked. Some video content will not run unless you allow the track - same with ads. I have other ad-blockers installed in Chrome which are now dormant as Ghostery reacts faster than they do. Get it! Ghostery is well worth the learning curve.

Very Handy app to weed out all the bloatware cookies that can slow down a site loading whilst your browsing it can also with one click allow the background software and adware cookies that is helpful to remain and not keep asking you if you wanna block them so i like it its surprising how many programs use background software that is no good to you or you just dont need them anymore!

The best- awesome how it tells you who's tracking you and what type they are. Works beautifully! How wonderful to know that the trackers are now unable to track you anymore-thanks to Ghostery!

A little problem- sometimes there are little extension errors if you already have AVAST  online protection. Sometimes Ghostery overpowers it a little. Your settings icon will flash orange, but that's it. If you ignore it, nothing will happen! That's all, nothing much.

It is very much recommended!

Best thing that could have happened to my browser. It always makes me smile when I see hundreds of different trackers being blocked on the sites I visit.
-------------------------

Not only does it seem to comprehensively block the most annoying parts of the web, it also provides valuable insight and education into exactly what these trackers do, thereby giving the user actionable intelligence to make the decision whether or not to opt-in to the third-party service. This extension gives control back to the user, plain and simple.
One of the most useful chrome extension. You'll be shocked at how many sites and ad services are tracking you!
-------------------------

Very easy to use and block trackers, ads and privacy related elements. Definitely something to recommend to anyone!

Ghostery is fabulous. It has protected my browser  for years and has NEVER given me any problems.  The interface is clean and easy to use. Thanks for such a practical app!
-------------------------

Great extension. Easy to see what's being blocked, and whitelist sites for local development. Pageloads are appreciably better.
-------------------------
block
Brilliant and works. According to FAQ it makes pages load faster when blocking enough.
-------------------------
block
While no anti-tracking tool is perfect, you can at least make it more difficult for the would-be trackers to profile your browsing behavior. 

The interface is clean, polished, and intuitive. You can always temporarily pause blocking if you find a certain site's functionality is reduced. You can also whitelist sites you trust. Since new trackers are always being created, the app auto-updates the blacklist periodically (though you can disable this if you want). It also seems to work well with other plugins.

I find Ghostery, Adblock Plus, and ScriptSafe (along with some common sense) are the most essential plugins for safe browsing and eliminate 95% of the most annoying parts of browsing the web.
-------------------------

Ghostery made my life a lot easier. It can block unwanted tracking scripts, provide insights i.e., it provides me control.
Thanks

amazing how much it blocks
-------------------------
block
this is good for ads blocking
-------------------------
block
This extension is amazing. I use it as an adblocker even sites such as pandora that tell you to upgrade to remove ads doesn't have ads. It can be as basic or as complex as you want. I recommend taking the time to adjust the settings when you first get it. 

WORD OF CAUTION!!! 
DO NOT GO IN AND BLOCK EVERYTHING. SOME SITES REQUIRE TRACKERS TO RUN PROPERLY. YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF LOGGING IN CONSTANTLY OR NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE SITE AT ALL. YOU WILL BE SEEING THE NUMBERS 404 VERY OFTEN. 

Just basicly know what you are doing when you block stuff and you should be fine.
-------------------------
block
good app. it notifies me of all the trackers being use, and gave me the control which ones to blocked or give permission to proceed. highly recommended.
-------------------------
protect
A very good app. You are informed about who is tracking you. It also keeps your image and comments from being used by advertisers to promote their products. This is another step towards protecting your  privacy.
-------------------------
block
Excellent plugin. Good to block unwanted ads. I loved it.
-------------------------
block
I love it! I feel so much safer when surfing the web, because Ghostery automatically blocks tracker and whatnot!
-------------------------
block
This is wonderful. It would help me if  you were to write some background on your views of the different sorts of trackers -- are there any that I might want to keep on, that do me or the world some good and don't invade my privacy? I don't have a deep understanding of them and have just turned them all off (with the understanding that I can click-to-play where it blocks content I might want to see). But some better analysis of what the different kinds of trackers are about would be helpful.  Anyhow, a great product, thank you.
-------------------------
block
This is one of the best blocking plugins out there, especially since it gives SO much control to the user and it's done in such a simple way.
-------------------------
block
An awesome app. 

Sometimes, if I block some trackers, I can't login to some services or the click on some buttons does not work, but I can temporarily pause blocking to get things done.
-------------------------
block
Fantastic. Blocks everything I wanted it to. Easy to allow trackers you want for whatever reason. (Facebook Connect in my case)
-------------------------
block
It blocks more trackers than albine solution or disconnect. The setup is easy and it works as expected. Overall, I'm very pleased. Thanks to the developer.
-------------------------
block
Fantastic, easy to temporarily pause tracking.  Easy to "allow" comment sections one time on sites.  Blocks everything I want it to block.
-------------------------
block
I've been getting sick of ad-blockers in recent months.  One sold out to a company that was letting (paying) advertisers circumvent the block, another broke browser functionality (such as the back button) and another always did a terrible job of getting rid of the frames containing the ads.

What annoys me most though is the lack of transparency.  While Ghostery isn't perfect (it also occasionally fails to remove blocked ad frames which take up precious screen real-estate), it is completely transparent and allows you to keep ads from those organisations not considered problematic.

Advertising is GOOD for the internet because many sites wouldn't be able to exist without it, but it is BAD when used for more nefarious purposes.  Being given a selective choice is liberating and that is ultimately when I like Ghostery so much.

Ghostery's professionally designed, intuitive UI and low memory footprint are merely added bonuses.
-------------------------
block
The newest update is great! I can finally see what ghostery is blocking on the page and dont have to guess as to what to allow in order to use the comments or social buttons. Very nice
-------------------------
block
love it, it blocks so many unwanted
-------------------------
block
This is a fantastic extension.  Install it now.  Your mind will be boggled at how much tracking of your actions that websites are doing.  I feel empowered, and honestly, kind of subversive ever time I block a tracker.  The only good tracker is a dead tracker.
-------------------------
block
Never thought there would be an extension like this out there. Ghostery performs a very welcomed service. It's nice to finally know who collects my information, whatever that may be and their professional affiliations. Being able to block the ones you find disagreeable makes Ghostery that much more useful.
-------------------------
block
This is an amazing little app. It truly blocks all of the tracking software that normally loads in the background without your knowledge while surfing the internet. It is an eye opener to see just how much data is being exchanged behind the scenes. It also speeds up my Chrome browser to a degree. I will never browse the net again without this type of protection. just give it a try and I am sure you will come to the same conclusion!
-------------------------
protect
Ghostery makes the web a much more pleasant experience, and it probably protects your privacy a little, too.
-------------------------

An essential extension for blocking wads of tracking etc that many sites try to push.
-------------------------

installs and updates quickly, without user interruption.  Mostly invisible, blocks all the stuff I want blocked.  Recommended!

This is probably the best tracking app out there! It blocks hundreds and hundreds of advertising trackers, analytic trackers, beacon trackers, privacy trackers and widget trackers! Thank you Ghostery and keep up the AMAZING work!

good one.
a must have
i think blocking or masking ip and malware protection can be integrated to this
-------------------------
prevent
Ghostery has fast become an essential companion to either of the foremost AdBlock(er) extensions on Chrome.  Updates are frequent and the developer seems to have a great deal of integrity.  If I could pay a little in exchange for a request, the request would be to sync settings with my google account so white listed items, etc. only have to be entered once.  of course, the ability to prevent syncing with particular devices would be helpful as my work pc settings could effectively "break" my ability to browse, say Netflix, at home.
-------------------------

I LOVE this extension. Blocking all the crap tracking JS makes websites so much more responsive and so much quicker than normal. Thanks for this awesome and useful extension!
-------------------------
block
You have to first make some easy setting changes then this becomes an awesome tool.

1 - Under General/Trackers to block: Block everything

2- Under Advanced:
Uncheck "Show Alert Bubble"
Check "Block new elements by default"
-------------------------
protect
Have a few problems with some sites so I turn it off for the few minutes I need to & then turn it back on. Not a problem for the protection it provides. Further the information about how to get Google, etc. to stop collecting information on you is great. I've forwarded it to my friends.
-------------------------
block
Great App.  The fact that it gives control over blocking, in an easy to use interface.
-------------------------
block
Excellent. Blocks ads, blocks Facebook from tracking you across the web, blocks Olark popups, and more!
-------------------------
block
I rarely give five star reviews, but this app is fantastic. I've worked in IT for years, but even for me it is amazing to see just how much information is being scraped with every page one visits. Even if you opt not to view what dinguses are trying to grab your information, this app works just great in invisible mode, blocking the scrapes. However, if you want to look deeper into the chasm, turn on the notifications and enjoy learning who the background players are, like the special features on your Blu-ray movie. A must have.
-------------------------
block
Love it! Blocks all those adds that would otherwise distract you from what you are doing.

So far so good. Didn't know there were that many invisible trackers out there. I'm letting the app basically do it's default blocking until or if I run into any problems..This will be a 5 if all remains well.
-------------------------
block
It works as specified, however everytime it blocks something a pop-up 'sub-balloon' appears over a small portion of the page. I wish it would allow me to click it's icon for that balloon. Also, this extension seems to open it's update info page every time it does something (constant updates?) whether it blocks something, or reports something, or even when I just open my browser. I wish this thing would be less ... in view.  Irritations aside, this is a solid "host.deny" or ".allow" style software cop. Thanks for making this!

3. Shows you the lists the trackers it blocked.

Enlightened, finally. Forewarned is forearmed.

So far as I can tell, this ext has kept a keen watch on all sorts of prying eyes trying to follow, map, catalog, and analyze my webehavior. 

Not only is it very good at finding the newest snitches on the block, it's very easy to control who's allowed access, who's not, etc., in 4 distinct categories of snoopery. 

This superb app works as advertised and is a force multiplier when used in combination with one or two related extensions (Collusion Graph is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for educational purposes; however, the magnitude of the prying and spying is spectacular in a "Nazi mass gathering in N√ºrnburg in the '30s" sorta way.  It's a form of eWaterBoarding that more--many more--users need to be made aware.

Ghostery is an innovative product that provides more real-time privacy protection from the emerging invasive technologies being deployed all across the web.  It took me a while to understand what Ghostery does but once I figured it out I am now committed to using it.

My primary criticism of Ghostery is that it assumes that users know a lot more about tracking technology than many of us do.  I consider myself much more knowledgeable in such matters than the average web surfer, but some of Ghostery's terminology was new to me, making it difficult for me to make best use of the product until I took time to educate myself (mostly elsewhere).

Hopefully the publishers will take this to heart and make Ghostery more friendly to those of us new to the world of the devious tracking technologies.

That said, I congratulate the publishers for a fine product that works well and performs an important task that seems to have no competition in the usually crowded field of software development.

Even in a world that seems hell bent on tracking what everyone does, it is nice to see that someone is into the opposite.  Too bad some websites refuse to allow access unless they can drop tracking cookies.

Great work!!! Thank You!!

If you want some added protection that's not restricted to your browser you should check out www.peerblock.com I block entire countries, spyware, trojans and all kinds of things that go bump in the night but everything you use is NOT fool proof. They add them as they see them. Same thing with virus protection. If you want complete security you have turn off your computer and make sure nobody can get in that room and turn it on. P.S. don't get it from some download site. Make sure it's from peerblock dot com or you're going to get something you didn't want. @Lancepimpstrong ;)

First, my friends and I love your program. Kudos for such an inventive, practical, clean and neat way to browse without being spied upon. My suggestion is this: more often than not (read: all the time), I unblock a site to get so one segment or another of it and then FORGET TO REBLOCK or restart Ghostery blocking. Sometimes for DAYS.So, if you had a switch that once activated by the user, would re-activate Ghostery's blocking, voila!, I don't have to remember to do it and one less thing to remember is a good thing. Thanks again for a wonderful and wonderfully useful program.

I have been using this plugin with Google Chrome for over 90 days now, and I am thoroughly impressed. Some of my favorite news websites, unfortunately, seem to have the most advertisements and pop-ups creating a slow and frustrating reading experience.

Ghostery has fixed this issue. At the click of a button the annoying ads and popups where gone, and the best part is that Ghostery remembers your settings for the site so you do not need to shut the ads down on your next visit!

As an IT Support and Computer Repair technician I spend a lot of time working with software. Ghostery is one of the rare applications that really delivers! I give Ghostery a thumbs up.

Amazing extension. I only use a few extensions (and have tested over 100 throughout my time switching from Firefox to Chrome) and this made the cut. It performs exactly what it states that it will do, no more and no less; which sadly is more than you can say for a lot of extensions throughout many different browsers. The popups did get annoying but eventually I turned them off and sometimes I do mess around with it because it can become very useful. It is easy to add a website to the whitelist so you can keep their trackers running -- and again there are only a few sites out of the many I visit that I allow them to use their tracker(s) - I find this extension very useful and it would receive a 5 star rating and will as soon as or if they do change their popup feature to be more user friendly and not as annoying as it currently is when turned on.

It's a nice tool to see what's going on behind your back, because, you are, to the companies that "spy" on you, more or less anonymous. Many people who installed this are hoping to be ads-free on the net, but to them i can recommend this extension IN ADDITION to some great ad-blockers, that are script-blockers. A few good of those is AdBlock, AdBlock Plus (b√©ta), FlashBlock, etc. Pick a good one that has options that you can set webpages as you want on that domain, they even block ALL ADS like on YouTube, or other video sites that got those annoying loud ads. They are the past with them. For your privacy traces, is suggest another very great extension, and that's Click&Clean, it has tons of possibilities, to see everything in Chrome, or your computer. You get 1 button, click on it, and you can manage everything about Chrome, record things, take snapshots, etc, etc. But the best thing is it's main reason for you, and that's CLEANING your surf TRACES, CLEANING ALL or ONLY THE RANDOME COOCKIES, KEEP ALL IMPORTANT YOUR PASSWORDS, FORM DATA, and erase things you want. It also has a great option, where you can click on what, how, when to clean-up. Even when you close Chrome, it then asks remove history, etc.? All with a memory. BUT KEEP GHOSTERY, because who's SPYING ON YOU, those scripts aren't blocked that easy. Because you DON'T SEE THEM, so it doesn't annoy you, but they are there. And GHOSTERY will pinpoint them out for you! Read GHOST. FAQ, and you'll find it all out very easy! Thank you, GHOSTERY, to keep guard for us, and telling us who's peering, spying on us all!!! Succes!!


I have to reload every page suddenly to activate Ghostery. It blocked adds on sites like YT, but now i have to activate Ghost on every page. It was such a good app. Why change it when everything works perfect...

That's no problem. It takes about 20 seconds to pause it and then just turn it back on. That's so simple. Pause ghostery and reload the page and the video plays. It doesn't interfere with YouTube, just videos' on a website page. So simple

I Love Ghostery. My Only request is that I would like to see Ghostery play just a little bit better with other Ad blocking extensions. Ghostery, & my other extensions they sometimes cancel each other out. When that happens I get a extension error alert/message. (((It's Not a big issue with me, but still))). On the Plus Side I think both Ghostery, & the one other ad blocker extension (((that will remain nameless))) both together stopped those annoying YouTube, & Ustream ads/Commericals COMPLETELY. I haven't seen a single ad/commercial in about a year now. That in itself is AWESOME! 5 stars. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. :)

I've been using Ghostery for a long time and IMHO, this is the best version of the extension yet.

The new bigger panel makes it easier to see at a glance what trackers are present on the current website and it's also easier to check/uncheck blocking options.

The developers have also added the ability to see which blocked tracker is causing a web page not to function correctly.

That is a huge improvement over previous versions because it could take quite a long time to check/uncheck/reload the page to see which trackers, of which there are many on some websites, need to be unblocked for the web page to display correctly.

I wouldn't go anywhere on the web without this extension being loaded and active in my brower.

This is Most Excellent.

I'm a student and didn't think twice about the university website collecting data. Then I installed the extension and noticed the University home page loading in a fraction of the time. If you don't believe me then go to www.utas.edu.au and try loading it with and without the extension.

Essential app to help you take back control of the data you that you constantly leak to online businesses, but does it in such a way that it is also beneficial to businesses!! A Win-Win-Win! My only Annoyance is that it opens up the ghostery Welcome Page on every load of chrome...

Generally a good app. It breaks a few things. I found that I couldn't review apps on the web store with ghostery enabled. Pressing the review button just caused the button to change color, but the box didn't open. Not bad enough to cause me to uninstall it, I just disable it if something doesn't work, then re-enable it later.

I'd heard about Ghostery before, but had never tried it as I thought that the extensions I was using were more than adequate, I was wrong.

Since installing Ghostery, my browser has been loading pages faster than previous.

bug
I have used Ghostery for about 6 months now and love it. Ghostery gives you so much control over what you do or don't want to see. Site loading and flash players both go quickly and smoothly now. I initially started using Ghostery because I was tired of the ongoing competition between ads and my flash player over loading time. I was getting choppy flash player display whenever a new ad would load. You can choose exactly what you want to block and Ghostery regularly updates the bug list. You can see exactly what scripts are being blocked on each site (if you want) and what type of information they are meant to collect. The biggest plus for me about Ghostery is that you don't even notice it's there except for the lack of flashing banners and obnoxious auto-audio in video ads. It is the silent guardian of your internet browser. You have the option to get more notifications about activity if you want, but for people like me that just want a bit of peace from the advertisements, it does all of the work without bragging about it. After using it on my home computer for a couple of weeks, I went ahead and added Ghostery to my work computer as well, with equally satisfactory results. I highly recommend this program.

Very Handy app to weed out all the bloatware cookies that can slow down a site loading whilst your browsing it can also with one click allow the background software and adware cookies that is helpful to remain and not keep asking you if you wanna block them so i like it its surprising how many programs use background software that is no good to you or you just dont need them anymore!

The best- awesome how it tells you who's tracking you and what type they are. Works beautifully! How wonderful to know that the trackers are now unable to track you anymore-thanks to Ghostery!

A little problem- sometimes there are little extension errors if you already have AVAST  online protection. Sometimes Ghostery overpowers it a little. Your settings icon will flash orange, but that's it. If you ignore it, nothing will happen! That's all, nothing much.

It is very much recommended!

Tried several privacy/blocker extensions over the past week and found Ghostery to be the best for what it catches and for the great level of configurability.
Auto updating with auto-block and notification is really nice to have and Click-To-Play helps a lot to quickly find things that you want to unblock & gain access to.
Now I've got it installed on every pc at home and work.  Great tool guys!

This extension is amazing. I use it as an adblocker even sites such as pandora that tell you to upgrade to remove ads doesn't have ads. It can be as basic or as complex as you want. I recommend taking the time to adjust the settings when you first get it. 

WORD OF CAUTION!!! 
DO NOT GO IN AND BLOCK EVERYTHING. SOME SITES REQUIRE TRACKERS TO RUN PROPERLY. YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF LOGGING IN CONSTANTLY OR NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE SITE AT ALL. YOU WILL BE SEEING THE NUMBERS 404 VERY OFTEN. 

Just basicly know what you are doing when you block stuff and you should be fine.
-------------------------
break
This is the best ad blocker I have used. Yes some sites break, but it gives you the option to "Allow once" to get the page the first time and then most of the time that is sufficient. For sites that won't play you can allow individual exceptions. Updates itself regularly, Very easy to use. With 20 years in IT this is the BEST... so far!

I really would recommend it.

I've been getting sick of ad-blockers in recent months.  One sold out to a company that was letting (paying) advertisers circumvent the block, another broke browser functionality (such as the back button) and another always did a terrible job of getting rid of the frames containing the ads.

What annoys me most though is the lack of transparency.  While Ghostery isn't perfect (it also occasionally fails to remove blocked ad frames which take up precious screen real-estate), it is completely transparent and allows you to keep ads from those organisations not considered problematic.

Advertising is GOOD for the internet because many sites wouldn't be able to exist without it, but it is BAD when used for more nefarious purposes.  Being given a selective choice is liberating and that is ultimately when I like Ghostery so much.

Ghostery's professionally designed, intuitive UI and low memory footprint are merely added bonuses.

This is an amazing little app. It truly blocks all of the tracking software that normally loads in the background without your knowledge while surfing the internet. It is an eye opener to see just how much data is being exchanged behind the scenes. It also speeds up my Chrome browser to a degree. I will never browse the net again without this type of protection. just give it a try and I am sure you will come to the same conclusion!

Ghostery has fast become an essential companion to either of the foremost AdBlock(er) extensions on Chrome.  Updates are frequent and the developer seems to have a great deal of integrity.  If I could pay a little in exchange for a request, the request would be to sync settings with my google account so white listed items, etc. only have to be entered once.  of course, the ability to prevent syncing with particular devices would be helpful as my work pc settings could effectively "break" my ability to browse, say Netflix, at home.

Have a few problems with some sites so I turn it off for the few minutes I need to & then turn it back on. Not a problem for the protection it provides. Further the information about how to get Google, etc. to stop collecting information on you is great. I've forwarded it to my friends.

Enlightened, finally. Forewarned is forearmed.

So far as I can tell, this ext has kept a keen watch on all sorts of prying eyes trying to follow, map, catalog, and analyze my webehavior. 

Not only is it very good at finding the newest snitches on the block, it's very easy to control who's allowed access, who's not, etc., in 4 distinct categories of snoopery. 

This superb app works as advertised and is a force multiplier when used in combination with one or two related extensions (Collusion Graph is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for educational purposes; however, the magnitude of the prying and spying is spectacular in a "Nazi mass gathering in N√ºrnburg in the '30s" sorta way.

Thank you so much. 

To anyone who is interested in browsing the web without the web 'browsing' you this extension is for you. If you'd like to be as a ghost and flit in and out of websites without them knowing, install this and watch in wonder as all kinds of trackers are disabled.

Even in a world that seems hell bent on tracking what everyone does, it is nice to see that someone is into the opposite.  Too bad some websites refuse to allow access unless they can drop tracking cookies.

Very useful and cookie/ads selective app that can be tailored to your needs.

Ghostery is a gem of an extension/app. Highly recommended.

javascript
I'm a big fan, having used this for a while.  The challenge for Ghostery is so many terrible websites out there that use JavaScript to force trackers, popups, and other bad behavior in the name of "User Experience" - which usually means "seeing what the marketing department wants you to see".  Its had some minor bugs, but they fix it regularly and I really have no complaints.  they are a small group working against some of the largest companies in the world.  well done, Ghostery!

I really like Ghostery. I use it on Chrome and Android. It has evolved really well through the years. I combine it with Adblock Pro (not AB Plus!!!) and between the two of them my internet time is a pleasure! 

I have had some recent issues where Ghostery borks the Adblock Pro extension and I have to go in and manually re-enable ABP. Not a big deal, but deduct a star for that.

Still, a great extension, especially if you take a little time to understand how it works and tweak your settings.

I've used Ghostery for quite a while.  I was in love with version 6 and tbh I was taken aback by the new UI.   But once I "got" the idea of the new interface it started working for me.

It is so simple!  You can simply turn off all trackers and Ghostery will tell you if the site is not working correctly ("broken pages") because of the trackers you've turned off and allow you to turn on just the trackers you need to get the site working.  Very cool.

There are some other features from v6 I'd like to see - like Beacons - but I hear they'll be back in a future version - all-in-all, this is a very good product with a simple, powerful interface.

Amazing.  
I saw this extension reviews and had to get it.
I was shocked to see how many sites are tracking my every move, even after choosing "opt out" with Google.

I would like to see an "auto add" feature, so that I didn't have to manually flip the switch every time the program finds a new tracker.

And also, if you already have a tracker blocked, I would like that tracker to NOW show in the list of trackers blocked (it's a pop up window).

I still give it 5 stars because I can now have control who does and doesn't see me!

something that i'd love to see is an option to narrow down ads. We don't wanna starve off websites, do we? but if you could block ads that are deemed "obnoxious" and keep the non-obnoxious ads, it'd be great! i absolutely love this! works like a assasin rather than a viking!

This app is so good I would actually PAY for it (though I am quite happy to use it for free too!). It's like every web page I go to is ad free. An occasional ad here or there isn't bad, but nowadays it's like you have to search through the ads to find it. Ghostery works great in keeping the ads in check. For me, I just make sure I keep on the "widgets" but turn off all the tracking, advertisement and beacons. Very well done Ghostery team. I am curious to know however if turning off the various items also means that those items can't install cookies? My assumption would be that they can't since they can't see you.

I don't have a deep understanding of them and have just turned them all off (with the understanding that I can click-to-play where it blocks content I might want to see).

Amazing extension. I only use a few extensions (and have tested over 100 throughout my time switching from Firefox to Chrome) and this made the cut. It performs exactly what it states that it will do, no more and no less; which sadly is more than you can say for a lot of extensions throughout many different browsers. The popups did get annoying but eventually I turned them off and sometimes I do mess around with it because it can become very useful. It is easy to add a website to the whitelist so you can keep their trackers running -- and again there are only a few sites out of the many I visit that I allow them to use their tracker(s) - I find this extension very useful and it would receive a 5 star rating and will as soon as or if they do change their popup feature to be more user friendly and not as annoying as it currently is when turned on.

If you want some added protection that's not restricted to your browser you should check out www.peerblock.com I block entire countries, spyware, trojans and all kinds of things that go bump in the night but everything you use is NOT fool proof.

While no anti-tracking tool is perfect, you can at least make it more difficult for the would-be trackers to profile your browsing behavior. 

The interface is clean, polished, and intuitive. You can always temporarily pause blocking if you find a certain site's functionality is reduced. You can also whitelist sites you trust. Since new trackers are always being created, the app auto-updates the blacklist periodically (though you can disable this if you want). It also seems to work well with other plugins.

I find Ghostery, Adblock Plus, and ScriptSafe (along with some common sense) are the most essential plugins for safe browsing and eliminate 95% of the most annoying parts of browsing the web.

the list of stuff ghostery stops is awesome! i've got it on all of my email accounts, and i love it!

Ghostery has fast become an essential companion to either of the foremost AdBlock(er) extensions on Chrome.  Updates are frequent and the developer seems to have a great deal of integrity.  If I could pay a little in exchange for a request, the request would be to sync settings with my google account so white listed items, etc. only have to be entered once.  of course, the ability to prevent syncing with particular devices would be helpful as my work pc settings could effectively "break" my ability to browse, say Netflix, at home.
-------------------------
list
Love it! When I went to common sites (facebook, CNN...) list of trackers was incredible. I like the ability to decide what info I give out.
-------------------------
list
Really love this app. Prefer it over any of the other ad-blockers. 

Some of the things I liked:
1. Very intuitive user interface.
2. Does its job well.
3. Shows you the lists the trackers it blocked.
-------------------------
whitelist
This is a great app, I've tried a few of the tracker blocker apps and found this one better than all the rest, it picks up double the stuff that the others do and I find it real easy to use. I noticed another review on here by someone complaining that they found themselves constantly fiddling with the settings? I can only assume that they don't really understand browsers/apps because Ghostery is really very simple to use, easy to whitelist sites that you don't mind tracking you, even whitelist individual trackers. You can set it to show you as much or as little information you want from showing you every tracker on every site to  practically invisible. I can't recommend it enough, it's the best I've found.
-------------------------
whitelist
Ghostery gives a fantastic level of control over what is being done with your sacred personal information. The whitelist feature lets websites that rely on legitimate 3rd party services work and being able to whitelist domains right from the toolbar is great.

If you install only one extension, install Ghostery.
-------------------------
whitelist
An incredibly useful, no frills tool. Some parts of sights won't work when it is enabled, but there is a whitelist option. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
whitelist
Highly useful Chrome/Firefox extension that suppresses the _loading_ of tracking and ad code everywhere. You can whitelist domains and/or particular trackers/beacons/ads. Also, it's auto-updating with the option to auto-block everything new.
-------------------------
whitelist
Amazing extension. I only use a few extensions (and have tested over 100 throughout my time switching from Firefox to Chrome) and this made the cut. It performs exactly what it states that it will do, no more and no less; which sadly is more than you can say for a lot of extensions throughout many different browsers. The popups did get annoying but eventually I turned them off and sometimes I do mess around with it because it can become very useful. It is easy to add a website to the whitelist so you can keep their trackers running -- and again there are only a few sites out of the many I visit that I allow them to use their tracker(s) - I find this extension very useful and it would receive a 5 star rating and will as soon as or if they do change their popup feature to be more user friendly and not as annoying as it currently is when turned on.

Just have to enable tracker blocking. It defaults to NO blocking, in case some users are not aware of this.

Easy to manage, leave the setting on default. Easy to use, once enabled Ghostery does the work and does it well. Thank you for keeping my privacy, private and the peace of mind I get from seeing all those trackers derailed

Amazing piece of software.  I do wish they'd disable the alert bubble by default, NO ONE wants to see that every single time they navigate to a page.

Excellent tool for both blocking tracking sites and web application pop-ups. Easy to configure if the default are not to your liking and anything it adds to the browser can be hidden or removed.
-------------------------

imo ghostery is much better than donottrackme and it is more concise in firefox than chrome ... wish all the blockers were enabled by default though, you do need to make sure you configure it after install and select update elements automatically in advanced settings

The default settings can be a bit annoying because it will show pop-ups telling you everything it's doing but the UI is easy to navigate and turn them off/on to your liking.

An absolutely brilliant little thing. Very easy to use and does what it says.

You have to first make some easy setting changes then this becomes an awesome tool.

1 - Under General/Trackers to block: Block everything

2- Under Advanced:
Uncheck "Show Alert Bubble"
Check "Block new elements by default"
-------------------------

So far so good. Didn't know there were that many invisible trackers out there. I'm letting the app basically do it's default blocking until or if I run into any problems..This will be a 5 if all remains well.

I'm a big fan, having used this for a while.  The challenge for Ghostery is so many terrible websites out there that use JavaScript to force trackers, popups, and other bad behavior in the name of "User Experience" - which usually means "seeing what the marketing department wants you to see".  Its had some minor bugs, but they fix it regularly and I really have no complaints.  they are a small group working against some of the largest companies in the world.  well done, Ghostery!

I should have installed this ages ago! Ghostery gives users total control over which trackers to block, lets you individualize rules per domain or per tracker and it shows all the trackers available.

The app is very transparent, the UI is intuitive and the tutorial explains all the features. I'm keeping this.

Does its job but slows down the browser. I removed it and immediately noticed a speed boost on ALL webpages.

This app by far exceeded my expectations.  I was having hidden malware in my Chrome browser that had been very difficult to keep at bay.

Ghostery is a very much appreciated and valued app for today's browsers.

I'd heard about Ghostery before, but had never tried it as I thought that the extensions I was using were more than adequate, I was wrong.

Since installing Ghostery, my browser has been loading pages faster than previous.

You will be AMAZED at how much insidious tracking is being done on your browser activity by 100's and 100's of trackers, beacons, and stuff I didn't even know existed. This app blocks ALL of it, and makes it easy to select exceptions on the fly. This is one of the absolute best apps for any browser, and my advice: don't even think about getting on the web without it.

I have used Ghostery for about 6 months now and love it. Ghostery gives you so much control over what you do or don't want to see. Site loading and flash players both go quickly and smoothly now. I initially started using Ghostery because I was tired of the ongoing competition between ads and my flash player over loading time. I was getting choppy flash player display whenever a new ad would load. You can choose exactly what you want to block and Ghostery regularly updates the bug list. You can see exactly what scripts are being blocked on each site (if you want) and what type of information they are meant to collect. The biggest plus for me about Ghostery is that you don't even notice it's there except for the lack of flashing banners and obnoxious auto-audio in video ads. It is the silent guardian of your internet browser. You have the option to get more notifications about activity if you want, but for people like me that just want a bit of peace from the advertisements, it does all of the work without bragging about it. After using it on my home computer for a couple of weeks, I went ahead and added Ghostery to my work computer as well, with equally satisfactory results. I highly recommend this program.

I've been getting sick of ad-blockers in recent months.  One sold out to a company that was letting (paying) advertisers circumvent the block, another broke browser functionality (such as the back button) and another always did a terrible job of getting rid of the frames containing the ads.

What annoys me most though is the lack of transparency.  While Ghostery isn't perfect (it also occasionally fails to remove blocked ad frames which take up precious screen real-estate), it is completely transparent and allows you to keep ads from those organisations not considered problematic.

Advertising is GOOD for the internet because many sites wouldn't be able to exist without it, but it is BAD when used for more nefarious purposes.  Being given a selective choice is liberating and that is ultimately when I like Ghostery so much.

Ghostery's professionally designed, intuitive UI and low memory footprint are merely added bonuses.

The new interface is brilliant and aesthetically pleasing... good job developers...

This is an amazing little app. It truly blocks all of the tracking software that normally loads in the background without your knowledge while surfing the internet. It is an eye opener to see just how much data is being exchanged behind the scenes. It also speeds up my Chrome browser to a degree. I will never browse the net again without this type of protection. just give it a try and I am sure you will come to the same conclusion!

I love this extension!! 
Addblock uses 50-80MB RAM and its slowing my browser a lot.
I have 20+ tabs opened  and Ghostery uses 10-20MB

What can be said - where have you been all this time! Unbelievable how much is tracked - Ghostery is a perfect tool to control what you want shared about you. I've been using G. on various computers and browsers, it works fine.

Great extension !! I use it on all my browsers now !!!! Thanks for this.

It works as specified, however everytime it blocks something a pop-up 'sub-balloon' appears over a small portion of the page. I wish it would allow me to click it's icon for that balloon. Also, this extension seems to open it's update info page every time it does something (constant updates?) whether it blocks something, or reports something, or even when I just open my browser. I wish this thing would be less ... in view.  Irritations aside, this is a solid "host.deny" or ".allow" style software cop. Thanks for making this!
-------------------------
browser
I've been using Ghostery for many years.  I'm always impressed with its features, completeness and ease of use compared to other ad-blockers.  The only additional configuration needed when setting up is moving the alert box from top-right corner and checking boxes for autoupdate and autoblock for new threats to my privacy.

One of the essential apps for any browser.

This is a really cool extension. . . Although I knew websites were collecting loads of information on me when I browsed, I never knew it was this much! I'm going to continue to use it on Chrome (which is my main browser) and on Firefox as well.

Thank you so much. 

To anyone who is interested in browsing the web without the web 'browsing' you this extension is for you. If you'd like to be as a ghost and flit in and out of websites without them knowing, install this and watch in wonder as all kinds of trackers are disabled.

If you want some added protection that's not restricted to your browser you should check out www.peerblock.com I block entire countries, spyware, trojans and all kinds of things that go bump in the night but everything you use is NOT fool proof.

P.S. don't get it from some download site. Make sure it's from peerblock dot com or you're going to get something you didn't want. @Lancepimpstrong ;)

All you need to know is this plugin was purchased by an advertising company.

Calls itself an anti-tracking tool, but it tracks you and sells your data itself.  It's an inherit part of the company's business model.  Go with privacy badger which is instead made by the EFF and therefore doesn't need to monetize it's user base.
-------------------------

It's a nice tool to see what's going on behind your back, because, you are, to the companies that "spy" on you, more or less anonymous. Many people who installed this are hoping to be ads-free on the net, but to them i can recommend this extension IN ADDITION to some great ad-blockers, that are script-blockers. A few good of those is AdBlock, AdBlock Plus (b√©ta), FlashBlock, etc. Pick a good one that has options that you can set webpages as you want on that domain, they even block ALL ADS like on YouTube, or other video sites that got those annoying loud ads. They are the past with them. For your privacy traces, is suggest another very great extension, and that's Click&Clean, it has tons of possibilities, to see everything in Chrome, or your computer. You get 1 button, click on it, and you can manage everything about Chrome, record things, take snapshots, etc, etc. But the best thing is it's main reason for you, and that's CLEANING your surf TRACES, CLEANING ALL or ONLY THE RANDOME COOCKIES, KEEP ALL IMPORTANT YOUR PASSWORDS, FORM DATA, and erase things you want. It also has a great option, where you can click on what, how, when to clean-up. Even when you close Chrome, it then asks remove history, etc.? All with a memory. BUT KEEP GHOSTERY, because who's SPYING ON YOU, those scripts aren't blocked that easy. Because you DON'T SEE THEM, so it doesn't annoy you, but they are there. And GHOSTERY will pinpoint them out for you! Read GHOST. FAQ, and you'll find it all out very easy! Thank you, GHOSTERY, to keep guard for us, and telling us who's peering, spying on us all!!! Succes!!

I've been using Ghostery ever since I heard about it a while back, Countless and unimaginable amounts of data and time have been saved because of Ghostery. Successfully allowing the marketers I am wanting to ALLOW vs them not having permission and still placing themselves thru a backdoor cookie, the intrusion and data pulled across so many layers of digital unknowns. (It's disturbing to find out the $ value for just one person on one website;if being specific one of the big players says you are worth exactly $13.00. So, I am happy that this exists. Perhaps a pizzagate preventing script could be  on the horizon expanding Ghostery's capabilitys. Id love to have it prevent me from reading fake news stories. False information = 0 ... This is art in its highest form. Smart technology that is worth the investment to use. Couldn't say enough kudos to the men and women who work and continue to work on this. Thanks folks. Keep up the good work.

This is Most Excellent.

I'm a student and didn't think twice about the university website collecting data. Then I installed the extension and noticed the University home page loading in a fraction of the time. If you don't believe me then go to www.utas.edu.au and try loading it with and without the extension.

holy furballs... i can block ads WITHOUT being known i'm blocking ads! for instance, a resource website for gaming, they slow down people with ad blockers, i go there and BAM! no ads, no warning about adblocker, I will finally be able to save some data! great job, ghostery!
something that i'd love to see is an option to narrow down ads. We don't wanna starve off websites, do we? but if you could block ads that are deemed "obnoxious" and keep the non-obnoxious ads, it'd be great! i absolutely love this! works like a assasin rather than a viking!

Best blocker app I've used. I was concerned about the (rather ironic, IMO) tracking that Ghostery does on its users, but have since learned it's not a big issue (its anonymous aggregate data with the ability to opt-out if you wish). Especially considering how helpful the app is.
Browsing is a much more pleasant experience with this extension installed.

Wish it were available for Android, that would make all Chrome browsing ad and tracker-free!

It is an eye opener to see just how much data is being exchanged behind the scenes. It also speeds up my Chrome browser to a degree. I will never browse the net again without this type of protection. just give it a try and I am sure you will come to the same conclusion!

pretty cool tool for if not using firefox. jams the tracker links that compile all your personal data and sell it to others.

I meant "Adblock Plus", I must have got too excited,not "Adaware Plus", which I doubt exists. Are all adds and trackers denied access to my private data, or, like "Adblock Plus", are some privileged companies, chosen by the developer, allowed access because of their alleged integrity and I suspect, deep pockets, Thanks for seems to be a great addition to my security and peace of mind.

I like the interface and how you can see how many trackers are spotted.
Try for fun pausing ghostery on some sites and you will see how the number of trackers increases because in blocking mode Ghostery sees how many trackers the site itself uses. But whe those trackers are allowed to do their thing they all sneakily invite their friends and you end up with a higher tracker-count. And now we know why some sites are so slow.
I love Ghostery for this. It protects me and also tells me what is going on.

Ghostery's latest update adds a cleaner interface with more details and information. Blocking trackers, advertising, analytics, and actually explaining which ones they are. Running this along with ad-blocking you can create a fast, clean, safe internet experience! Great job guys.

holy furballs... i can block ads WITHOUT being known i'm blocking ads! for instance, a resource website for gaming, they slow down people with ad blockers, i go there and BAM! no ads, no warning about adblocker, I will finally be able to save some data! great job, ghostery!
something that i'd love to see is an option to narrow down ads. We don't wanna starve off websites, do we? but if you could block ads that are deemed "obnoxious" and keep the non-obnoxious ads, it'd be great! i absolutely love this! works like a assasin rather than a viking!

I have been using this plugin with Google Chrome for over 90 days now, and I am thoroughly impressed. Some of my favorite news websites, unfortunately, seem to have the most advertisements and pop-ups creating a slow and frustrating reading experience.

Ghostery has fixed this issue. At the click of a button the annoying ads and popups where gone, and the best part is that Ghostery remembers your settings for the site so you do not need to shut the ads down on your next visit!

As an IT Support and Computer Repair technician I spend a lot of time working with software. Ghostery is one of the rare applications that really delivers! I give Ghostery a thumbs up.

Very Handy app to weed out all the bloatware cookies that can slow down a site loading whilst your browsing it can also with one click allow the background software and adware cookies that is helpful to remain and not keep asking you if you wanna block them so i like it its surprising how many programs use background software that is no good to you or you just dont need them anymore!

Ghostery has fast become an essential companion to either of the foremost AdBlock(er) extensions on Chrome.  Updates are frequent and the developer seems to have a great deal of integrity.  If I could pay a little in exchange for a request, the request would be to sync settings with my google account so white listed items, etc. only have to be entered once.  of course, the ability to prevent syncing with particular devices would be helpful as my work pc settings could effectively "break" my ability to browse, say Netflix, at home.

This is very smart from a business perspective as the industry will be changing soon. I am glad to see that some companies like "Ghostery" here are playing fair, and treating their customers with respect and providing them the needed information to chose or invite. I like it! I have no problems in general with the industry of Social Marketing. As long as it's done fair, I know who is watching me, why, and who they mean to give that information to. If it's to make sites work better, or put up ads I may like. That is cool, but when I type in a search request and get taken to the outer mongol turf of the internet instead... It makes being on-line no fun and a chore. It also slows down my work or play, and some times I am researching a topic I want to keep private. I am just glad the industry has decided to self regulate, as change will be coming in a way no body believes possible. So it's better to straighten up and fly right now. Good job, congratulations on the new found sense of morals and true customer care. I think it's a great idea and program!

Works just fine especially the "block all unencrypted requests" feature. This takes away the hassle of writing "https://" prefix along with the address to know if the site has https connection and protects the user who are connected to a unsecured or public wi-fi. People misunderstands the use of this extension by thinking it "makes a HTTPS version" of the sites they are visiting.

bug
It worked pretty well, I never really had any issue with it, I made the mistake of thinking that'd it'd turn any site into a https encrypted site, but it only redirects you to the encrypted connection if it's available for that site. There may have been 1 or 2 times where it didn't work, but the fact that I don't recall it being faulty is probably because I haven't experienced any bugs. With that being said I wanted to thank the devs for informing it's users that most web browsers have this option set by default now or have the option to toggle it on. I'll be uninstalling this extension, but I appreciate the usefulness of the extension while it lasted.
-------------------------
break
When I installed this extension a 1 or 2 years ago, it was breaking many websites and it was tedious to fix these issues. I reinstalled it recently and it seems to have been improved since I didn't have any problem on any websites.

More HTTPS: good.
Lots of broken content: not so good.

This extension is really nice, but it doesn't have any options that you can configure.  It would be nice if you could add and remove sites that it operates on.  I'd like to be able to add other sites that I use frequently that have https versions.  I'd also like to remove some sites that it redirects to https, but the https version doesn't work (like one site gives you a redirect loop error when you try to go to it via https).  Without any way to configure this extension I have to disable it every time I want to go to one of the sites that it breaks.

Bottom line:  The https redirection works great and when they add the ability to configure it I'll give it 5 stars.
-------------------------

Awesome, Thank You very much. People are crying for controls when none are needed, some times to secure something you have to remove the human element. I love that this plug-in simply does what it says. "you know the saying "If it aint broke, don't fix it"

Useful extension to have alongside uBlock Origin & others in order to reduce the work it takes to identify and block all scripts. I basically use the free version to block the "social media" scripts & plugins various sites use without doing it manually (as in uMatrix or advanced mode of uBO). I'm subtracting points because it's not very effective entirely on the goals they declare in the description, but it's a useful tool to keep alongside several other tools.

Just very insightful and feel a bit more protected from all those seemingly millions of internet prying eyes.
-------------------------
protect
One of, if not, the best of privacy extensions to have in the modern age of data mining, carving and harvesting. I've used this for a long time and it's chockload of options from full black/whitelisting of sites/pages and fully customisable plugin loading if a page/site requires some plugins to run for full functionality. Protects privacy, improves loading times, conserves bandwidth amongst other things. Obviously, it may work better for some more than others but give it a shot and dig deep into the options for best results.

Pretty good. only thing is that it blocked ghostery.

Works well and everything, makes google chrome a lot more stable on older computers too, also seems to block viruses like savemass and such, I recommended it for sure
-------------------------
block
Works great, easy to whitelist certain things such as Google Inbox, and it shows you clearly what was blocked and why.
-------------------------
block
I'd like to see Disconnect add a one-button disable feature.  Occasionally I wish to view a discussion and hate having to either hit all 7 unblocks or manually messing with each one to determine which one (or combination) is blocking access.

Otherwise, Disconnect works fairly well.
-------------------------

Sometimes blocks functions in my browser, but otherwise pretty neat.

best extension so far always helpful for blocking useless stuff
-------------------------

-makes loading pages faster
-easy to block/unblock facebook and twitter buttons

i love it, block annoyance material
-------------------------

There is some conflict with normal Flash (not Pepflash) although overall pretty good. There's also no option to  *not* default block ads though.
-------------------------
block
As it blocks, it tells you who is trying to track you.
-------------------------
block
Great extension! In fact one of the better ones in the market right now, it truly blocks ads and trackers that other extensions don't even notice. That being said it's too intrusive (not in the normal sense of the word) because sometimes it blocks HTML and Flash content that isn't unwanted which causes annoying interruptions since you have to disable the extension or give every specific webpage permissions. If you fix this, I will rate this app 5 starts cause its really good other than what I just described.
-------------------------
block
Love this app. Make sure you watch their videos. on youtube. It will show you how to block and unblock sites. shows the list of sites tracking you. Pages load faster and get rid of ads on the site. I donate to the company and learned who the guys are that started this company. well worth it.
-------------------------
block
Really good application. Doesn't track me while blocking trackers, encrypting web data, and speeding up page load time. You don't have to donate when you install it despite what it looks like disconnect.me would appreciate it if you would share the application instead or subscribe to them on a social media website. I plan to donate for the extension and use the search engine for Disconnect as soon as possible.

Great extension! Very well done!
-------------------------
block
This extension does a very thorough job of both protecting privacy and increasing performance by blocking unnecessary tracking traffic.
-------------------------
block
Great one. I would replace Ghostery with Disconnect if I was able to block the "content section" by default.
Also an option menu to manage white-listing would be neat.
Looking forward to see theses features in an update
-------------------------

This is such a great plugin, I pray to god it is secure since it needs to see everything to block elements which track you.
-------------------------

Looks good, remember if you disable things you can block social functionality on sites.

It's pretty good, says it's blocking stuff on almost every site I go to. So, I guess it's working- I can't really tell the difference! But thanks!

prevent
Simple, elegant way to prevent unwanted third party and tracking cookies. If you are like me and would just like to control what you can (and not someone who thinks the government is tracking your grocery purchases through the cardboard sim card in your prepaid phone) this is a great idea. I noticed people mentioning that certain sites dont work after installing- you just need to add it to the permissible list and change your settings to be a little less restrictive and your services will work again. I went through this with my gmail acct. Anyway, this is a must have for peace of mind.
-------------------------

works like a charm! was surprised to see the number of trackers that this app blocked as i was surfing the web,and it was just a usual day, usual websites!

Great App. just... can you add youtube widgets to block list?

I love the fact that this extension blocks all of these annoying behaviors.  It's excellent in that respect.  The only downside is that I could not be logged into both gmail and calendar simultaneously in different tabs with the "depersonalize searches" box checked.  Fix that and it's perfect, imo.
-------------------------
block
Great extension.  One suggestion for a future version, though - could you add a configurable list of domains on which it won't attempt the blocking?

For example, I would like to have Disconnect generally enabled, but disable itself when I'm using my Twitter/Facebook client so that I can see people's avatars.

Cuts time to load pages by even more than the 27% claim, seems like 50% to me. My favorite chrome extension. my most useful chrome extension. It is only because I have disconnect that it is possible for me to have 130 extensions installed and still browse at decent speed. always works, never crashes, and speeds up browsing very noticeably.

Wow, it actually works. And it works good. It will keep tap of tracking cookies and block them if it finds the same cookie on 3 sites you visit.

A nice vpn like Mullvad is probably not too shabby either.

Amazing extension, a perfect addition to an ad blocker. A lot of websites these days will block access to their website if they detect an adblocker. With Privacy Badger you'll fly under the radar:-) In general I'm not against ads and understand that websites that provide valuable info need to make money but the tracking of a user across the web has gotten out of control. I'm glad that EFF came up with a solution to stop the madness. Thank you.
-------------------------

FANTASTIC app for killing tracking sites and cookies.  I use it WITH AdBlock Plus and Disconnect.  All 3 in combination is a PERFECT way to have full control of security.  I personally also recommend blocking cookies and javascript BY DEFAULT and only allow it on sites you want/intend to visit.

I just installed so I'll give it ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê for now. Is there a way to enable a tracker on one site, but block it elsewhere? Umatrix is able to do that. For example allowing reddit resources on reddit, but blocking them on all other sites.

Love this addon, works very well.  But I really wish there was a default settings to make this more aggressive.  It basically fully allows almost everything.  If you go to download.cnet.com for example all the ads and video players load all lsited as tracking domains.  WOuld be great if privacy badger could be set to block or block cookies on all 3rd party domains by default.
-------------------------
block
It works great! I would love it if there was a counter to show how many trackers have been blocked since the beginning.
-------------------------

Mostly good and I applaud the effort.
One warning: It can 'break' podcast sites like Overcast.fm if www.podtrac.com is used.
I backed off the setting on www.podtrac.com from 'Blocked' to 'Block cookies' (red to yellow) to get around it, for better or worse...
-------------------------
block
Many people have complained about the sensitivity of PrivacyBadger, but I've always found it very usable. When applications *do* break, adjusting settings is easy while the application learns the 'right' thing to do.

PrivacyBadger is here to protect your *PRIVACY*, not to remove Ads. Many sites are operated by ad revenue and it's shortsighted to block these important opportunities to fund the site, provided they aren't including third-party tracking cookies and assets: A goal where PrivacyBadger is second-to-none.

Many 'commercial' Adblockers today are just play-to-pay schemes, willing to compromise your security (and browsing experience) for the right dollar, some going as far as to *sell* your personal information and browsing habits after-the-fact.

Like the way that it learns as it goes. Never felt completely comfortable with everything blocked in ABP or Ghostery since they rendered many sites in error or non-functional. Wasn't such a big deal for me but made it problematic for less experienced user. Privacy Badger is easy to use for advanced users that want to block everything but still offers good protection AND functionality to users who just prefer to browse.

Previous version was great, this version (as of Aug 8, 2015) does not let me block google, facebook or twitter. Sliding the sliders to yellow or red do nothing, they simply stay on green.

I'm glad that EFF came up with a solution to stop the madness. Thank you.

Great extension makes the browser load and render pages so much faster. i think you should make your own adblocker to work along side it that way we can be sure it will be something that won't slow down the page load and render speed.

Indispensible, amazing extension. It does break many pages, but you can just enable the sources you want and it reloads the page. It's incredible how many trackers some pages have!
-------------------------

The Rotten Tomatoes web-page which I use extensively started to open with no pictures.  I suspected cookies & so cleared them out but to no avail.  The next suspect was extensions &, as this was the last one added, I switched off & voila!  Rotten Tomatoes is now loading correctly.

Having 'all else failed', I've now read the instructions & disabled PB on Rotten's site & all is well. Doh!

A fantastic Anti-Tracking option that is far less intrusive than most and much simpler to manage & use without breaking website functionality... This is why I recommend this particular app to all my family & friends.  Keep up the Good Work EFF!!

When I have this enabled, I'm unable to view images on Google Docs, they just show up as white space. When the doc loads, it says "Some fonts could not be loaded." For now, I have to disable the app, but otherwise it's great.

Love this addon, works very well.  But I really wish there was a default settings to make this more aggressive.  It basically fully allows almost everything.

WOuld be great if privacy badger could be set to block or block cookies on all 3rd party domains by default.

One warning: It can 'break' podcast sites like Overcast.fm if www.podtrac.com is used.
I backed off the setting on www.podtrac.com from 'Blocked' to 'Block cookies' (red to yellow) to get around it, for better or worse...
-------------------------
break
Many people have complained about the sensitivity of PrivacyBadger, but I've always found it very usable. When applications *do* break, adjusting settings is easy while the application learns the 'right' thing to do.

PrivacyBadger is here to protect your *PRIVACY*, not to remove Ads. Many sites are operated by ad revenue and it's shortsighted to block these important opportunities to fund the site, provided they aren't including third-party tracking cookies and assets: A goal where PrivacyBadger is second-to-none.

Many 'commercial' Adblockers today are just play-to-pay schemes, willing to compromise your security (and browsing experience) for the right dollar, some going as far as to *sell* your personal information and browsing habits after-the-fact.
-------------------------
break
It works well and does what it says. It also breaks a lot of sites. However, when a site is broke by this extension I wonder why the site needs the information it is asking for. Then if you trust the site with that info, allow it to track and the site starts working again.
-------------------------
bug
Five stars all day...except for the regular crashes.
I love what this extension does, and the functionality is great...when it functions. It occasionally just stops working, and nothing will load until I uninstall it. After seeing how many sites are tracking me, though, I keep reinstalling it. Fix the bugs, and this is five stars all day.
-------------------------
load
Dislike the general concept of blacklisting based on traffic analysis. Gave it a shot and waited a day of full browsing. Many many obvious trackers were still being loaded. Perhaps waiting longer will eventually fix this...not sure. But what a gamble. Eventual maybe privacy is not acceptable.

I trust eff far more than I do Ghostery, but Ghostery just works.
-------------------------
error
Like the way that it learns as it goes. Never felt completely comfortable with everything blocked in ABP or Ghostery since they rendered many sites in error or non-functional. Wasn't such a big deal for me but made it problematic for less experienced user. Privacy Badger is easy to use for advanced users that want to block everything but still offers good protection AND functionality to users who just prefer to browse.
-------------------------
break
Really solid tracker blocker- sometimes breaks sites and you have to adjust settings- may confuse anyone who isn't a web dev.  Does a nice job of fairly comprensnsive blocking of major trackers.
-------------------------
stop
Does what it supposed to do. Of course, some sites try to prevent this and stop working, but that's not the addon's fault.
-------------------------
bug
As a developer of the extension I am certainly biased, but I've been running the alpha release in my main browser for a few months, and it works very well for me.

We'll be monitoring the reviews here for bugs and trying to get those fixed as quickly as possible!

manual
You may not realise that it's a 5 star extension, until you try other tracker-blocker extensions.

Once you see how much they demand from the user, how slowly they adapt to new trackers and how little they allow you to see which trackers are permitted or not, you will cherish privacy badger dearly in comparison. It helps you tweak it with ease and after a few manual tweaks, it begins automaticlaly adapting to your style of hating tracking vs not minding tracking.

If you want to surf securely and get rid of annoying or +18 ads, this extension is the solution. Block anything you want without Adblock Detectors.

It is amazing, it works exactly as expected and above all, it can replace dozens of other extensions like blocking canvas, webrtc, youtube ads, etc. Obviously, some fine tuning by the user is constantly required, since it blocks all scripts.

This is an excellent and safe way to browse the internet. It allows me to make intelligent choices about who and what has access to my browser and its contents.

This has been an excellent tool and I applaud the author for his hard work.

I have been using this for a couple of years now and - once correctly configured - this extension provides great protection from script based threats.

block
I'm giving 5 star for this. one of most best extension I had, it can detect trackers, ads and many many more. People thought it is not user friendly, and they think its bugged but actually it is because on the scripts we allowed or blocked. :)
and one more thing you can click the bar below the scripts name "Rating", it will take you on wot site and see the rating of the scripts. This is totally perfect for those who knows how to use scripts. just sharing my experience.

PS.can I request, can you create a vertical scroll bar on popup the extension, because I'm visiting site with many scripts but my screen is very small. Thank you
-------------------------
block
I'm using this with Google's Chrome Dev Channel build and it works quite well.

I've been a Firefox user for years and had been going back to Firefox because of the NoScript Add-On. If you're familiar with NoScript on Firefox you'll quickly find this useful and about as intuitive as NoScript.

One thing I really like about Firefox's latest Nightly build is that, by default when connecting to a site via https, Firefox will block all insecure elements.

AdBlock Plus is available for Chrome and now I have a NoScript equivalent. For the first time in many Tech years I've set a different browser to be my default.
-------------------------
block
Very good extension, especially in times of social network terror on every page you visit. This will also slow down traffic. BUt unfortunately it doesn't block all iframes.
-------------------------
block
A great software. I used to use NoScript on Firefox to avoid unwanted content like bg music and many. ScriptNo does the same and works like a charm. While I have a little suggestion, would you consider setting a whitelist for files? I need to look up some literature on web thus view many .pdf using Chrome. ScriptNo on default blocked them all for me, could you allow a setting such that I can unblock all .pdf link by default? Thanks for your kind attention.

Wonderful extension.  Hwever I wish there was a way to allow all TLD's (Top Level Domains) but block all else, just like in NoScript for firefox.

popup
I'm using this extension for a couple of months now and have always been happy. Since a recent update, I always get pop-ups on my screen saying that it there is an update available, or that it has been synched. I deactivated those popups in the settings, and restarted the browser several times, but the pop-up still shows.

I'll give 5* if this issue is fixed.

Really like this extension.  Great work.

Just one small bug to report, after changing permissions and using the little blue button on the dialog to reload, the page will reload again when the toolbar button is pressed (even without additional changes made).
-------------------------
load
Just recently (past week/since new updates) youtube has been taking like 10-15 seconds to load pages. I'm pretty sure that's the only site i've noticed this on so far. I also backed up my settings and re-installed the extension to no luck :/

Not sure what else to do, or if some options are conflicting with each other. I looked at some of the reviews and I guess you're going to be fixing the performance and other issues people have brought up in next patch.

been using your extension for years, glad to see you active again. I also really like your website! Lots of useful information and cool projects :D
-------------------------
bug
I used to love this extension. Was near perfect until the flood of updates started. Now I'm noticing serious spikes in cpu usage (almost 40% on an i7? Seriously?) along with a host of other problems that others here have already pointed out. I've restarted chrome every time an update pops up, and still find myself enduring these headaches. 

I love that you are still supporting this extension, and do not want to sound ungrateful. But I fear that these rushed updates could be causing more instability than they are fixing. Personally I may stop using this extension for a time, with hopes of returning to a more complete and bug tested version in the future. I make a terrible guinea pig. Sorry, and thank you.
-------------------------
access
This is an excellent and safe way to browse the internet. It allows me to make intelligent choices about who and what has access to my browser and its contents. It even blocks things naturally on my favorite sites and tells me what it is blocking! I can progress through levels of allowance and only allow main site functionality or I can easily trust for just a session or entirely trust forever! This has been an excellent tool and I applaud the author for his hard work.

A Brilliant Extension! This  is just what I was looking for days after my chrome browser was terribly affected by browser hijackers. It's easy and flexible to use and does perform incredibly superior to other alternatives and other AdBlockers.

Great work.. Love it!!

Works well. Seems to have more fine-grained script access control compared to NoScript. And does not require setting a password, unlike that one.

error
Amazing extension.
Requires User Knowledge to use effectively and quickly.

It is not for everyone but works. If you have the patience to see what it takes to learn about scripts, cookies etc, it will be part trial and error, part reading about sites and looking at the links.

Would only recommend to those wanting to get frustrated before finding enjoyment in it's effect.
-------------------------
load
Really good control of all the scripts that would run on the computer.  Really makes my browsing experience more secure and configured right you can make it so that all the ads do not even load, though for a cost of taking time to configure it correctly.  Over all if you are a power user and want some more control this extension is for you.
-------------------------
load
Very Nice! If your knowledge of scripts is low you'll most likely uninstall out of frustration.  With that in the clear i'm glad to have control of which scripts and when if any a page can load, and this extension does a great job for Chrome in my humble opinion.  Keep up the good work and thanks!
-------------------------
error
I really like this add-on.  I can understand some of the complaints of this being "too complicated", this add-on takes a little time to get running smoothly.  Especially on more complicated sites (i.e. Youtube, Facebook, some news sites) that run lots of scripts, it can take some time to figure out what scripts you want running that are actually important to the function of the website.  This is just a matter of setting certain ones as "Temp" and seeing what effect it has.  The trial and error can be frustrating, but it's worth it.  Once you get it going on your most visited websites, the experience is flawless!

I don't know what you did, but you broke this formerly awesome extension.

A definite improvement over Notscript, which hasn't been updated in two years. This one installs by itself, works perfectly so far, stops all the junk, and allows fine-tuning to turn scripts on and off, all from an easy drop down menu.
-------------------------
access
This was working quite well up to about 12/1 - which seems to be when a new build was released. All of a sudden, Chrome started locking up periodically during the day. I tested internet connectivity with IE and FFOX at those times and they worked fine. Have disabled the extension and Chrome is now working fine.
I hope this is corrected as I think the extension is very good - quite like FFox noscript; it's a bit annoying to configure each site, but, worth it to me to have more security and control of what accesses my PC.

I can understand why people might rate this extension down, considering how much time a user must devote to manually filtering scripts, but I have to give it five stars, because I like the control I have in blocking scripts for various reasons. personally, it is the next best thing since NoScript that I still use with Firefox.

Thanks for your efforts, you've done an incredible job. Nothing is perfect, but you've come closer than any other script controller I've used, by a long shot! Occasionally have to turn off for a logins and need to keep an eye on the accumulating cruft/lists. BUT, IT WORKS! NOTE TO USERS: If you think it is too technical, use another extension, don't give a poor rating because of your own lack of knowledge, that's just selfish!

Works wonderfully.
I found that the correct way to use ScriptSafe and still allow other extensions to run is:
1. Go to the extensions settings page
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Copy the ID of the extensions you want to run
4. Whitelist that ID in ScriptSafe's options page

This is one of the best browser extensions I've ever used. I understand it can be frustrating for some people to have to take the time to figure out what scripts are needed to make pages run, but I feel so much safer browsing the internet with this, and I personally only see it as a minor inconvenience in my typical browsing. The only thing I have to say against it is that it hasn't been updated in a while, which is a real shame. In fact, I believe it can no longer be downloaded on Firefox as a result (and I didn't realize any of this until I suggested a friend download it and couldn't get a download link for him). The extension still works just fine despite the lack of updates, but I would be thrilled to see development continue on this extension.

Thank you for the fantastic browser extension! I'll keep holding out hope that you'll keep working on it again sometime!

The Decentraleyes extension is incredible.

Once installed, I notice that most websites load significantly quicker with no missing content, loading problems, or other trouble. Additionally, it is wonderful to know that I am cutting down on each website's ability to track me.

Unlike some content blockers I've used in the past, Decentraleyes does not require configuration before it can be used. There's no downloading or subscribing to lists. While the extension does let me whitelist specific websites, I have not found a website which needs to be whitelisted.

Finally, the developer of Decentraleyes, Thomas, is a great person. Not only has he provided a wealth of information about the extension within the Overview tab on the Chrome Web Store, he actively monitors issue reports and provides excellent support.

Every single thing about this extension is well built. I strongly recommend using Decentraleyes.

The "load pages more quickly" feature goes a quite a bit further than looking up DNS records. It pre-renders sites, and opens up TCP and SSL connections.

The best ad blocker. It blocks the most ads compared to other alternatives and has a clean design. Here are two options you might use as you surf the internet:
Right-click on the icon, and it brings up the option. You can stop it from working on particular sites by pressing "disable filtering on this website." In addition, if you notice an unblocked ad on a website click "Block ads on this website" and click on the ad that is showing up.

This is the best ad blocker I found for Facebook, blocks virtually all ads.
-------------------------

This is an impressive extension for Google Chrome - made by a few fellow developers.
It effectively blocks all obtrusive ads with no slowdowns whatsoever.
-------------------------
block
It's amazing. Works on all sites. Blocks all ads. (Video ads and image ads)
There's also a "Block element" tool in case you want to do that. 


My only complaint is that it doesn't work on Spotify anymore, but I can listen to YouTube Music ad-free, so whatever. 

This is definitely the best you can get with free ad-blockers.
-------------------------
block
Edit: As of March 28th, 2022, AdGuard is now blocking Spotify ads on my computer!! I'm so happy! Now I have no complaints.

Went through over dozens of ad blockers to find one that also blocks page redirects, new youtube anti-ad-block ads, and many other modern day anti-ad-blocking softwares on increasingly many websites. When this ad blocker did what I wanted and much more I was satisfied enough to come back to this page, look for the review area, and type a review (which I uncommonly do for extensions and apps) to explain and express my satisfactory.
-------------------------

Pretty amazing, block ads in Facebook and YouTube also!

THANK YOU FOR THIS APP. ITS VERY HELPFUL. IT HAS BLOCKED 4207 ADS IN 5 DAYS IN MY PC
-------------------------
block
It is one of the best adblockers I have ever used in my life.
I tried most of the adblockers but none was perfect in blocking ads. The Adguard is absolutely a lifesaver. It takes very less time to filter pages from ads, say, milliseconds. I tried it on most of the sites such as those which says to watch some ads to move to another page and keep on watching until 20 pages through this process; Adguard filters these sites and removes all the ads and saves my previous time. Yeah bro! Time is precious!!

It saves time!!!

Excellent extension for blocking ads on the Internet!

best adblocker in the world. highly customizable. it even blocks webRTC and the toolz of tyranny cant eavesdrop on you through the browser (find it in the stealthmode settings). truly sorry I can't thank AdGuard enough for the services they provide to the free men/women gratis...

Good ad blocker, also protect from phishing pages, for example if I type .com instead of .net, it'll warn me if it a phishing page.

love it. It works great and no problems. would highly recommend it to anyone...

Took care of the in-page video ads that pop-up blockers couldn't disable. This extension is wonderful. Also improved page performance/responsiveness by not allowing these in-page ads to render.

Nice, it makes my chrome experience better, thanks a lot.

The absolute best ad blocker for Chrome. I also use their paid product for Android. Extremely effective and feature packed.

Nice, it makes my chrome experience better, thanks a lot.

This is amazing. I use it on my smartphone for Chrome and on my laptop for Chrome. Blocks almost all ads. Easy to use, stylish in Settings. Very good, I use free 10 Mbps internet included to rent and pages are downloading so much faster now. I do not see what to buy next, not even in Gmail. This is so amazing, you all need it now. I've been installing AdBlockers to everyone in my family. AdGuard is one which worked the best. Big plus for working on Android as well. This company is the greatest. AdGuard saved me thousands not seeing the stuff they want to sell us all year long. Thank you so much, this is bargain for free.

I really like this Ad Blocker, It works Really well, Yet, For some reason it stopped blocking YouTube ads, I'll try reinstalling it, I'll see if that works. Other than that, It's a great ad blocker!!

Works pretty good, blocks most ads, even the obnoxious ones on youtube - it's just a shame it can't block them when i cast to my tv, occasionally uninstalls itself - but all in all, is still better than the last adblocker i used.
For folks complaining; Multi Billion dollar companies shouldn't need to force feed ads to us to make money and if you looked at how much money on youtube for example, is actually given to content creators, you'd understand why sites like onlyfans and patreon exist.

blocks ads pretty good

This adblocker is just the best! Totally like it! Delete all ads, and provide protection for a variety of things. It's not just another adblocker, it's a multi-purpose tool! Totally recommend 100% to add to chrome than the other adblockers because it is impressive!

I have been a user of Adguard for quite a long time and have also bought lifetime license for most of my devices (PC & Android). I do see a lot of difference with and without Adguard usage and definitely its a positive one with Adguard usage. I am not sure how much of user privacy is anonymous through Adguard but it definitely works a charm on the browsers am using. The good part of Adguard android app is that it also blocks ads on most of the other apps (Youtube is an exception).

Fantastic adblocker. I've been using it for the past 6 months. It has done such a great job, I don't even notice it until I use another computer and think to myself "Oh so that's what the page looks like for everyone else" noticing all the ads. The DNS servers are pretty nice too. They even block some mobile app banner ads.
-------------------------
block
Literally blocks every single ad in exitence. Incredibly useful, even blocks AUDIO advertisements and popups (the advertising ones). The "block ads on this webpage" button is also very useful, serving sort of as a website dissector to block intrusive parts. Statistics and user-fiendly graphs and settings round out this absolutely amazing extension.

Powerful and Spectacular Extension 
Thanks a lot Adguard
-------------------------
block
For me, AdGuard is the best ever when compared to (beggy dev) Adblock and (lazy dev) AdBlock Plus! And I find it to be much more convenient than the arguably-best uBlock Origin, because its filters properly allow certain things to work without headache-inducing investigation of what to unblock, e.g. Also it actually blocks things much better than the others on particular sites (such as adult).

AdGuard is now on-par with uBlock Origin too, finally supporting "strict blocking." And now that uBlock Origin isn't updated much anymore (well it's being severely delayed on the Chrome Store for whatever reasons), AdGuard is the new winner in my book.

One minor quirk with AdGuard is for some reason the extension occasionally crashes, requiring it to be manually reloaded or just restart Chrome.
-------------------------
block
@Sheetza: Well, I think the UI is cleaner and modern, and the presentation of the available filter lists is also easier to understand. But what I guess I mean by more convenient is I'm finding it actually blocks a lot better in many cases without the need to tweak much. Mileage will vary, of course, but so far I'm impressed with it in comparison.
-------------------------
detect
Great.Websites can not detect this AdBlocker...
-------------------------
protect
Amazing at adblocking, and protecting against virus websites.
-------------------------
block
My favorite thing about this adblocker is its 'inverse whitelist'. I am okay with ads that are not intrusive, annoying, or ones that significantly slow down page loading. The sites that do it 'right' I want to allow them to appear. The ones that do not, I want to block them. This inverse whitelist option allows me to do exactly that.
-------------------------
block
Best Ad-blocker for me. Blocks all the unwanted pop-ups and ads. saves my bandwith and time.
-------------------------
detect
it works! but some anti virus/spyware detect it as spyware. because of that i give 4 stars

prevent
AdGuard offers the best protection in its class. I have tested almost all Ad traffic prevention extensions on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Chromium Browser, FireFox Browser and by far Ad Guard is best in class. I have also tested in on Android Phone. It does make loading pages ad free easy and convenient. A lot of noise is reduced by Ad Guard in comparison to what things are without it.
Highly Recommend it for every device it is available.
-------------------------

Extremely useful extension. Blocks ads from almost every website and keeps the web browsing and youtube watching experience clutter free; highly recommended. Loved it!

Blocks every single ad on YouTube, makes it SOOOO much easier to watch videos! Thanks so much!!

protect
I have tried quite a few ad blockers in the past but this one is by far the best one you can get. 
I have never had any hassles with it nor has it been annoying to have unlike other ad blockers.
I'm quite surprised that it's even free to use, 
by the amount of options, filters and protections it offers.
p.s using Google Chrome.
-------------------------
block
Honestly the best extension i have ever used, I actually tested it at school since School computers have their firewall off and oh man Ad Guard blocked more than 1,000 privacy invasions. it was crazy to see more attacks on the computers than the number of ads that were blocked in a week!
-------------------------
block
It blocks "sponsors" url added in local ajax delete request. Works fine with other delete requests. Please see: https://ibb.co/FJ1jvyr
-------------------------
block
Best in blocking pop ups and ads <3 Keep it up.
-------------------------
block
Breaks Google AdWords settings page. No clue why but I was able to recreate the problem. I think the adblocker blocks some important js file that makes the accordions on the settings page.
-------------------------
protect
For many years I endured, an increasing barrage of "personalized" ads, that were very seldom relevant or timely.   Many ads evolved to become very intrusive and irritating  to me.   After some in depth research, I started my 14 day trial of AdGuard for Windows.   2 days later, on 7 Mar 2018, I confidently paid for my AdGuard for Windows, lifetime license for my desktop.   I was stoked!   It's now 2 Oct 2019, and I'm still stoked!   Yes, there are free AdGuard extensions for various browsers.   But AdGuard for Windows, (or for Mac or Android, or iOS), provides additional Internet tracking and privacy/stealth browsing protection, and it's the latest version available.   You can white list any site you wish.   Setup is not difficult.   AdGuard for Windows retains your settings.   Export to backup.   

Note: AdGuard is a powerful program.   On my other, default browser, I discovered that it must be uninstalled in order to install an extension on that browser.   Then its easily reinstalled from the Download Folder.   I'm still stoked!
-------------------------
block
I almost never write a review for software but after trying this I am very pleased that it really works!  I suggest that you play with the settings because until I changed them it wasn't blocking any ads.  To make testing easier, I opened a new tab with a web page full of ads. Every time I changed the settings, I would press F5 to reload the ad page and see if my changes did anything.  Highly recommended!!!!
-------------------------
block
Good standard application for blocking ads

nice and free and powerful add-on 
there is some site detective other adblock but adguard zero detective

Overall a good AD Blocker (does not block all ads but it didn't claim to either) the main thing that stands out to me is that unlike most ad blockers it prevents most - not all but nearly all sited from opening TABs on chrome or another window on your PC (like when you steam movies)

Blocks more ads than any other blocker I've ever used and never seems to be temperamental on some sites like others have in the past. Been using AdGuard for over a year now
-------------------------

for most basic blocks this works perfectly!
-------------------------
block
top tier ad block ..way better than adblock plus
-------------------------
block
So far it's working just fine for my environment. I specially like "whitelist" setting and it's straight-forward functionality and the "stealth" mode. Overall UI is very user-friendly. For some time I even wanted to switch to Brave browser because it has ad blocking as a default, but than I found this one so I'll stick to Chrome because of sync with all other stuff I'm using.
Thank you and keep the good work...
-------------------------
block
A fantastic security extension with an amazing and attractive UI! I've been using AdGuard for the past couple years now and it has done its job perfectly, but it's way more than just a simple ad blocker. It combines the features of extensions like AdBlock, Ghostery, the Avast extension, etc. into one and does each one of those things perfectly. You have lots of control over which filters you activate so you can have as much or as little protection as you want. Thanks to its great UI, even in the rare cases when the ad blocking breaks site features, you can quickly disable and then re-enable protection to get around the break.

In general, this is a must-have for browsing safely. The only issues I've EVER encountered since installing it are the occasional broken site but as I said, it's easy and quick to temporarily disable protection to get around that until the filters are updated. Heavyweight protection with lightweight performance.

Honestly, best free ad blocker I've ever had. However, recently it has stopped blocking some other ads but it's still reliable. Definitely recommend.

I first used this App over a website with tons of ads that makes me so sick of it, and by the way this website is csdn.net, a Chinese website with blogs related to computer programming topics. this App really is useful, it blocks all of the stupid ads for me, now I can concentrate on the real content of the website, now I'm satisfied, there are some other websites I haven't yet tested, so I rate it a 4 star!

It is very good extension as it saves data by blocking unwanted google ads and saves battery

It is amazing! It blocks all my unwanted ads and give me a pleasant experience. I absolutely recommend this app, it will make your life a lot easier.

Great user interface, powerful ad blocking capability, totally free, what can you expect more from an ad blocking extension, this extension rocks.

If you like the chrome extension try their phone app.The best part is that it blocks in-app ads!  It'll change how you relate to the internet on your phone.Its obsessively customizable and they're always adding new features. I've been using their products for several years and cant imagine going back.  I have the full program for windows as well, but the phone app is AMAZING. All of their products are one time fee--no subscriptions.

glad theres a block that works thank you adguard team

Amazing, blocks SO many ads, my life is saved.

I've tried tons of ad blocking extensions..since 2011, so I have a lot of experience with other blockers and AdGuard is vastly superior. I have been using it literally since I've found it. I even got it on my phone Lol. It truly is amazing. The GUI/Interface is clean and user-friendly. 10/10 Would recommend. ‚ô°

Ad blocking saves data and peace of mind too!

I've got the same issue. However, I'm using it on UC Browser and it worked PERFECT before the update. Now it's literally not blocking any ad.
-------------------------
block
Awesome. The new version 3.0 that has come out is so much better than the old one version 2. I love the green GUI showing how many things have been blocked and blocked now. It looks so much nicer than old version. Also easier to use in my opinion.
-------------------------
block
LOVED IT! Amazing! No other ad blocker can do better. With the new stealth mode, it blocks not only ads, but also trackers, hackers, and hides your search queries! Shocking performance, I would encourage anybody to install.
-------------------------

First time using it and it's great at blocking popups and ads.Thanks

Very Good Extension. Blocks all ads and helps me surf websites ad free. Cheers!

It is so so so good! Helps me block almost every ad. Thanks!

Best ad blocker out there! 100% reliable, unlike desktop apps that you may even need to pay for! This is entirely FREE! I've been using it for a year and I've been entirely ad-free. It also blocks pop-ups as a bonus! But it really slows down your browser when you start it, that part could use some work. But, overall, I LOVED IT!!!  =D

It is one of the best free ad blockers I've seen so far! I tried other ad blockers and they wanted me to pay to run their system! I love that it was free and that it actually works! I like that you can block elements even though they aren't ads and I like that you could block malware from getting into your computer! Thank you and keep up the good work!

It's great!   NOW NEAT AND CLEAN WEB PAGES
But some sites do not load due their ads being blocked.
-------------------------

Blocks ads just as well as any other ad blocker extension BUT this extension doesn't block reCAPTCHAs on sites where other adblockers have blocked the captchas, so I'm happy with AdGuard!
-------------------------
block
Consistent blocking, extension up-to-date with no unexpected behavior; excellent
-------------------------
block
I rate it a 4 1/5 out of 5. Personally, I love this adblocker, it does exactly everything you need it to, it blocks you from entering a dangerous website that could possibly harm your computer or harm your privacy. Filter updates do need manually updated, which I wish could be done automatically like it scans for updates every 8 hours on and it scans every time it's been turned on when it's been longer than 8 hours since it was last updated. That would make it a 5/5.
-------------------------
block
Since I've gotten, it hasn't failed once in blocking an advertisement, and it doesn't even slow down my browser that much, if at all.
-------------------------
block
it really works and blocks ads thank you very very very very very much!

It never blocks ads in search items.  first 4-5 results are ads

Sincerely, I have tried a lot of ad block extension, but they always miss something. This is an ad-killer. All I can say is that it is PERFECT! Thank you!

This is basically the best ad blocking technology on the market much better than ad black
-------------------------
bypass
I used to like this adblocker, but I switched to uBlock Origin (Nano, more specifically), which felt so effective that I never wanted to go back. If I'm honest, I have a huge feeling that Adguard, based on a quick check I did with it, has decided to whitelist companies (like AdBlockPlus).
Why am I only penalising one star? Because, despite that, the interface was nice. Good job for that.

Before September 19th, 2018:
It's good, but the only problem is that Adf.ly links aren't bypassed any more.
Other than that, it's simple, stylish and effective! Well done, Adguard!
(4 stars)

I just switched from AdBlocker. AdGuard AdBlocker is a package completer and it's free! This along side with Google Chrome's Protection and any Anti-Virus provides the ultimate protection!

I was using Ublock Origin but for some odd reason it started slowing down my chromebook. 

So I uninstalled this & turned on the optimized filters & my chromebook is fast again. I am going to use this from now on. It blocks everything that I want blocked so far & no slow downs. 

So please keep up the good work.

It blocks ads just as well as AdBlock, meaning that some dark websites still have ads that get through... But I love this more because some websites that tell me to disable my adblocker don't do that here. I sure as hell hope that this doesn't disappoint me.

I love this ad blocker, it's wonderful. With my old one, it was like a over cooked sandwich. Okay sometimes, but ultimately not ideal. This one even blocked phishing websites that I didn't know were phishing. Seriously, if you love not having ads, AND security, this adblocker is for you!

You guys are just amazing!!!
I love your awesome extension and android app. They both are transparent and really efficient.

good adguard adblocker for crome.
it also saves my data by blocking ads.when i installed it this expands my surfing time in limited internet packets.

I highly recommend it. I use it in combination with AdBlock, and in doing so make both more effective. AdGuard allows you to block ads on some sites that require AdBlock be turned off. Between them they cover the vast majority of ads.

This was working quite well until it started blocking embedded tweets and dropdown menus.

I have used ADblock Plus for the longest time and it made my browser and computer slow and freezy at some times. I was looking for something which doesn't take much resources and tried Ublock origin which it claimed to do. It was not very different from ADblock plus, i was giving up on ad blocks when i decided to give this a try and i am thankful for that. I finally got the ad block that i wanted which doesn't lag down my browser and computer and all the while doing its job perfectly. Thank you for this add-on and keep this add-on just like it is!!

Been using Adguard for years now. The best adblocker hands down.

I use it on every PC i put chrome on... and Firefox too...  Great way to block ads and malware.   I do wonder though,  what is the ACTUAL  "best" adblocker extension for chrome....  I would like to know, because i would probably use THAT one... 

but adguard is the best I know about right now.

Seemed to work fine, then I went to a wikia page and none of the ads were blocked.

Adguard is one of the most effective ad filter that I have tested. 

I just think that there should be an option to enable on page blocked object indicators to unblock elements by simply clicking on an indicator shown where the element would be located on page without ad filter.

Best ad blocking software I've come across! Didn't slow anything down and very easy to turn off and on.

Installed it in Vivaldi. Blocked EVERY BANNER/AD! right away (at default settings) on the 3 test websites I view most often. I liked Vivaldi but it showed every possible ad on webpages. Now Vivaldi is perfect thanks to Adguard AdBlocker! Page size is reduced by 15% on average, so pages are not only clean now but load faster. Previously, I thought Vivaldi is slow. It is fast without ads.

This extension is REALLY EXTENSIVE: it has every possible type of filter, including Spyware Filter, which excludes the need to install additional anti-tracking extensions.

Thank you so much, Adguard team!

This app is like a professional Ninja. It blocks pesky ads with skill and ease. Highly recommended. **UPDATE** 11/08/2016 There is no other ad blocker that I know of that does an absolutely excellent job of blocking ads from YouTube, Facebook and the rest. I have been using this ad blocker for several weeks now and have never had a problem on my Samsung Chromebook. If you want to be done with ads, GET ADGUARD ADBLOCKER!!!
-------------------------

The best Adblocker, much better than Adblock Plus, No pop ups, Bypasses adfly, blocks malware. Pretty much Adblock plus, but much better
-------------------------
block
So far I haven't had any issues and the blocking works well.  I will test memory vs ublock origin.  From what I can tell from usage (no testing) is that Adguard uses less memory.

I personally like to not block ads from certain sites that I use often and to allow good ads from Google since I find them well targeted to my interests and Adguard comes setup this way already.
-------------------------

It's now impacting more sites, making content flicker and move. Disabling it fixes everything, but allows annoying ads.

--Previous Review--

Recently, it's started to make sites like Amazon behave strangely. Disabling it fixes the problem.

--Previous Review--
Works really well, very precise control over what to block.

For some reason it doesn't work on bmwmotorcycles.com and I can't figure out why. When I say "Block Ads on this Website" it does nothing.

Other than that weirdness, it's a fantastic product.

Best AdBlock I've used. I come from Opera, where I've previously used this as it was recommended. I had to search specifically for this name in the chrome stored. It should definitely be more recommended.

This blocks Everything. Really, it shuts down every single ad in a page. It'll look weird at first, since the other common ones (AB+, etc) don't exactly do this. But it is awesome. Clean surfing.

Wonderful Block Extension Plugin. I just wish it didn't block most of my mainstream mediaplayback via chrome HTML5, js.flash and etc based webflash.
-------------------------
block
The best, #1 ad-blocker of "ad-blockers". Very efficient in blocking the most intrusive ads, smooth, light and low-key. It also blocks all the obtrusive video ads on video streaming sites like Youtube unlike AdBlocker.

You will not find a more effective ad-blocker than AdGuard. 

I recommend 100% to all.
-------------------------
block
I actually prefer this over all of the iterations of "AD Block/Ad Block Plus/etc.".

adblocker stops working after 2 weeks      and does not  block even youtube ads    but this is amazing works like charm
-------------------------

This is by far the best ad blocker I've used, and I've tried many of them. It not only blocks ads on normal websites, but also blocks YouTube ads, the elusive holy grail of ad blocking. It doesn't slow things down too much either. I just wish that they made an Android app.
-------------------------

A fantastic extension! I'm a Chinese user. Adguard can block sina, IThome... 's ad
-------------------------

Noticed an improvement in Chrome loading once I switched to Adblocker from ABP. I switched from ABP because it would not block on certain sites that I frequent (especially on a forum I like to use) so I gave AA a try and so far I like it
-------------------------
protect
This is a very good extension, i loved it cause it can protect me from annoying ads!
-------------------------

I give this a fat thumbs up because it blocks adware and most pop ups. It tells you what it blocks, and it's coding.
-------------------------
prevent
I'm happy to grant Adguard 5 stars. Now,if they could incorporate into it a way to prevent other apps or extensions from asking you to rate them once you have already rated them, I will find a way to give them 10. Anybody else think this might be a nice feature?

TIRE OF POPUP ADS? Then stop them NOW! With this program, Adguard AdBlocker, it WORKS & DOES THE JOB!

Now, I'm not getting junk & all these ads I don't want! In ONE DAY, this program blocked 91 ADS. If you're fed up with junk & want to stop it---this is the program to get:
ADGUARD ADBLOCKER

Download it, use it & you'll see a different in your favor! I've tried others programs but this is the only program I have rated 5 stars! It's that good.
-------------------------

Adguard is hands down, the most unabashed, unforgiving, absolutely relentless ad blocking beast ever known to man! In positive terms, I see no ads, and praise the good Lord for the historic work Adguard is doing. The absolute best. Don't use anything else.

protect
I've tried Adblock, AdBlock Plus, uBlock Origin, and then this.  So far AA seems to offer the best balance of protection and cosmetics.
-------------------------
block
Sadly doesn't block ads before they reach-you but rather after. Unlike ABP for instance. but at the same time is much faster, lighter, and unlike Ublock doesn't cause DNS errors and mess with connection settings, especially not without asking. 

4/5
If they ever upgrade it to somehow block-ads before they're downloaded (rather than after as it currently is) without the issues other browser based Adblockers have, will definitely change it to 5/5.
-------------------------
block
Best ads blocker out there! Blocks so many annoying and invasive ads, video ads, etc. Doesn't slow down browsing speed, a plus for Adguard. Can't browse the web without this tool these days. As for blocking ads, Adguard and Adblock Plus are on par. As for advanced features and extras, Adguard wins. Highly recommend Adguard over ABP.

Doesn't block ads on youtube.

I love this ad blocker! It seems much more effective then Adblock or Adblock Plus, and it gives the user much more control. If an ad gets through, I can easily flag it and it gets hidden immediately. I can also see a list of all the elements on the page including which ones are being blocked and why.

Highly recommended

doesnt block ads in youtube

It's simply the best adblocker out there. It can block any ads at blazing performance with a modern look.It can be an all in one adblocker/privacy/security protection piece of software for browsing the Net.
But, I am confused what filters I can add without a performace loss because there are too many filters. By the way, I am just a newbie that's why I don't really know about this matter.

Uses more RAM and CPU than uBlock but it's still way better than ABP and has a cleaner UI. The extra layer of privacy and malware blocking is a nice touch.

-------------------------

Have to give this extension a cautious 5 stars. Advice: you don't need the full version if you simply want to block ads, tracking, social media and malware effectively, so comments like 'wish this was free' are null and void. It is free, and I've tried the 'full version' to compare. There are some niggles but on balance this is more effective, and faster, than ABP or any other ad blocker I've tried in Chrome. I'm also now an 'ex-Ghostery user' - does what Ghostery does but blocks the ads as well. The UI is excellent as well. I'm no fan boy btw - I've tested them all and I'm simply sharing my current views
-------------------------
block
It's better than ABP in English Websites, but it almost do not block ads on Chinese Websites, otherwise it will be perfect. Please improve this issue.
-------------------------
block
I want the app to do two more things:

1) Update itself automatically, no need to manual update.

2) Option to block only video and audio ads. The banner-like and other ads are acceptable, since many websites I like rely on these banner ads for sustenance, I can accept viewing them. NOT THE VIDEO ADS NOR PANDORA ADS, those are evil. 

O, and the app works amazingly.
-------------------------
block
Over 3000 ads blocked in mere 3 days, with no disruption to browsing. Excellent, invisible app
-------------------------
block
Ran a side by side test with ABP, Ghostery, Adblocker & Adguard. Adguard consistently blocked more elements than the others. I didn't bother with a RAM usage test because my Macbook has had absolutely no issues. I think this one wins on my unscientific test. It gets my thumbs-up vote.
-------------------------
block
Wonderful!
Love that it blocks the YouTube ad at the top right.
-------------------------
block
it blocks both pop ups and ads and is better than adblock
-------------------------

Couple this with ABP then you got the ultimate blocking machine!

This is the best adblocker on the block IMO. The interface is nicer and more professional than any of the other adblockers for chrome, it seems to block ads just as well, and has lower resource usage than adblock plus.

The best anti-banner software I ever used.
Blocks all nonsense ads, offers child safety features, and prevents viruses and malware to entering the system.

Awesome to use adguard adblocker.

It's really a wise pick for professionals.
Blocks all wicked ads even if they are textual or audio-visual.
Speed is also great that makes it beat adblock plus.
Most of all, it's unique because of its parental control feature.

Amazing tool for blocking unnecessary adds and malicious attacks
-------------------------
block
Very simple to use. This extension is better suited for novices than other ad block extensions. The options feature a simple click switch style buttons that you can select for the level of ad blocking which includes malware, spyware & others. It blocks very well as it uses the blocking lists that are used by other ad blocking extensions such as Ad Block Plus

It does indeed use less memory than other ad blocking extensions as well.

You can also custom block elements or urls. Though the process may be different than you expect. You must click on the Ad Block button, then click on "Block Ad On This Website", from there you can hover your mouse above any element which highlights it, and can ad the block rule to your user filter list. Not the usual right click as you expect. A white list is included as well so you can make exceptions for ads you do want to see.

Overall it's a good ad blocking extension. It's simple to use, & light on memory compared to other comparable extensions.

Love this ad blocker! 
Better than ad block:
1. Fast
2. Low resource usage
3. Good design
4. More features, like malware blocking

The other side - upselling windows version. Could be disabled in settings.

no in your face popups.

seamlessly removes video ads from video streaming platforms (youtube, crunchyroll, etc).

love it. It works great and no problems. would highly recommend it to anyone...

Took care of the in-page video ads that pop-up blockers couldn't disable. This extension is wonderful. Also improved page performance/responsiveness by not allowing these in-page ads to render.

Nice, it makes my chrome experience better, thanks a lot.

The absolute best ad blocker for Chrome. I also use their paid product for Android. Extremely effective and feature packed.

Best ad blocker out there! 100% reliable, unlike desktop apps that you may even need to pay for! This is entirely FREE! I've been using it for a year and I've been entirely ad-free. It also blocks pop-ups as a bonus! But it really slows down your browser when you start it, that part could use some work. But, overall, I LOVED IT!!!  =D

Took care of the in-page video ads that pop-up blockers couldn't disable. This extension is wonderful. Also improved page performance/responsiveness by not allowing these in-page ads to render.

I have used many different adblocker but not enough benefited from those. Now i am using AdGuard AdBlocker few months and it's really good extension. The AdGuard AdBlocker is the very good ad-blocking extension cause it's not only block popup ads also block different ads. Whic let me help to reach correct files & read articles.
Thanks for this great Extension.

LOVE THIS EXTENSION!!  I deleted it by mistake (while cleaning up junk off my computer) and hold pop-up!!!!  You don't realize what an amazing job it does until it is removed.  My computer screen was filled with ads.  I quickly added Ad Guard Back and wa-la .... pop ups be gone.  AND what is so great too is, if you need to turn it off for a specific site it is so easy to do!  I love this extension - just love it.  NOBODY Loves all those intrusive pop-ups, and thanks to this extension I no longer have to see them!  I highly recommend this!

I LOVE this extension. Does not cause any problems with my computer EVER. Has blocked tons of ads and popus. I feel so much more secure. I even loaded it on  my friend's MAC. I don't think any program will block all popups and ads and this one is totally free. Thank you adguard guys (or girls)

Just added this app will evaluate further to change rating if it proves to be better than others like this that I have used...I think its okay but it does not block all ads or prevent popups as stated.... otherwise it is a cool app

Really useful, but I must say since I've been using Chrome I've never had so many popups. But Adgard helps me managing. Perhaps its me just getting used to what the best settings are on Adgard and my Mac.

Just wondering why I never installed it before today. Thanks a lot developers.

Fantastic, a free extension that makes using the internet a much better experience.I only wished it blocked MORE ads, like those pop-up banner ads on the top and bottom of pages.
-------------------------

Effective, but there should be a built-in filter that differentiates pop-ups for ads and pop-ups that are part of a legitimate website.

Lots of web designers have legit content load in a pop-up window.

Nonetheless, not a bad extension.

Extremely helpful ad blocking software.
Works very well with all websites and blocks everything unwanted like banner ads, pop-ups, ads, viruses, and malware attacks.

The best ad blocker. It blocks the most ads compared to other alternatives and has a clean design. Here are two options you might use as you surf the internet:
Right-click on the icon, and it brings up the option. You can stop it from working on particular sites by pressing "disable filtering on this website." In addition, if you notice an unblocked ad on a website click "Block ads on this website" and click on the ad that is showing up.
I would recommend it to all my friends.

Was a good adblocker. Youtube videos will no longer load with the adblock enabled. They work perfectly fine without it. RIP AdGuard
-------------------------
reload
For me, AdGuard is the best ever when compared to (beggy dev) Adblock and (lazy dev) AdBlock Plus! And I find it to be much more convenient than the arguably-best uBlock Origin, because its filters properly allow certain things to work without headache-inducing investigation of what to unblock, e.g. Also it actually blocks things much better than the others on particular sites (such as adult).

AdGuard is now on-par with uBlock Origin too, finally supporting "strict blocking." And now that uBlock Origin isn't updated much anymore (well it's being severely delayed on the Chrome Store for whatever reasons), AdGuard is the new winner in my book.

One minor quirk with AdGuard is for some reason the extension occasionally crashes, requiring it to be manually reloaded or just restart Chrome.
-------------------------
stop
best adblocker but doesnt stop anti adblock screens
-------------------------
stop
for some reason, my chrome will stop refreshing. I won't be able to open pages, close. But I still love my adguard
-------------------------
load
My favorite thing about this adblocker is its 'inverse whitelist'. I am okay with ads that are not intrusive, annoying, or ones that significantly slow down page loading. The sites that do it 'right' I want to allow them to appear. The ones that do not, I want to block them. This inverse whitelist option allows me to do exactly that.
-------------------------
load
This is probably the best ad blocker ever. The only problem is that sometimes it speeds up the loading on some websites, but also slows down some websites too. Nevertheless, it's a great ad blocker and I highly recommend it.
-------------------------
load
AdGuard offers the best protection in its class. I have tested almost all Ad traffic prevention extensions on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Chromium Browser, FireFox Browser and by far Ad Guard is best in class. I have also tested in on Android Phone. It does make loading pages ad free easy and convenient. A lot of noise is reduced by Ad Guard in comparison to what things are without it.
Highly Recommend it for every device it is available.
-------------------------
break
Breaks Google AdWords settings page. No clue why but I was able to recreate the problem. I think the adblocker blocks some important js file that makes the accordions on the settings page.
-------------------------
reload
I almost never write a review for software but after trying this I am very pleased that it really works!  I suggest that you play with the settings because until I changed them it wasn't blocking any ads.  To make testing easier, I opened a new tab with a web page full of ads. Every time I changed the settings, I would press F5 to reload the ad page and see if my changes did anything.  Highly recommended!!!!
-------------------------

Great ad blocker works all the time and has great design and it will warn me about certain pagfes and stop my information from going to third party sites

A fantastic security extension with an amazing and attractive UI! I've been using AdGuard for the past couple years now and it has done its job perfectly, but it's way more than just a simple ad blocker. It combines the features of extensions like AdBlock, Ghostery, the Avast extension, etc. into one and does each one of those things perfectly. You have lots of control over which filters you activate so you can have as much or as little protection as you want. Thanks to its great UI, even in the rare cases when the ad blocking breaks site features, you can quickly disable and then re-enable protection to get around the break.

In general, this is a must-have for browsing safely. The only issues I've EVER encountered since installing it are the occasional broken site but as I said, it's easy and quick to temporarily disable protection to get around that until the filters are updated. Heavyweight protection with lightweight performance.

I personally like this one best out of all the "other" commonly known one like adblock and adblock plus. Why?  Simple, it just has more features, but not as much as the adblock pro. However, its lightweight allow quicker load if you just need the minimal with enhanced security.

Websites have been revising their code - Drudge Report is only one, but the ads were impossible to stop with any other ad blocker. If you are running Adguard, you need to add this custom filter to your list:
drudgereport.com#%#Object.defineProperty(window,'adonisConnType',{get:function(){},set:function(){throw'Adguard: stopped a script execution.'}});

IT WORKS. Drudge is back to being ad-free, and life is good. Mama has a brand new ad blocker - Adguard!

Installed it in Vivaldi. Blocked EVERY BANNER/AD! right away (at default settings) on the 3 test websites I view most often. I liked Vivaldi but it showed every possible ad on webpages. Now Vivaldi is perfect thanks to Adguard AdBlocker! Page size is reduced by 15% on average, so pages are not only clean now but load faster. Previously, I thought Vivaldi is slow. It is fast without ads.

This extension is REALLY EXTENSIVE: it has every possible type of filter, including Spyware Filter, which excludes the need to install additional anti-tracking extensions.

Thank you so much, Adguard team!

Noticed an improvement in Chrome loading once I switched to Adblocker from ABP. I switched from ABP because it would not block on certain sites that I frequent (especially on a forum I like to use) so I gave AA a try and so far I like it
-------------------------

Generally works very well. Only complaint, and it may be a user failure (me), is that I had an issue with USAA--none of the content would load. I didn't suspect AdBlocker because this is a password access site with very strong security--once I'm in there I want to see what they present. USAA told me I had to whitelist USAA and all would be well--and it is, but now a few ads get through on other sites. It is still much better than not having it!

Sadly doesn't block ads before they reach-you but rather after. Unlike ABP for instance. but at the same time is much faster, lighter, and unlike Ublock doesn't cause DNS errors and mess with connection settings, especially not without asking.

Thank You adBlocker! I appreciate adBlocker, because it does "exactly" what it's name says...there are other sites that, when I go on them, I can tell right away that it is a site that is not monitored by Ad Blocker. And just as quickly as I logged on, I log right off. Where ever I browse, I make sure Ad Blocker is there too! And thats a fact!

Works VERY good. Almost TOO good..lol Many times I have had to manually disable it on sites because it's aggressive.  But that's a GOOD thing. Better to OVER-protect than UNDER-protect. 

Also, it seems to be just as good, (if not better even) than my other 3 installed Blockers. (Ublock Origin,Ublock Origin Extra, and Nano Adblocker)

By the way, if you're reading this, I HIGHLY recommend you add those 3 Blockers I mentioned above. They ALL play nice together with no "bumping heads".. üòú

i only give 4 stars because i have to manually update the filters even though its set to update automatically. still is better than the other adblockers.

I've been using Adguard since Dec. 2017. Other than telling me I've added my own "rule" to filter, I've had no issues with the app. I haven't deleted the rule because I was thinking it might have been from a software update? I probably should ask. (Gee, ya think?) I've told it to knock it off in the future but it just laughs at me. Other than the one act of self indulgence, it's a great app. Thank You.

manual
I rate it a 4 1/5 out of 5. Personally, I love this adblocker, it does exactly everything you need it to, it blocks you from entering a dangerous website that could possibly harm your computer or harm your privacy. Filter updates do need manually updated, which I wish could be done automatically like it scans for updates every 8 hours on and it scans every time it's been turned on when it's been longer than 8 hours since it was last updated. That would make it a 5/5.

I have found this ad-blocker very useful and it works great. I have also been saved a couple of times from sketchy links and such.

Best ad blocking software I've come across! Didn't slow anything down and very easy to turn off and on.

LOVE THIS EXTENSION!!  I deleted it by mistake (while cleaning up junk off my computer) and hold pop-up!!!!  You don't realize what an amazing job it does until it is removed.  My computer screen was filled with ads.  I quickly added Ad Guard Back and wa-la .... pop ups be gone.  AND what is so great too is, if you need to turn it off for a specific site it is so easy to do!  I love this extension - just love it.  NOBODY Loves all those intrusive pop-ups, and thanks to this extension I no longer have to see them!  I highly recommend this!

This adblocker is one of the best. I have downloaded as many adblockers as I could find and ran them individually (one at a time, no other adblockers). This adblocker worked far better than any others. I lets you set up individual rules and monitors the results. When the ads are able to violate the existing rules, it compares all recorded data, not just from your computer, but from all those who use adblocker. It will make a new filter based on the total information gathered from all other users. All filter rules created by adguard can be used, modified, or turned off by the user in order to give full control to the end users. Nice intelligent rules for either a shotgun approach or a sniper (very accurate and specific) approach. Exelent design, and full control by the user.

2) Option to block only video and audio ads. The banner-like and other ads are acceptable, since many websites I like rely on these banner ads for sustenance, I can accept viewing them. NOT THE VIDEO ADS NOR PANDORA ADS, those are evil. 

O, and the app works amazingly.

The best ad blocker. It blocks the most ads compared to other alternatives and has a clean design. Here are two options you might use as you surf the internet:
Right-click on the icon, and it brings up the option. You can stop it from working on particular sites by pressing "disable filtering on this website." In addition, if you notice an unblocked ad on a website click "Block ads on this website" and click on the ad that is showing up.
I would recommend it to all my friends.

It is one of the best adblockers I have ever used in my life.
I tried most of the adblockers but none was perfect in blocking ads. The Adguard is absolutely a lifesaver. It takes very less time to filter pages from ads, say, milliseconds. I tried it on most of the sites such as those which says to watch some ads to move to another page and keep on watching until 20 pages through this process; Adguard filters these sites and removes all the ads and saves my previous time. Yeah bro! Time is precious!!

It saves time!!!
-------------------------
filter
I've been using AdGuard (Desktop, Extension and Android app) for about 2 years and absolutely love it.  Those leaving poor reviews advising that it doesn't work are users that don't know how to configure and customize the filters properly and thus have a sub-par experience.

ITS Amazing really Recommend it!!! If you get you filters right the web is a new world!!

This AdBlocker is absolutely amazing in every single way. Youtube, news sites, illegal (videowatching) sites, the whole lot this adblocker blocks all the ads in them all. I've seen some reviews here about this ad blocker blocking too many ads that one may want to see however to that i will say simple press the toggle and turn it off or just whitelist that particular site. I honestly can't recommend this extension enough to everyone it is SO good. All I can say really is Well Done and Keep it Up adguard.com.üëèüèæüëèüèæ Doing some good stuff here, much appreciated.

For me, AdGuard is the best ever when compared to (beggy dev) Adblock and (lazy dev) AdBlock Plus! And I find it to be much more convenient than the arguably-best uBlock Origin, because its filters properly allow certain things to work without headache-inducing investigation of what to unblock, e.g. Also it actually blocks things much better than the others on particular sites (such as adult).

AdGuard is now on-par with uBlock Origin too, finally supporting "strict blocking." And now that uBlock Origin isn't updated much anymore (well it's being severely delayed on the Chrome Store for whatever reasons), AdGuard is the new winner in my book.

One minor quirk with AdGuard is for some reason the extension occasionally crashes, requiring it to be manually reloaded or just restart Chrome.
-------------------------
filter
@Sheetza: Well, I think the UI is cleaner and modern, and the presentation of the available filter lists is also easier to understand. But what I guess I mean by more convenient is I'm finding it actually blocks a lot better in many cases without the need to tweak much. Mileage will vary, of course, but so far I'm impressed with it in comparison.
-------------------------
whitelist
My favorite thing about this adblocker is its 'inverse whitelist'. I am okay with ads that are not intrusive, annoying, or ones that significantly slow down page loading. The sites that do it 'right' I want to allow them to appear. The ones that do not, I want to block them. This inverse whitelist option allows me to do exactly that.
-------------------------
filter
Best Adblocker around right now for Chrome. Quick and easy to sort through options and filter settings. Does not slow down a chromebook either.
-------------------------

I have tried quite a few ad blockers in the past but this one is by far the best one you can get. 
I have never had any hassles with it nor has it been annoying to have unlike other ad blockers.
I'm quite surprised that it's even free to use, 
by the amount of options, filters and protections it offers.
p.s using Google Chrome.

For many years I endured, an increasing barrage of "personalized" ads, that were very seldom relevant or timely.   Many ads evolved to become very intrusive and irritating  to me.   After some in depth research, I started my 14 day trial of AdGuard for Windows.   2 days later, on 7 Mar 2018, I confidently paid for my AdGuard for Windows, lifetime license for my desktop.   I was stoked!   It's now 2 Oct 2019, and I'm still stoked!   Yes, there are free AdGuard extensions for various browsers.   But AdGuard for Windows, (or for Mac or Android, or iOS), provides additional Internet tracking and privacy/stealth browsing protection, and it's the latest version available.   You can white list any site you wish.   Setup is not difficult.   AdGuard for Windows retains your settings.   Export to backup.   

Note: AdGuard is a powerful program.   On my other, default browser, I discovered that it must be uninstalled in order to install an extension on that browser.   Then its easily reinstalled from the Download Folder.   I'm still stoked!

A fantastic security extension with an amazing and attractive UI! I've been using AdGuard for the past couple years now and it has done its job perfectly, but it's way more than just a simple ad blocker. It combines the features of extensions like AdBlock, Ghostery, the Avast extension, etc. into one and does each one of those things perfectly. You have lots of control over which filters you activate so you can have as much or as little protection as you want. Thanks to its great UI, even in the rare cases when the ad blocking breaks site features, you can quickly disable and then re-enable protection to get around the break.

In general, this is a must-have for browsing safely. The only issues I've EVER encountered since installing it are the occasional broken site but as I said, it's easy and quick to temporarily disable protection to get around that until the filters are updated. Heavyweight protection with lightweight performance.

I used to like this adblocker, but I switched to uBlock Origin (Nano, more specifically), which felt so effective that I never wanted to go back. If I'm honest, I have a huge feeling that Adguard, based on a quick check I did with it, has decided to whitelist companies (like AdBlockPlus).
Why am I only penalising one star? Because, despite that, the interface was nice. Good job for that.

Before September 19th, 2018:
It's good, but the only problem is that Adf.ly links aren't bypassed any more.
Other than that, it's simple, stylish and effective! Well done, Adguard!

Websites have been revising their code - Drudge Report is only one, but the ads were impossible to stop with any other ad blocker. If you are running Adguard, you need to add this custom filter to your list:

IT WORKS. Drudge is back to being ad-free, and life is good. Mama has a brand new ad blocker - Adguard!

I tend to disregard and mark as unhelpful people who feel the need to attack others for their review. The updated version may be more helpful, and making sure windows and your browser are up to date may ease things up.

Adguard is one of the most effective ad filter that I have tested.

Installed it in Vivaldi. Blocked EVERY BANNER/AD! right away (at default settings) on the 3 test websites I view most often. I liked Vivaldi but it showed every possible ad on webpages. Now Vivaldi is perfect thanks to Adguard AdBlocker! Page size is reduced by 15% on average, so pages are not only clean now but load faster. Previously, I thought Vivaldi is slow. It is fast without ads.

This extension is REALLY EXTENSIVE: it has every possible type of filter, including Spyware Filter, which excludes the need to install additional anti-tracking extensions.

Thank you so much, Adguard team!

Generally works very well. Only complaint, and it may be a user failure (me), is that I had an issue with USAA--none of the content would load. I didn't suspect AdBlocker because this is a password access site with very strong security--once I'm in there I want to see what they present. USAA told me I had to whitelist USAA and all would be well--and it is, but now a few ads get through on other sites. It is still much better than not having it!

Best adblocker i've used on Chrome, have been using it for several months.

Effective, but there should be a built-in filter that differentiates pop-ups for ads and pop-ups that are part of a legitimate website.

Lots of web designers have legit content load in a pop-up window.

Nonetheless, not a bad extension.
-------------------------
filter
Very simple to use. This extension is better suited for novices than other ad block extensions. The options feature a simple click switch style buttons that you can select for the level of ad blocking which includes malware, spyware & others. It blocks very well as it uses the blocking lists that are used by other ad blocking extensions such as Ad Block Plus

It does indeed use less memory than other ad blocking extensions as well.

You can also custom block elements or urls. Though the process may be different than you expect. You must click on the Ad Block button, then click on "Block Ad On This Website", from there you can hover your mouse above any element which highlights it, and can ad the block rule to your user filter list. Not the usual right click as you expect. A white list is included as well so you can make exceptions for ads you do want to see.

Overall it's a good ad blocking extension. It's simple to use, & light on memory compared to other comparable extensions.

Now Vivaldi is perfect thanks to Adguard AdBlocker! Page size is reduced by 15% on average, so pages are not only clean now but load faster. Previously, I thought Vivaldi is slow. It is fast without ads.

This extension is REALLY EXTENSIVE: it has every possible type of filter, including Spyware Filter, which excludes the need to install additional anti-tracking extensions.

Thank you so much, Adguard team!

an effective ad blocker with a simple UI for config. 5 stars!

Seems good overall. A couple of issues though. The "allow acceptable ads" is turned ON by default (with no notification), without explaining what that would include.   Also, would be nice to be able to allow certain sites to use social tracking (like facebook) but not the rest of ads. 

Overall, fairly light, easy to use, gets the job done.

This app is so effective that I am litterally spoiled by it! I never have to be bothered by invading sales pushers and other shove-it-down-my-throat-and-haul-it-out-of-my-wallet websites, programs and other webwhores! omg, I think I just created a new word...webwhores! Gotta go as I am lmao and might pee myself at my age! Thank you so much for this program! Lovin' it Lots! Myrtle in Maine ;-)

I've had no problems at all. I installed it on the Chrome browser, and Opera. I was using another adblocker that was working great up until a week ago. Installed another one that did absolutely nothing - then I installed this one. Not even the 'skip ad' button with a blank screen (which I got with the other one that I'd been using for a couple of years): straight to the video with no delays or drop-outs. Great extension.

I have been a user of Adguard for quite a long time and have also bought lifetime license for most of my devices (PC & Android). I do see a lot of difference with and without Adguard usage and definitely its a positive one with Adguard usage. I am not sure how much of user privacy is anonymous through Adguard but it definitely works a charm on the browsers am using. The good part of Adguard android app is that it also blocks ads on most of the other apps (Youtube is an exception).

AdGuard offers the best protection in its class. I have tested almost all Ad traffic prevention extensions on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Chromium Browser, FireFox Browser and by far Ad Guard is best in class. I have also tested in on Android Phone. It does make loading pages ad free easy and convenient. A lot of noise is reduced by Ad Guard in comparison to what things are without it.
Highly Recommend it for every device it is available.
-------------------------

For many years I endured, an increasing barrage of "personalized" ads, that were very seldom relevant or timely.   Many ads evolved to become very intrusive and irritating  to me.   After some in depth research, I started my 14 day trial of AdGuard for Windows.   2 days later, on 7 Mar 2018, I confidently paid for my AdGuard for Windows, lifetime license for my desktop.   I was stoked!   It's now 2 Oct 2019, and I'm still stoked!   Yes, there are free AdGuard extensions for various browsers.   But AdGuard for Windows, (or for Mac or Android, or iOS), provides additional Internet tracking and privacy/stealth browsing protection, and it's the latest version available.   You can white list any site you wish.   Setup is not difficult.   AdGuard for Windows retains your settings.   Export to backup.   

Note: AdGuard is a powerful program.   On my other, default browser, I discovered that it must be uninstalled in order to install an extension on that browser.   Then its easily reinstalled from the Download Folder.   I'm still stoked!
-------------------------
browser
So far it's working just fine for my environment. I specially like "whitelist" setting and it's straight-forward functionality and the "stealth" mode. Overall UI is very user-friendly. For some time I even wanted to switch to Brave browser because it has ad blocking as a default, but than I found this one so I'll stick to Chrome because of sync with all other stuff I'm using.
Thank you and keep the good work...
-------------------------

Decent product {given the price on the entry-level version}.  
Highly modifiable, and responsive.

+Add this EARLY!  If for NO other reason than, it won't get hidden amongst the other Browser Add-In's.  This way you can easily "Whitelist" or "Blacklist" pages and save some time.

Best ad blocker out there! 100% reliable, unlike desktop apps that you may even need to pay for! This is entirely FREE! I've been using it for a year and I've been entirely ad-free.

Wow.

I've been using AdBlockPlus for years. Tried AdGuard. What a difference.

FYI - the browser extension is full featured and FREE. You only pay for the full desktop and mobile versions. That being said, I loved the extension so much, I purchased a year for Android and Windows/Mac devices. What a great product. Keep it up guys!

works fantastic with my Windows 7 and Chrome Browser . I'm sure for some will find that it my not work. I gave AdGuard AdBlocker a try and it works the best for me.I also run Adblock for YouTube and find these two work great together.Thanks AdGuard and Adblocker for YouTube!

I have used ADblock Plus for the longest time and it made my browser and computer slow and freezy at some times. I was looking for something which doesn't take much resources and tried Ublock origin which it claimed to do. It was not very different from ADblock plus, i was giving up on ad blocks when i decided to give this a try and i am thankful for that. I finally got the ad block that i wanted which doesn't lag down my browser and computer and all the while doing its job perfectly. Thank you for this add-on and keep this add-on just like it is!!

I experimented with Slimjet's

My first mention of Adguard in my review I am referring to the Adguard  Chrome extension which is for the 1 browser.  The desktop works across all browsers with no need for a plugin.

When i close the chrome and when i open it again. the Adguard says "This extension may have been corrupted." and I need to reinstall again. It always happen everytime when I close the Chrome browser. Pleas fix this issue i really love your extension and I will give 5  star rate when you fix this guys. PLEASE FIX IT. :(

I tend to disregard and mark as unhelpful people who feel the need to attack others for their review. The updated version may be more helpful, and making sure windows and your browser are up to date may ease things up. I found my Norton Identity Safe arguing with this extension for a bit, but after the update and a whitelist I was fine. Had to reinstall and was pleased to see this newer version available.

Definitely a favorite, I have been using it for almost a year now and I am very pleased with the results. I Would Highly Recommend this for the average user of Chrome or any other compatible browser.

-------------------------
browser
Sadly doesn't block ads before they reach-you but rather after. Unlike ABP for instance. but at the same time is much faster, lighter, and unlike Ublock doesn't cause DNS errors and mess with connection settings, especially not without asking. 

4/5
If they ever upgrade it to somehow block-ads before they're downloaded (rather than after as it currently is) without the issues other browser based Adblockers have, will definitely change it to 5/5.
-------------------------

I love it.  It makes my browsing a very pleasant experience.  On my Google Chrome browser, it works perfectly and does SO much to protect. I feel much more secure now when I browse and I love the option of having a toolbar icon. Thanks Adguard!

I have used all adguard products for years. Getting the Adguard lifetime license for ones android phone should be required. Everyone I've introduced to it loves it. No ads on the internet with phishing and malware protection while saving data. Its a no brainer.
-------------------------
data
This adblocker is one of the best. I have downloaded as many adblockers as I could find and ran them individually (one at a time, no other adblockers). This adblocker worked far better than any others. I lets you set up individual rules and monitors the results. When the ads are able to violate the existing rules, it compares all recorded data, not just from your computer, but from all those who use adblocker. It will make a new filter based on the total information gathered from all other users. All filter rules created by adguard can be used, modified, or turned off by the user in order to give full control to the end users. Nice intelligent rules for either a shotgun approach or a sniper (very accurate and specific) approach. Exelent design, and full control by the user.

My favorite thing about this adblocker is its 'inverse whitelist'. I am okay with ads that are not intrusive, annoying, or ones that significantly slow down page loading. The sites that do it 'right' I want to allow them to appear. The ones that do not, I want to block them. This inverse whitelist option allows me to do exactly that.

Superb AdBlocker. It eliminated the extremely annoying ads on Yahoo Mail which often competed with my mouse and computer for attention slowing it down by lots. Annoying indeed, i'd say. Tried other blockers but removed them as fast as i installed them. Didn't work as desired. AdBlocker does so indeed and does it silently without slowing down my already old and slowish laptop. Recommended indeed!!!

I've tried several adblockers, and I've found that Adguard is the best all-around adblocker. I had trouble with other adblockers consuming lot's of memory or seemingly slowing down Chrome, especially when I have lots of tabs open.

Awesomely light and does its work better than ABP Plus what so ever. I really support the developers

Works good and very fast, should of be using this extension a long time ago.

Clearly better than Adblock(Plus) and etc. because it's more than adblocker, it is also an online browsing security.

I don't recommend full version to slow or below 4Gb RAM computers, it will consume high resource.

one of the best web protection. I like this coz it is simple, all feastures are very useful and very light.

The best anti-banner software I ever used.
Blocks all nonsense ads, offers child safety features, and prevents viruses and malware to entering the system.
I am glad that it doeesn't slow down my system neither it uses extra system resources.
Indeed, it's a great addition to cutting edge technology!
-------------------------

It's an excellent app that offers everything for free.
Although, it does slow down the system a bit when once you start it, but once it starts running, it gets the system back to normal life.
I love it for its efficiency, reliability and easy-to-use features.
Awesome app it is!
-------------------------
speed
It's really a wise pick for professionals.
Blocks all wicked ads even if they are textual or audio-visual.
Speed is also great that makes it beat adblock plus.
Most of all, it's unique because of its parental control feature.
It impressed me!

Very simple to use. This extension is better suited for novices than other ad block extensions. The options feature a simple click switch style buttons that you can select for the level of ad blocking which includes malware, spyware & others. It blocks very well as it uses the blocking lists that are used by other ad blocking extensions such as Ad Block Plus

It does indeed use less memory than other ad blocking extensions as well.

You can also custom block elements or urls. Though the process may be different than you expect. You must click on the Ad Block button, then click on "Block Ad On This Website", from there you can hover your mouse above any element which highlights it, and can ad the block rule to your user filter list. Not the usual right click as you expect. A white list is included as well so you can make exceptions for ads you do want to see.

Overall it's a good ad blocking extension. It's simple to use, & light on memory compared to other comparable extensions.
-------------------------
light
Real time protection from spamming websites, viruses, malware and many other threats!
The impressive thing is, it's more efficient and light than other adblockers like adblock plus.
I love it when I am working and I don't get distracted. It's all because of this amazing app!
-------------------------
light
My choice to kick-off youtube, facebook, google and other unwanted ads.
Best performance adblocker I found so far.
It really beats the rubbish (Adblock plus).
Really, it's worth-praising for its efficiency,accurate details and lightness.
Great add-on indeed!
-------------------------

Seems good overall. A couple of issues though. The "allow acceptable ads" is turned ON by default (with no notification), without explaining what that would include.   Also, would be nice to be able to allow certain sites to use social tracking (like facebook) but not the rest of ads. 

Overall, fairly light, easy to use, gets the job done.
-------------------------
cpu
State-of-the-art application developed - I must profess.
Using it for the past 3 months and never had any complaint about it.
Works fine and never uses CPU too much and never distracted my attention.
Compared to the ABP extension, it's worth-praising.
It blocks all the unwanted ads, banners, trackers and everything that can be threatening to my online experience.
Highly-appreciable!
-------------------------
fast
Love this ad blocker! 
Better than ad block:
1. Fast
2. Low resource usage
3. Good design
4. More features, like malware blocking

The other side - upselling windows version. Could be disabled in settings.
-------------------------
slow
So far, it's great. Also, doesn't slow down Chrome as some adblock extensions are doing with the new Chrome 34.x

Great overall. Autofill could be improved some because occasionally I need to manually select fill UN and PW from a Bitwarden drop-down list. But for a free app, it's not that big of a deal. It does store unlimited user names and passwords and any notes you may have about websites. I've been using Bitwarden for years and it is a solid app (not buggy at all). I certainly wouldn't use a paid password manager, when Bitwarden does a great job. 

I see where some users are annoyed with having to use their master password often. If you want to prevent this: 

Open Bitwarden settings.

Select "Vault Timeout" and choose when your vault will lock. 

Select "Vault Timeout Action" and select "lock". If you select "logout" you may need to log back in with your master password the next time you use Bitwarden.

Select "Unlock with PIN". A popup will appear for you to enter your PIN. On this popup you can also deselect "Lock with master password on browser restart" if you like. If someone enters the wrong PIN five times in a row, Bitwarden will then require that you use your master password.

If your going to be away from your computer and want to secure your passwords, you can manually lock Bitwarden in the settings, or you can let Bitwarden lock automatically based on the timeout settings you choose. Once locked you will need to use your Bitwarden master password to access the app. These instructions are specifically for Windows 10. You should have no problems using them for Android too.

best free password manager, worth trusting and for those who want state of art encryption and secure autofill, those kind of people are in luck plus its open source, now how cool is that you are getting a opensource fully protected password manager for "FREE"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

block
Migrated from LastPass. Their premium does not warrant the cost. Importing my data was super easy, interface is slick and quicker than what I am accustomed to. LP extension had a terrible interface that blocked most of the login list with buttons to other features (like vault etc). BitLocker has these options under another tab. Much better UI choice. Loving what I've seen so far. Inclined to support for the price of premium too!
-------------------------
protect
Coming over from Last Pass like it but have a question.  When I'm working on my computer I have to log back in to Bitwarden for every password protected site I open.  I don't want to have to log  back into Bitwarden for every password protected page I open when I'm using multiple password protected sites at once, all within a few minutes of one another.  With Last Pass, I could log in and it would keep me logged in for a specified time period and any password protected site I opened within that time period would auto fill and open.  Don't see a way to do the same thing at BW.  Other than that, it's great.
-------------------------
detect
I migrated from NordPass and I do not regret of my decision! Bitwarden is amazing, fre, opensource, user friendly and secure!!!

This extension works like a charm, recognizes every single login field, works in new tabs, detect new logins and password changes.
-------------------------
detect
Love this extension and app overall, the fact that you can sync it with your phone and use the password manager there with any app is extremely useful.

The UI is intuitive and easy to work with, has some extra goodie features like adding notes and multiple paths to detect the password usage, and best of all it is open source.
-------------------------
protect
Very intuitive and the best password manager by far I've used so far. Very easy to set up and import all your passwords to. Highly recommend for security reasons to get this password manager and get the premium. $10 per year? That's the price of a coffee here in NYC. So 10 bucks per year for a piece of mind and knowing that all my accounts are secure is a very small price to pay. I could not say enough good things about bitwarden. I know this is just the extension review but it doesn't matter. It's open source so you can check the code and add to it if you want. I love that as well. All the passwords get encrypted when you store them in the cloud so there's no way of security breach even if they decided to go evil (which I seriously doubt) but even then all your data is encrypted and protected. Absolutely a must have in today's world. ****DISCLAIMER*** I am not getting paid nor am i affiliated with bitwarden in anyway. This is 100% true review from a customer perspective. Thank you Bitwarden for the piece of mind and freedom to know that all my accounts are safe and secure.

I migrated from LastPass after they announced their changes to the free version's ToS. I have to say I wish I would've found Bitwarden first. It was simple to set up in Chrome on my PC and works perfectly. I like the UI much better than LastPass, especially since I can manage everything from the extension's popup vs. LastPass having to open new tabs for everything. The password generator function seems to work better as well. I always seemed to have issues with LastPass and my mouse's sensitivity not allowing me to select the number of characters I wanted to use. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an easy-to-use, free password manager.

I wanted to switch from lastpass, 'cause I hate it. it is slow and stupid. 
At first, this extension looked promising, but after I tried to login into booking.com user area, I now think, that bitwarden developers have a lot to do. Auto fill did not work in a popup window. Also, by default, it collects analytics, i.e. downloads a javascript from google.com, which is I think could be a playground for a MITM (Man-in-the-middle) attack, or basically , this function must be off by default or removed completely.
I like the user interface though. Simple and functional. Keep up the good work.

I got this extension after listening to my favorite Linux Podcast "Destination Linux". They were being continuously sponsored by Bit Warden. They were really loving how fast and secure this app is and I agree. It helps me feel like I am finally taking back control of my password management without going broke.
-------------------------

I'll be honest, Bitwarden is the first password manager I've used (a friend recommended) I was a bit skeptical at first. But I'm really glad I gave it a try, it's changed how easily I can access things. Like those random rewards apps, I'd always forget the password and just not bother. Now I can use things easily without having to re-use passwords or compromise my security by using weak rememberable passwords. I know there are other Password managers out there, but I can't really imagine how they could improve what Bitwarden already does.
-------------------------

The best password manager! The chrome extension works so well and it is really easy to use. One click on the page and your login details are filled out or it automatically logs in via Face ID. Organises all my information so I can access it easily. Security wise, the app has many options such as 2 factor authentication or tells you when someone logs in from another browser. Unbelievable that this is for free!

Made the switch when Lastpass forced for users to pay for multi-device access. No regrets. I bought Bitwardens premium plan which comes out to about $1.20 a month. The plan also includes 1Gb of secure stoarge to store secure notes for instance, temporary passwords. You would think with the best featureset on the market, the lowest cost to use, that is what makes this the best choice. It gets better, the software is also opensource. So, anyone who understands programming can check it out to make sure its secure and test it out against attacks to keep it secure. You can find Bitwardens audits online or by emailing them and asking for their most recent audit.

The absolute BEST password manager availble, to date. The extension/add-on versions work in all my browsers (Brave, Firefox, Edge) and the installed version works fine (if you need it). No longer do I need to trust the browser to save my passwords, and I can access my pws from anywhere. THANK YOU.

Goodbye greedy Lastpass! Bitwarden is fantastic and the emergency access option alone is worth the Premium upgrade for a very modest and fair $10/year. One of the best apps

I was a user of Dashlane Premium but moved when the company removed our free access.  This is just as good the only difference is that Dashlane will also auto-logon to websites but to be honest this can be a bit annoying so auto-fill and one click works for me.  Export from Dashlane and import to Bitwarden worked perfectly.  NB: It's not obvious how to set up auto-fill but it works well once done.
-------------------------

For everyone thinking there is no autofill: You can either autofill a site with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+L or enable autofill when loading a site in the options. So yes, Bitwarden has autofill. And it is the best password manager I've used so far.
-------------------------
access
The best password manager I have used! Really phenomenal.
Being a developer myself, the features I liked:
- Clean & easy to understand UI/UX
- Auto-fill for website
- Ability to change the URL matching mechanism for specific credentials, instead of global setting
- PIN access for people who don't want to type the Master Password every time they open the extension
- Ability to choose when the extension should lock the vault
- Well-designed Password generator embedded into the extension
- Ability to import passwords from other famous password managers (especially, LastPass :P)
- Verify if the passwords were exposed in any of the known leaks
- Ability to store Secure Notes and credit card details
- Awesome support for Android and other devices
Last, but not the least, it is an Open-Source project!

Kudos to the developers working on BitWarden and thanks for such a product.

Equally as good or better than LastPass plus Free on all platforms. IF you refuse to read the instructions or google for help, it might take some trail and error to get Bitwarden working properly in all browsers and applications on all platforms. But, it does work everywhere! There is no sacrifice of features or service at the reduced price of FREE!

+ Same functions as other cloud password managers, but open source. 
+ The migration from LastPass to BitWarden took less than five minutes.
+ Never overtly bugs you about buying premium memberships or access to paid features.
+ Aesthetically pleasing, bloat-free interface.
Verdict: head and shoulders above the competition. Offline password managers are more secure, but among cloud-based managers this is the absolute best.

Conversion from LastPass was very easy with the simple instructions provided. It seems to work quicker and have fewer hiccups with "autofill when page is loaded." I echo the sentiments of Guru H "what i miss is, when multiple account of a same service has to be logged in, i cant switch  within username box itself. have to click icon on top." Also really like that I can use iris scan to unlock on Android. Thank you.

Yep, just migrated from LastPass and literally took 30 seconds to transfer all my passwords! Absolutely loving Bitwarden right now. Too bad LastPass is removing the "access on multiple types of devices" option, so, bye bye, you have served well. What's the use of a password manager if it stops working on a different platform of device?
-------------------------
access
Coming from LastPass, I am very happy with Bitwarden so far.  Some things I like: Cleaner looking UI, the ability to define multiple URLs, configurable URL matching, ability to self-host, easy export/import process for migrating, access to both mobile and desktop on the free plan.  Once I get comfortable and move the rest of my family, I plan to sign up for the annual family plan.

I was a LastPass user for a long time. I really liked it but all that time I couldn't filly have peace in mind because after all I had no idea who might have access to my data. I was trying out different open-source self-hosted alternatives but all of them lacked important features such as mobile app integrations or buggy autofill. 
But when I found out about Bitwarden it finally solved my problem. I easily imported all my LastPass data into Bitwarden. The user experience is also much better than LastPass and I have self-hosted the solution on the cloud, employing high security measures such as database encryption, disc encryption, encryption in-transit, key rotation and ip-address filtering. Finally I can sleep well!
I am even considering subscribing to a premium plan even though I don't really need it but I want to show my support for the developers. They really solved a big trouble for me.
-------------------------
bug
I was a LastPass user and couldn't take their bugs anymore. My notes and URLs would periodically and randomly get garbled and replaced with random characters or would replace entire lines or paragraphs of notes in my passwords with the character: ‚ñØ. 

BitWarden is really good. A lot better than I expected. And it even has features that no other services I've seen have like Dark Mode. I just wish I was able to share passwords with friends.
-------------------------
bug
I hated LastPass so deeply. I've been using Bitwarden for almost a year now, and, while there are some parts which could make my life more comfortable, it's just light years better than LastPass. Had a friend who worked on LastPass, he said their code was so tangled, it was practically impossible to fix bugs or add new features. No wonder that there's such a great difference. Thanks, Bitwarden guys!

Awesome password manager! The best one that I have tried so far and trust me I have tried a boat load of them! I love the Android app too! I just wish the Android App had one option that is missing. 

Can you have the big letter of the alphabet pop up on the right hand side when we are scrolling up or down in our login list?

You know how the "Contacts" app in Android 10 will pop up different letters of the alphabet on the right hand side when we are scrolling through our contacts? That is what I want in the android app for Bitwarden! I have a huge list of logins and if I could swipe up or down and get the big letter of the alphabet to pop up on the right hand side like it does in the contacts app that would surely speed up which login item I am trying to scroll to. Mine list is really long and it would speed me up in a quick hurry if I could select the alphabet letter on the right to go to the "T" section. Does this make sense? If not email me and I will send u a screenshot of what I am talking about.

Thanks a ton for this great app (and it still even works on Windows 7! Awesome!)

Switched from lastpass, so great. 

Let me start off by saying that I used lastpass before, but ever since the update that you could only have one device at a time, I found myself using lastpass for pc and icloud keychain for chrome, but with bitwarden, you can use both iOS/Android and Windows/Mac at the same time. It's great.

Just one thing I would be really happy with - seems that LastPass and the Chrome default password managers are much more alert to signups I do, and suggest saving the password.

It works, just works, and it's quicker than Lastpass. It was so fast that I ended up cleaning up my passwords, a task I'd been putting off in Lastpass.  It will do analysis as well - reused passwords, hacked accounts etc.  And has options Lastpass doesn't - you can stand up your own server if you like.

Love the Android app as well - quick/clean.  I've abandoned Lastpass.

As a side note: I had a small issue when I exported my Lastpass to a CSV. It wouldn't import into Bitwarden.  I emailed support, and BAM I had a response very quickly, they solved my issue.  Later when I had another problem BAM they responded again very quickly.  I'm not used to this level of service.  It was just one more (very important) thing that caused me to convert. 

I'd highly recommend Bitwarden.

I was so happy I upgraded to Premium to support them.  Even though I didn't have to, and I have almost a year left on my Lastpass subscription.

For what it is, it is amazing. A little manual setup on the front of the experience, and enabling the pin for unlocking your vault is recommended, generally though this extension and the service that it is tied to work flawlessly.

I wanted to switch from lastpass, 'cause I hate it. it is slow and stupid. 
At first, this extension looked promising, but after I tried to login into booking.com user area, I now think, that bitwarden developers have a lot to do. Auto fill did not work in a popup window. Also, by default, it collects analytics, i.e. downloads a javascript from google.com, which is I think could be a playground for a MITM (Man-in-the-middle) attack, or basically , this function must be off by default or removed completely.
I like the user interface though. Simple and functional. Keep up the good work.

Thanks for the support and feedback! For #1, vault filters have recently been introduced https://bitwarden.com/help/managing-items/#filter-by-vault or let me know if you're looking for something else. #2 If using Firefox or Opera, you can use the browser sidebar functionality (or pop out using icon in top left on other browser extensions) to create a persistent experience. #3 Thanks for reporting this one! Rest assured your feedback has been passed along to the team, thanks!

Great overall. Autofill could be improved some because occasionally I need to manually select fill UN and PW from a Bitwarden drop-down list. But for a free app, it's not that big of a deal. It does store unlimited user names and passwords and any notes you may have about websites. I've been using Bitwarden for years and it is a solid app (not buggy at all). I certainly wouldn't use a paid password manager, when Bitwarden does a great job. 

I see where some users are annoyed with having to use their master password often. If you want to prevent this: 

Open Bitwarden settings.

Select "Vault Timeout" and choose when your vault will lock. 

Select "Vault Timeout Action" and select "lock". If you select "logout" you may need to log back in with your master password the next time you use Bitwarden.

Select "Unlock with PIN". A popup will appear for you to enter your PIN. On this popup you can also deselect "Lock with master password on browser restart" if you like. If someone enters the wrong PIN five times in a row, Bitwarden will then require that you use your master password.

If your going to be away from your computer and want to secure your passwords, you can manually lock Bitwarden in the settings, or you can let Bitwarden lock automatically based on the timeout settings you choose. Once locked you will need to use your Bitwarden master password to access the app. These instructions are specifically for Windows 10. You should have no problems using them for Android too.

Migrated from LastPass. Their premium does not warrant the cost. Importing my data was super easy, interface is slick and quicker than what I am accustomed to. LP extension had a terrible interface that blocked most of the login list with buttons to other features (like vault etc). BitLocker has these options under another tab. Much better UI choice. Loving what I've seen so far. Inclined to support for the price of premium too!
-------------------------

I was a LastPass user for a long time. I really liked it but all that time I couldn't filly have peace in mind because after all I had no idea who might have access to my data. I was trying out different open-source self-hosted alternatives but all of them lacked important features such as mobile app integrations or buggy autofill. 
But when I found out about Bitwarden it finally solved my problem. I easily imported all my LastPass data into Bitwarden. The user experience is also much better than LastPass and I have self-hosted the solution on the cloud, employing high security measures such as database encryption, disc encryption, encryption in-transit, key rotation and ip-address filtering. Finally I can sleep well!
I am even considering subscribing to a premium plan even though I don't really need it but I want to show my support for the developers. They really solved a big trouble for me.

Awesome password manager! The best one that I have tried so far and trust me I have tried a boat load of them! I love the Android app too! I just wish the Android App had one option that is missing. 

Can you have the big letter of the alphabet pop up on the right hand side when we are scrolling up or down in our login list?

You know how the "Contacts" app in Android 10 will pop up different letters of the alphabet on the right hand side when we are scrolling through our contacts? That is what I want in the android app for Bitwarden! I have a huge list of logins and if I could swipe up or down and get the big letter of the alphabet to pop up on the right hand side like it does in the contacts app that would surely speed up which login item I am trying to scroll to. Mine list is really long and it would speed me up in a quick hurry if I could select the alphabet letter on the right to go to the "T" section. Does this make sense? If not email me and I will send u a screenshot of what I am talking about.

Thanks a ton for this great app (and it still even works on Windows 7! Awesome!)

I have been a long time Lastpass user and though I only just installed and started using Bitwarden, I can see it shows great value and promise. I started looking for a Lastpass alternate due to the fast increase in price. Lastpass started just as Bitwarden is now with a free account for all and only $1 per month for premium accounts. As of this post, Lastpass is now charging $36 a yr, which is not that bad, but going back to $12 a yr with Bitwarden just sounds like something I want to try out. Again you only have to pay if you want the premium account, but the basic free account looks very feature solid.
One feature I'm used to is the "recent sites used" list, that's handy for sites you use frequently.
-------------------------
list
Has some good things going for it. Like that you can easily copy the username or password with one click, right from the list, but it desperately needs autofill functionality.

Also needs the ability to add custom fields.

Add those two things, and it will definitely be the best manager out there.
-------------------------
filter
Truly amazing and impressive. Finally can leave lastpass for good!!

Update:
Still lacking some needed features, still can't leave lastpass although lastpass is only half-working and broken now. Any updates on when you will add the ability to have in input field as well as to filter as you type in input field?

Can't recommend highly enough. The free version provides all great functionality. The premium version is $10 a year.
1) Has browser extensions for all the major browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and Safari)
2) Can be used as the default password manager on iOS & Android
3) Has a desktop app for OS, Windows, and Linux
4) Is synced to the cloud while being zero knowledge encrypted
5) Has built in TOTP 2FA
6) Allows you to export your passwords in json, csv, and plaintext (TOTP shared secret is included unlike other services)
7) Has a random username, password, and pass phrase generator

It is the ideal solution for platform independent password storage. It also perfectly balances security with usability (cloud sync but zero knowledge and only decrypts/encrypts data on the local device & includes TOTP generator). 

I don't frequently buy software. Bitwarden is the exemption because of its excellence. I have recommended it to all my family and friends.

It's really a great product
Just one thing I would be really happy with - seems that LastPass and the Chrome default password managers are much more alert to signups I do, and suggest saving the password.
Bitwarden does that too but less often significantly and that's too bad, i manually insert passwords and add sites all the time... please improve it

Fantastic password manager, I can't recommend enough. Easy to use, simple design, great default settings, always works, cross-platform, many handy features and quality of life improvements, frequent updates, top notch security and privacy, very feature rich free-tier and high bang-for-buck paid personal and business accounts, such a great experience.

Suggestion, not sure if it's only me, but I would like to keep the Bitwarden dialog open while i navigate to other browser's tabs, especially while i am generating passwords or doing some configurations.

I like this better than LastPass, too, mostly because the mobile app is so much easier to use than the LastPass one. Interface on browser is also simpler than my previous one (LP). I don't use autofill (not sure where you activate it) but it's simple to select off the extension.

This is Great! It does everything any average internet user would need - including use across multiple devices for free! I'm moving out of 1Password for this reason. Sure, I do kind of miss all the built in categories and nice looking interface, but overall I like it. One feature I miss is being able to unlock the browser extension with "Touch ID" on my mac laptop. It does however work with "Face ID" on the iPhone, and you can use Touch ID to unlock the app on the mac - just not the browser extension.

Lifelong Apple devotee here who also uses Chrome browser and some of the Google business products (all on macOS/iOS devices) for work purposes... BitWarden is my go-to password manager and I'll likely never ever go back to the other market competitors that I tried previously (LastPass, Keeper, & 1Password). That being said, there are times BitWarden is not perfect like I so desperately, and, if I'm being honest, unreasonably, want it to be which occasionally leads me to reconsider switching everything over to Keychain/iCloud. But overall, I recommend BitWarden to most users and I am eager to see how the product evolves over time. Thanks!

By FAR the best password management out there.  For anyone looking to get away from Chrome try Brave; it's an excellent chromium based Internet browser, great combo.  I forgot to mention, it can install 99% of the Google Chrome's extensions.

I am yet another former LastPass user ( for many years a paid user) and could not be happier with Bitwarden. I am a true cross-platform user- Android, ChromeOs and Windows, and find the app on Android and the browser extension to meet all of my needs and to be very user-friendly. On my Android phone, suggested entries for a variety of site come up on the suggested text line of my keyboard- a super feature as my wife and I have multiple accounts on a number of sites and it will allow me to select the desired one. 

The fact the software is open-source is also a huge bonus.

Migrating from 1Password, I really love Bitwarden, it has so much to offer, easier to migrate all the passwords from browsers and other password managers. I am going Premium to support the developers. The extension is really simple to use, totally recommended
-------------------------

Bitwarden got it right! Being a responsible web citizen is finally kind of fun! Something about Bitwarden and its' app ecosystem makes me want to add passwords as often as possible - because regardless of device I can rely that all my data is up to date and without delay. 

Other password managers are great. Some robust - but with most other password managers the handoff between the native app and browser extensions has always felt a bit clunky. Bitwarden truly feels like an extension of my digital self.
-------------------------

Equally as good or better than LastPass plus Free on all platforms. IF you refuse to read the instructions or google for help, it might take some trail and error to get Bitwarden working properly in all browsers and applications on all platforms. But, it does work everywhere! There is no sacrifice of features or service at the reduced price of FREE!
-------------------------

I needed a new password manager since LastPass decided that everyone needs to pay to use their service. I found BitWarden and I haven't looked back. BW works extremely well (better than LP ever did) in both my browser and on my phone. The fact that I can share it with my partner is even better!
-------------------------

Migrated from LastPass - amazing how much better this tool is. It actually works on multiple devices and browsers. Very easy to migrate from other password managers - the import guides are very intuitive and detailed.
-------------------------
browser
The transition from LastPass was super easy - export, import, remove browser extension, add browser extension, remove app, install app, verify and test. On the Android, don't forget to Enable the Auto-fill Services under settings. You probably want to adjust your preferred time-outs, etc. And YES, the free version allows for one two-person "organization", so you can still share passwords with one other person. The interface is quite similar yet feels cleaner. It's going to work just as great if not better. Thanks Bitwarden!
-------------------------
browser
Switched from Last Pass - good idea to read some of these reviews as some good tips for usability.
If you use on desktop/PC don't forget to download the W10 application. It is a cleaner interface than the Browser extension for editing and reviewing.
A useful feature of Bitwarden over Lastpass is you can get your passwords as a guest on ANY browser. This feature just "saved my bacon" trying to deal with my bank on a locked account. 

Make sure to use Incognito mode then login to https://vault.bitwarden.com obviously be careful doing this and close everything up when done. I'm sold on Bitwarden and if I still feel the same next month will go premium to thank the developers.

Another LastPass refugee here....read reviews here as was PCMag.com's review and trying it out. First impressions are very good: love the x-platform (mobile and desktop browser) functionality. Was easy to export credentials from LastPass and import into Bitwarden Vault within a web browser. Tried out the Android mobile app (I have an employer-issued iPhone also but primarily on my Android phone) and it works very well. Like the choice of color schemes (using 'Nord'). So far so good - probably going to spend the $10 to support this product offering. Well done!

I migrated from Lastpass ,having used both paid and free versions for a number of years now.  I must say the migration was far simpler than I anticipated. 
  LP was slightly more intuitive but certainly not a deal breaker.
  So far I am finding Bitwarden to be easy to work with and functioning well across a number of browsers and Android.
  So far I am liking experience. Thank you to the Devs.

I have used LastPass for the past 10 to 12 years and, to be honest, have been quite happy with it. I have several PCs and also tablets and phones so with their new pricing system I would have had to pay something like ¬£30 a year to simply stand still. I have installed Bitwarden on all my devices and browsers and I have to say I am more than happy with it. It does everything that LastPass did and, in fact, does some things better. I have been using Bitwarden for the past few days and can highly recommend it. First class and easy to use password manager.

Absolute best password manager. It has all of the best features a password manager could have: end-to-end encrypted cloud storage, a browser extension, local app, mobile apps and 2FA for your account. BUT it's also open-source, allows for self-hosting (so you don't have to use their cloud), and even integrates TOTP codes into your login entries. 

My favorite thing is that it's polished. It will automatically put the 2FA code into your clipboard when it autofills a website. It's the little things that count.

I've been a premium, then families member of Lastpass for many years. After an increasing number of glitches, the mess of native vs. web app and the fact their macOS full installer was last updated in 2017! I finally took the plunge and switched away. Bitwarden is totally brilliant, the iOS, desktop and browser interfaces are much less glitchy than Lastpass, and the company seems far more focussed on this product than Logmein. Password sharing with my partner is more elegant and simple than Lastpass. I only really miss the hardcopy two-factor option of Lastpass I liked to use when travelling. 

Though price is not an important factor to me (good tools are worth paying for), the fact Bitwarden, a better product, is cheaper is icing on the cake‚Ä¶

I love using Bitwarden. 

It's been my go-to password manager after I found out that there are password managers out there that don't limit you to one account (Looking at you, Lastpass). 

Bitwarden is also pretty secure. Don't take my word for it, I'm not a security expert, but from what I've gathered online it uses ~about the same encryption as Lastpass (AES-CBC 256-bit encryption) while being free. You can also opt to use two-factor authentication if you're worried, which is what I've gone and done. 

Bottom line, super great password manager, recommend for you to start using it right away. 

(p.s: If you're a LastPass user looking to switch, it's extremely easy to do so).

Best encrypted password extension out there

Bitwarden got it right! Being a responsible web citizen is finally kind of fun! Something about Bitwarden and its' app ecosystem makes me want to add passwords as often as possible - because regardless of device I can rely that all my data is up to date and without delay. 

Other password managers are great. Some robust - but with most other password managers the handoff between the native app and browser extensions has always felt a bit clunky. Bitwarden truly feels like an extension of my digital self.
-------------------------
data
Migrated from LastPass. Their premium does not warrant the cost. Importing my data was super easy, interface is slick and quicker than what I am accustomed to. LP extension had a terrible interface that blocked most of the login list with buttons to other features (like vault etc). BitLocker has these options under another tab. Much better UI choice. Loving what I've seen so far. Inclined to support for the price of premium too!
-------------------------
data
Long time LastPass user and needed a new password manager after they changed it to a one device use; Was able to import all my LastPass data in less than a minute. BitWarden's interface is, in my opinion, better than LastPass.
-------------------------
data
I just imported all my data from Lastpass and so far things have gone well and the process was pretty easy. Once I have used for a while I will give the full 5 star I think this app deserves(or not)
-------------------------
data
I was a LastPass user for a long time. I really liked it but all that time I couldn't filly have peace in mind because after all I had no idea who might have access to my data. I was trying out different open-source self-hosted alternatives but all of them lacked important features such as mobile app integrations or buggy autofill. 
But when I found out about Bitwarden it finally solved my problem. I easily imported all my LastPass data into Bitwarden. The user experience is also much better than LastPass and I have self-hosted the solution on the cloud, employing high security measures such as database encryption, disc encryption, encryption in-transit, key rotation and ip-address filtering. Finally I can sleep well!
I am even considering subscribing to a premium plan even though I don't really need it but I want to show my support for the developers. They really solved a big trouble for me.
-------------------------
encrypt
Absolute best password manager. It has all of the best features a password manager could have: end-to-end encrypted cloud storage, a browser extension, local app, mobile apps and 2FA for your account. BUT it's also open-source, allows for self-hosting (so you don't have to use their cloud), and even integrates TOTP codes into your login entries. 

My favorite thing is that it's polished. It will automatically put the 2FA code into your clipboard when it autofills a website. It's the little things that count.
-------------------------

excellent password manager allowing me to manage passwords and other sensitive data across chrome, firefox, iphone, ipad, android.

So good I insisted my kids all installed it on thier devices
-------------------------
data
Very intuitive and the best password manager by far I've used so far. Very easy to set up and import all your passwords to. Highly recommend for security reasons to get this password manager and get the premium. $10 per year? That's the price of a coffee here in NYC. So 10 bucks per year for a piece of mind and knowing that all my accounts are secure is a very small price to pay. I could not say enough good things about bitwarden. I know this is just the extension review but it doesn't matter. It's open source so you can check the code and add to it if you want. I love that as well. All the passwords get encrypted when you store them in the cloud so there's no way of security breach even if they decided to go evil (which I seriously doubt) but even then all your data is encrypted and protected. Absolutely a must have in today's world. ****DISCLAIMER*** I am not getting paid nor am i affiliated with bitwarden in anyway. This is 100% true review from a customer perspective. Thank you Bitwarden for the piece of mind and freedom to know that all my accounts are safe and secure.

Moved all my data from LastPass to BitWarden in an instant, UI is great and intuitive, no icons on login forms, and it is open source! 
Go get it!

Bitwarden is the absolute best of the best! Fully encrypted, open sourced, and incredibly user friendly. One of my favorite and most frequently used tools. I certainly appreciate it!
-------------------------
data
Exactly what I was looking for. Please Support (if you're in a financial position to do so) the Developers and help to keep this open source software free and therefore independent from the prying eyes of the big Tech companies who already have all our data. Imagine if you'd trusted Facebook with all your passwords?...
-------------------------
data
Better UI/UX than anyone else (Last Pass, Dashlane, etc). Open source and the extensions lets you connect to a self-hosted server so your data never leaves your control. 5/5
-------------------------
data
OK. Makes sense. I'd like to clear my clipboard after copying sensitive data.
-------------------------
data
Been using Dashlane for a long a time and stumbled upon this through Reddit. It's definitely worth your time (at least as a trial) for a few reasons:

1. It's super lightweight and easy to use. Dashlane is a complete resource hog by comparison

2. It's open source. That keeps a company honest which is a huge deal when talking about sensitive data

3. Kyle (no it's not me)- the lead developer is awesome and super responsive. We worked together resolve a Dashlane data import issue and it works flawlessly now. That sort of attention and service should be recognized.

The one downside (to some, not all) is that Bitwarden lacks auto-form fill and payments. Kyle has stated those are coming down the road. So far, I'd say it's worth my time to keep using it and wait for those new features.
-------------------------
data
Continuously improving and expanding the feature set. Has always been reliable and sync works perfectly across all my computers, laptops, phones and tablets. 

Most features that I could think to ask for are already in development if not already implemented.

My only request would be the option to minimize (close) the folders when viewing the entire vault on the android app so that it matches the chrome extension.

I have 20 folders all full of data. Having to scroll through ALL of the entries to get to the contents of a folder that starts with "W" isn't ideal.

Otherwise, keep up the good work and I'll keep recommending it everyone I know.
-------------------------
data
Looks great and correct me if I'm wrong, however it doesn't seem to support auto login / login to site in the chrome extension.

But love the UI, much nicer than password keeper and dashlane. Will stick with it for a while and see if the auto login makes it to the bundle.

Also would be nice if it would offer to save form data after a successful login to an unknown site.

I got this extension after listening to my favorite Linux Podcast "Destination Linux". They were being continuously sponsored by Bit Warden. They were really loving how fast and secure this app is and I agree. It helps me feel like I am finally taking back control of my password management without going broke.

Free and open source, sync on all platforms, very light, and easy interface. what's not to like! definitely recommend it.

The only password manager the world will ever need. It has all the important features, including cloud sync on an unlimited amount of devices, on any platform, for the very competitive price of nothing.
It's also open source which automatically gives it an advantage over the alternatives.

Bitwarden does have a paid subscription, but you don't miss out on almost anything if you use it for free, and the subscription is only $10 a year. That's less for a year than most alternatives for a month. And even though it is that cheap, you don't even need to subscribe, I literally didn't know this premium membership even existed until today, after using Bitwarden for years.

In short, why even bother thinking about other password managers? Bitwarden does everything they do, it's free and open-source, it's fast and efficient, it's simply excellent.

Longtime LastPass user; went looking for an alternative due to them restricting the free version to a single device type. A bit of research determined that not only does BitWarden have the functionality I wanted, it's open-source so I no longer have a doubt in the back of my mind about losing all my info if the company shuts down.

Functionality is smooth as butter, better customization than LP, and moving my passwords over from LP was lighting fast. You need this extension!

This is my all-time favorite password manager. Works great in Chrome, as well on Android. It does everything I need. I really like the simple UI in the Chrome extension and if it could stay forever that way, I would be happy for that ‚Äì it's very easy to get used to, and fast to navigate in.
I also love plans & pricing, where Basic plan offers you very good and unlimited basic experience. I soon decided to go for the paid plan as one-time passwords and also file attachments, were very useful for me.
Overall, this is a great extension that I really love using and never looked back since I started.

Just switched over from LastPass.  Importing my passwords from LastPass to BitWarden was easy.  Love the speed and smoothness of BitWarden.
-------------------------
fast
I've been with Lastpass for a long time, and the price went from $12, to $24, and now $36.  So I began looking for an alternative.  And I'm glad I did.  I love Bitwarden.  It works, just works, and it's quicker than Lastpass. It was so fast that I ended up cleaning up my passwords, a task I'd been putting off in Lastpass.  It will do analysis as well - reused passwords, hacked accounts etc.  And has options Lastpass doesn't - you can stand up your own server if you like.

Love the Android app as well - quick/clean.  I've abandoned Lastpass.

As a side note: I had a small issue when I exported my Lastpass to a CSV. It wouldn't import into Bitwarden.  I emailed support, and BAM I had a response very quickly, they solved my issue.  Later when I had another problem BAM they responded again very quickly.  I'm not used to this level of service.  It was just one more (very important) thing that caused me to convert. 

I'd highly recommend Bitwarden.

I was so happy I upgraded to Premium to support them.  Even though I didn't have to, and I have almost a year left on my Lastpass subscription.
-------------------------
light
I hated LastPass so deeply. I've been using Bitwarden for almost a year now, and, while there are some parts which could make my life more comfortable, it's just light years better than LastPass. Had a friend who worked on LastPass, he said their code was so tangled, it was practically impossible to fix bugs or add new features. No wonder that there's such a great difference. Thanks, Bitwarden guys!

Awesome password manager! The best one that I have tried so far and trust me I have tried a boat load of them! I love the Android app too! I just wish the Android App had one option that is missing. 

Can you have the big letter of the alphabet pop up on the right hand side when we are scrolling up or down in our login list?

You know how the "Contacts" app in Android 10 will pop up different letters of the alphabet on the right hand side when we are scrolling through our contacts? That is what I want in the android app for Bitwarden! I have a huge list of logins and if I could swipe up or down and get the big letter of the alphabet to pop up on the right hand side like it does in the contacts app that would surely speed up which login item I am trying to scroll to. Mine list is really long and it would speed me up in a quick hurry if I could select the alphabet letter on the right to go to the "T" section. Does this make sense? If not email me and I will send u a screenshot of what I am talking about.

Thanks a ton for this great app (and it still even works on Windows 7! Awesome!)

Coming from LastPass, the UI and speed improvements are the best features of Bitwarden. However, LastPass does have a better AutoLogin experience. Nevertheless, Bitwarden is fast, efficient, open source (big thumbs up here), and doesn't seem to interrupt me as much as LastPass seemed to do. Also, the features in Bitwarden keep growing.

I could never get into apps like lastpass they were very invasive even causing problems like slowing down my pc but Bitwarden is great it doesnt do anything but lock up my passwords and has my back when i need them 100% happy i found out about this program from some random youtube video about free programs you should know about. this definitely was number one
-------------------------

Pain-free transfer from Last-Pass (except a 10000+ character note, at least currently not supported). Bitwarden has caught all sites I've been able to test it on and is quite user-friendly.
Only thing that is slightly worse is that the sync between devices isn't instant as it is in Lastpass - but it is still generally very fast (and not an issue for me in 99,9% of cases).
-------------------------

Love it.

Easy to use. Light.

Open source. For those of you that are unfamiliar with the term, basically means that other software engineers can check under the hood, dismantle it, make sure it's designed correctly, secure, etc.

Feels refreshing to use a piece of software that is this polished.

Really good, dependable, solid password manager.  Very impressed.  Having tried most, I have to say this ticks all the right boxes.  Smooth, fast, intuitive and really secure.  I've been using Bitwarden for over a year now and it's the best out there by miles!

Used to be a LastPass user, but grew tired of their bugs and lack of responsiveness to support requests. Bitwarden feels light and nimble. Love that it's open source. Works great across my 2 Macs and iPhone. Happy to pay the small fee for the premium membership!

I have been a long time Lastpass user and though I only just installed and started using Bitwarden, I can see it shows great value and promise. I started looking for a Lastpass alternate due to the fast increase in price. Lastpass started just as Bitwarden is now with a free account for all and only $1 per month for premium accounts. As of this post, Lastpass is now charging $36 a yr, which is not that bad, but going back to $12 a yr with Bitwarden just sounds like something I want to try out. Again you only have to pay if you want the premium account, but the basic free account looks very feature solid.
One feature I'm used to is the "recent sites used" list, that's handy for sites you use frequently.
-------------------------

I wanted to switch from lastpass, 'cause I hate it. it is slow and stupid. 
At first, this extension looked promising, but after I tried to login into booking.com user area, I now think, that bitwarden developers have a lot to do. Auto fill did not work in a popup window. Also, by default, it collects analytics, i.e. downloads a javascript from google.com, which is I think could be a playground for a MITM (Man-in-the-middle) attack, or basically , this function must be off by default or removed completely.
I like the user interface though. Simple and functional. Keep up the good work.

Very nice, unobstrusive, fast and sleek. I love it. After years with Lastpass, it's a bit of fresh air. Support it!!

Simple, fast, secure. 

Refreshing that a program this good is free. 
It makes me want to pay for it anyway. So I shall be paying for premium even though the "basic" version is already perfect.

Five stars with some reservations. Bitwarden is fast, clean and simple. I no longer use LastPass. However my bank has two login pages, username/password and a PIN page. Bitwarden can't pick that up. You can set up custom text fields but I don't know enough HTML to drill down and find it. Also form fill for credit cards often leaves information out. 

Still Bitwarden is the best of them all.

I closed my LastPass account for BitWarden. Great app. Very polished, fast, and easy to use.

Don't listen to Tim below. Most of what he said is untrue. Try it yourself and you will see.

I have been searching for a password manager that provides syncing across devices without having to pay premium fees (I live in a third world country, so paying for lastpass so I can have my passwords randomized and accessible across all devices is not an easy endeavor financially)

Then after finding out about Bitwarden, I did my research and decided to try it out. 

And all I can say is that I love it so far. It's light, responds much faster in terms of opening the vault compared to lastpass.

I want to use it for my business in terms of sharing work related logins, but it still doesn't have the share password functionality like lastpass, but I hope that it will be added in the future.

Im still going to be using bitwarden personally, and for the first time in my life all my passwords are randomized instead of me using the same 3-4 passwords for all my logins.
