Best ad blocker out here! You can even decide what gets blocked and what doesn't. 
Haven't had a single problem with it. Don't believe me? Try it, you wont be disappointed.
-------------------------
block
reccomend it, you can force block ads. SO GOOOD IM NOT JOKING
-------------------------
block
It Blocks ALL YT ADs
-------------------------
block
it is stupid it blocked YT!
-------------------------
block
allows you to even block those stupid ads that pop up after the page loads so that most adblocks cant block it. also you can break websites by blocking random elements/cookies and i think thats very funny
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus has been very effective in blocking advertising and websties. On occasion a website comes up that I don't want blocked and it is easy to unblock those websites.
-------------------------
block
As more and more sites are blocking adblock forcing users to disable adp, unless adp comes up with a way to bypass these, it has started to become a bit useless.
-------------------------
block
The free version does NOT block utube ads. It does block SOME ads on google, but I am being continually harassed to 'upgrade' ad blocker. This is in itself a virus - a very intrusive one.
-------------------------
block
this adblock is so slay even blocks yt ads
-------------------------
block
used to be great till recently but no longer blocks Ads on channel 5 and sometimes on youtube. i have the latest updates etc and still blocks the start of various proggrams until the software is disabled very dissapointed
-------------------------

Not Blocking any ADS & I've updated several times now.

Adblock Plus is terrible at blocking ads.
-------------------------
block
it blocks ads... like what its supposed to do... haven't seen any ads since i installed this like 2 years ago
-------------------------
block
Misses a lot of Ads. 'Block element' doesn't even work anymore.
-------------------------
block
Has provided great service for me for a long time but in recent weeks has become very erratic wrt ad blocking!? 🤔😒
-------------------------
block
needs a new update its not blocking ads on youtube anymore
-------------------------
block
Helped me block 585 ad on a page
-------------------------
block
Been using this extension for years now. Love it!! For those who complain it still shows some ads, you need to go into the options and untick "Show acceptable ads". You can also specify ads on pages but that's a bit more detailed to explain.
It used to block ads in the middle of videos on Facebook, but they changed their coding so it no longer blocks them, but it still blocks ads everywhere else!
-------------------------
block
It blocks every single ad from existence. Definitely download this if you hate ads.
-------------------------
block
Does not block ads, but it does try to block any article I try to read
-------------------------
block
Great Job blocking all of those ad's really had me thinking I was crazy
-------------------------
block
Recently this has not been blocking ads. Not sure what the problem is. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, but ads are showing up now. Switching to a different ad blocker.
-------------------------
block
AdBlocker, has only blocked something thatI need to see
-------------------------
block
This extension did not even work at all and blocked a total of 0 ads
-------------------------
block
It was a great extension, but since it no longer block annoying facebook video ads, I have to downgrade my review to 3 stars.
-------------------------
block
Does not block all ads or any on youtube. Some ads get through on google search. system seems to fail.
-------------------------
block
This extension is not working. It didn't block a SINGLE ad on YouTube. I finally found one that works. If you're looking for an adblocker that actually works, try this one: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblocker-for-yt/ldbflapfegfcoipoeophhjbgfcllmjip
-------------------------
block
Didn't block ads on AOL email. Wated my money!
-------------------------
block
lol, ad block plus now has recurring ad block plus ads that open a new tab asking for money even though you already paid.
-------------------------
block
it blocked the ads well
-------------------------
block
It worked fine till today...even deleted and reinstalled... but not blocking ads like before. no reload or refresh button is visible like before...just the DONATE button keeps popping up
-------------------------
block
I paid for ad block plus and still have nozens of ads poppinng up all the tine.  as I am writing this comment there are two ads off to the side, another ad just popped up.  I paid for it and it doesn't work,    I would like my money back.
-------------------------
block
Your Adblock plus pop ups are more more annoying than the adverts, They keep popping up over and over.  Please block them..
-------------------------
protect
my browser is more protected than my parents' sex
-------------------------
block
Well here is an UPDATE! NOW you suck, because if I want you to block all the ads I haver to reload every site I want the ads blocked!!!!STUPID!!!!!!!!! BLOCK ALL ADS ALL THE TIME - I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELOAD
A PAGE SO YOU CAN BLOCK ADS!!!! STUPID!!!!
-------------------------
block
Blocks 95% of ads
-------------------------
block
This is epic. it blocks all the annoying ads especially on youtube.
-------------------------
block
Blocked almost 1000000 ads.
-------------------------
protect
This is freaking amaizing it helps you protect yourself and stops all those 2 ads before a youtube video. while i have seen some ads on sites that show evan with this on it is amaizing and usualy things this good would need you to pay for them.
-------------------------
block
Problems
This adblocker worked for a few months but now it just shows how many ads there are in a site and doesnt block them at all/
-------------------------
block
This worked great and blocked all ads from my computer would recommend 100%
-------------------------
block
it used to run perfectly but it hasnt blocked any adds for the last two weeks
-------------------------
block
It stopped blocking elements on many sites. Ads seem to be getting more and more protected against Adblock Plus nowadays.
-------------------------
block
It worked perfectly fine until today i have it on and  everything i even reinstalled it but its just not working the same any more it says, it blocked 0 ads on every website i go on.
-------------------------
block
Does not block most ads after latest windows 10 update.
-------------------------
protect
protects from viruses somtimes and false advretisments too really good extention would recommend
-------------------------
block
Does what it is supposed to do. However, if you are a tab user, this is a memory hog. My browser overall is currently taking up 708 mb. This extension is a close second, taking up 705 mb. Wish it was less intensive, but still blocks ads.
-------------------------
block
doesnt block anything anymore used to be brilliant
-------------------------
block
It doesn't block Google ads. Google pays to be whitelisted. It's not possible to manually block these ads. All other adblockers I tried, successfully blocked all ads.
-------------------------
block
It blocks some ads, but not all ads. Luckily, you can use Block Element to block those other ads manually.
-------------------------
block
Awful extension. Add Block plus keeps showing up about 5 times a minute. Interferes with browser speed.
-------------------------
block
It was VERY good for a while but as many people pointed out, it has become less and less effective at blocking ads.
-------------------------
block
BLOCKS ADS
-------------------------
block
it is blocking facebook feeds in the current version. please fix it. thanks.
-------------------------
detect
I wish it could by pass websites abilities to detect adblockers and force you to turn them off. Otherwise it does a great job keeping the noise of a page down!
-------------------------
block
I understand Facebook and Adblock Plus are duking it out. I had to disable AP on FB because it was blocking all posts. Please come to a truce soon. Thanks.
-------------------------
block
cracked bro blocks everything
-------------------------
block
Very helpful and blocks all the ads, youtube premium is worthless now
-------------------------
block
The extension blocks the ads, that's for sure. But, I think it fails to stop the trackers, as I see products I searched for on google ads extensively. This extension needs finer control options and information separately on ads and trackers, as the built-in controls in Opera or Edge. So far, this extension is only for ads and to my observation, it fails with trackers.
-------------------------
block
This is "honor-ware" which means it's not free. The lowest price you can pay is $5. False advertising at it's finest. If you don't pay, it will work for two or three days then just stop blocking ads and you have to reinstall it where it asks you for money AGAIN. "free ad blocker"
-------------------------
block
ABP is blocking my subtitles when i watch shows and i cant do anything about it.
-------------------------
block
It works, but it blocks things that weren't ads at all, like I went to a login page and it was COMPLETELY GRAYED out. I turned of ABP and it worked. Please make this "worse".
-------------------------
block
This is Awesome and blocking all site automatically . But the the problem is allowed sites are still blocking .
-------------------------
block
Freaking absolutely pitiful. The goal of this app is to BLOCK pop ups. I am getting SLAMMED by damn pop ups FROM THIS APP begging for money. This is so annoying.
-------------------------
block
Used to be good. It's no longer blocking Twitch ads. And most news sites as well simply detect it and have a pop-up that blocks viewing the page, which defeats the purpose.
Been like this a while and they still haven't found a way around this, I might as well uninstall and try others.
-------------------------
block
Not blocking ads at all on my old lap top, video ads, pop overs, pop unders and tab openers along with full efulu ads on Youtube - completely useless
-------------------------
block
Good for most websites but blocking youtube ads stopped working recently, so just 3 stars
-------------------------
block
Its so simple it doesn't harm you in any way at all, and it blocks literally everything. If for some reason you want ads on a certain page, you can just enable them for that website. I have no issue with it
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus is becoming more & more useless by the day as websites keep blocking the extension from working & have adblock detectors, most recently Dailymotion has become another victim of the growing anti-adblock movement, and the day that adblock stops working on YouTube (hasn't happened yet) i will be deleting this extension for good
-------------------------
detect
Worse than useless, every website can detect it, and you have to take the extra step to go turn it off on every site before it loads.  Is this being worked on?
-------------------------
block
bad only removed six and I had it on for 3 days then i left my other one on and it blocked 1000
-------------------------
block
Useless! It block around one in 6 ads.
-------------------------
block
Occasionally you get sophisticated workarounds or new webpages with ads still showing, but so far the extension has blocked 10k ads in a few months, so fantastic job to the devs for this! 

One example of ads still showing is when you search a product on google, occasionally the first 3-4 URLs displayed are ads and have the ad tag. This doesn't always happen though.
-------------------------
block
not blocking popups on right hand corner of screen un able to use full screen
-------------------------
block
Works pretty well on famous websites and most websites like youtube
but sometimes in some websites it doesnt block anything at all and I do not know the cause for this, I normally just report the issue but I don't think they add those websites or anything.
-------------------------
block
This app has blocked a few million ads from my eyes over time used with Ublock origin. Let that number sink in. That is ten ads a day for 250+ years, except in less than 2 years. Ads are becoming much more obnoxious, invasive, and unethical. The idea of computers was complete user control, and we need to retain this, not support those who would try to turn it onto a television or worse. Thank you for your hard work ABP crew :)

Can't allow ads on all sites and just block on certain.
-------------------------

Was awesome.  Now creates a bug with google.messages preventing it from loading or working at all even when disabled for the specific page.
-------------------------
block
Good extension for ad blocking, but need bit more accuracy.
-------------------------
block
The best.  Have been using for years and I contribute to the site every year.  I play a Hearts game a lot online and ABP has blocked over a million annoying ads on that site. It makes me question these ad people.  They need a less annoying way to portray their product.  Try giving people an option of viewing your ads and make them interesting, informative, amusing, etc.  Instead, a lot of ad people deliberately try to make their ads unwatchable.
-------------------------
block
Bye bye stupid ads! No more video ads or 'acceptable' ads! ABP has blocked so many annoying ads that I don't ever want to see again.

A tip: Turn on the Anti Adblock Block filter in Settings and teach the money-hungry websites a lesson by disabling their "disable your adblocker" pop-ups!
-------------------------
block
Was working good, now it either doesn't block ad's on Fox News or it does and it doesn't allow you to scroll down the page. I have reported this several times and nothing gets fixed. I end up having to turn it off on any page I look at for Fox News. This also happens on CNN.
-------------------------

Blocking ads is so important in today's world as we are constantly bombarded by advertisements. Ads with video that appear while I am reading are especially distracting and detrimental to my productivity. I cannot count how many times I have to refocus my attention on the content I am trying to read just to get through one webpage! THANK YOU for offering this service and giving me my focus and productivity back.
-------------------------
block
I usually forget I've got it. Occasional glitches when changing other settings but things quickly get back to normal. I love life without adverts. They're just visual pollution and I hate pollution. I understand the need for some people to earn revenue but if the adverts are annoying, I'll block them. (Sad fact: Most ads are annoying!) Good content providers get a monthly donation on Patreon from me. Hint hint.
-------------------------
block
262K ad blocked, i loce it
-------------------------
block
ABP is doing a pretty good job blocking unwanted and annoying adds.
-------------------------
block
Constantly keeps harassing me to buy the premium version when I manually block something.. It does this roughly every third time.

It's more annoying thin what I'm using it for.
-------------------------
block
Wait no I realised it can block youtube ads too soo its just super useful.
-------------------------
block
This blocks all of the adds you can find.
-------------------------
block
Don't know how this one was any different from the first one I downloaded, deleted and left feedback but i guess i was using the first one wrong? Or this one, i dunno... Either way, complained about how the first one didnt block youtube ads and now this one blocks youtube ads. Thats everything I can ask for.
-------------------------
block
This app sucks! It does not work like it use to. It does not block any of the ads on YouTube, Yahoo or Feebay (eBay).
-------------------------
block
It blocked all the Youtube ads, right now on Youtube it's blocking 36 ads! and in total it blocks 42,718 ads! you should install it!
-------------------------
block
Used to love this adblocker, but recently it's stopped blocking ads. YES, I do still have it turned on. The ads are periodically being blocked, then not blocked on various sites (like gmail, or youtube, or streaming/download sites where you specifically WANT ads/popups to be blocked). Huge disappointment after it working so well for so long.
-------------------------
block
it was good but now it cant even block youtube premium pop-up
-------------------------
block
Its nice but now when I see it blocked an ad on sites i use it feels like the sites betrayed me
-------------------------
block
Blocks most things instantly, and the windows that do go through get blocked almost instantly after they show up, great app!
-------------------------
block
wanted a simple banner ad blocker.
0 banners blocked by this extension.
utterly useless.
-------------------------
block
it only works some of the time and wont block elements on pages like its supposed to
-------------------------
block
Nice web extension, it can actually block intrusive ads and unnecessary ads.

though it rarely block redirect ads that is so annoying, I wish the devs fix this. ty.
-------------------------
block
work really well blocks every ad
-------------------------
block
Blocked so many ads
-------------------------
block
Looks like this extension is finally getting thrown out the window now that Youtube has decided to bypass their ad system against this. Are there any alternatives that can block Youtube ads like this one could?
-------------------------
block
It doesnt even block ads, it literally just asks for money
-------------------------
block
Crazy, it blocks every ad
-------------------------
block
I got it in 2021 and it still blocks ads on YouTube in early 2022
-------------------------
block
it blocks ads i cant complain its great
-------------------------
block
Most pages still show ads, even with it "operational". I can manually block the ads by using the manual block tool but that seems to defeat the purpose of the ad-blocker. Also, so many websites detect ABP and make you disable it in order to view their page, so you end up turning it off anyways and seeing adds. Either way, I see ads on 90% of the pages I visit, either because I'm forced to disable ABP to see the page or it just doesn't do its job.
-------------------------
block
best  for ad blocking  in browser
-------------------------
block
I used to believe this was the greatest adblocker ever. But lately it appears that it allows adds on certain sites, no matter what options you chose. Facebook owned sites are the worst by far for pop-ups, but Google owned sights are sneaking them in sometimes too. Youtube (Owned by Google) seems to be the only place where video ads actually get blocked.
-------------------------
block
it really blocked my 1000 of ads. very much productive
-------------------------
block
Man! i love it, i'd use this extension for couple months and it really blocked all ads
-------------------------
block
Been using ABP for a while, but seems to be blocking less ads over time.
-------------------------
block
AdBlock Plus allows certain ads intentionally, uBlock Origin blocks all ads and is open source, so I'd suggest using uBlock Origin instead.
-------------------------
block
its completely work for real i can also block some ads that were not block too
-------------------------
block
This use to be fantastic. Now, it block stuff I don't want it to block, because they want to to use their new paid version. so, this one is stopping working. I'm just getting a different one. Way too many free ones ot pay these guys $30 a year. NOT $30 once a lifetime, but $30 a year. Total trash company now.
-------------------------
block
It helps but without any way to see what is being blocked on a site it's impossible to know what caused a site to break.
-------------------------
block
Doesnt work in Chrome to block youtube adds
-------------------------
block
Don't bother. This USED To be the best, but they are now bribed by all the ad companies to not block ads or popups anymore. I switched to another one called "Ublock Origin" which actually was created by the original creator of this app, back when this used to be good before they took bribes from the ad companies. After switching away from this, I can finally use sites and download stuff without the fake virus downloads and fake download popups showing up anymore.

THE ABSOLUTE TOP AD BLOCKING APP.
IS IT SOOOOOO GOOD NO CAP.
WORKS FOR EVERY WEBSITE AND EVEN YOUTUBE ADS! YAY
-------------------------
block
Blocks everything!!!
-------------------------
block
it work amazingly, I use it all the time. Sometimes maybe one or two ads still come through, but majority are blocked.
-------------------------
block
Blocks out all those annoying adds, everything on You Tube and Face Book.
-------------------------

jury is out on this ad block.   Blocks what I don't want but lets other things through.  I deleleted capital purchasing yet it still pops up annoying
-------------------------
block
only needs to be able to block twitch ad interruptions.
-------------------------
block
Does the job and blocks the ad.
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus is really a great extension to have!!!  It blocks ALL the unnecessary ads' and  cookies.
This is a must have!!!
-------------------------
block
Didn't block ads. I don't really need to say anything more than that. Just absolutely doesn't do what it's supposed to do.
-------------------------
block
Does not load automatically. Whatever website you go to, it'll load ALL the ADS first, then you need to click the extension to RELOAD the page, and even then it only blocks a few ads. There are always ads on pages that I have used this extension with.
-------------------------
block
"Block cookie warning" has never worked. It instead replaces the cookie banner with another that says "addon interfering with blah blah blah" and each time it has a different unique object id that just doesn't stay blocked.
-------------------------
block
I've been using this for 2 or 3 years from a discord friend. It blocks YouTube, ROBLOX, websites to watch things on, ect. The settings can be changed to your liking too.
-------------------------
block
Best for blocking redirection, but does not work for pop ups.
Anyways, thanks!

I have adblock plus on chrome and have contributed many times   Lately I am constantly getting Keto ads. I block one and another comes up from another person or site.   They show Ophrah or Dr Oz.   I have reported them as spam and they just keep coming from different advertisers.
-------------------------
block
I noticed that today I got an insane spam from youtube even when the video is not playing. The number of adds blocked keeps going up by the second. It doesn't seem to be on all videos. It's some "blocked by client error" that keeps repeating. This is the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDLli3ljKl0
-------------------------
block
Thank you for blocking annoying ad.
-------------------------
block
used to be great but today blocking my access to my browser unless I pay "suggested amounts" up to $50 or they ask you to pay an amount that you think is fair but the minimum amount is $5... good bye!
-------------------------
block
I like it. it  blocks every ad I see but sometimes I got to block the ads manually
-------------------------
block
it doesn't block YouTube ads even though it says it in the ad block title that it blocks YouTube ads. Highkey misleading but what can i do? For real though if anybody has any better ad block extensions that actually do what they say in the description, please don't hesitate to reply to my review!! :))
-------------------------
block
it can block ads from most sites but, when trying to download something from other sites, example of  heavy loads of ads site like megaup.net, it does block all ads but it can also detect and block the adblocker asking us to disable it first..same as most sites out there.
-------------------------
block
I've been using this free service for years and have become spoiled by it's wonderful seamless effectiveness!! So much so that it's  intolerable using websites like YouTube on my phone due to the barrage of garbage you're hit with constantly. Other websites have Google ads and others that take up  so much of the screen the content is no longer visible for over 3 flicks of the finger to scroll. Ridiculous!! Don't these people know that makes their websites look cheap and shabby? I know this is likely a normal experience to most but being protected by ABP  on my laptop where I spend most of my time has reduced my tolerance to zilch. I'm not sure why I haven't installed it on this cell I got last May, other than the fact that I already have no internal storage left due to the auto-loaded garbage that cells come with today-and I only have FB (not messenger) installed out of the big 4 media sites. [Thanks, Amazon shopping app etc].  Again, ridiculous!
My only ABP complaint is one that I almost couldn't have made due to the Very recent discovery-then loss of the matter.  I'd just found that there was an option to zero in on certain areas where ads are generated and pop up regularly, which would allow you to select then block just that offense. Alas,  after doing a reset on my poorly advised Acer Chromebook (pretty much a glorified cell phone in itself), this feature is no longer listed in the options anywhere.  I'm not talking about the "Block pop-up ads" check box, but the one that prompted selecting a certain area, which would then become highlighted within a box and featured in confirming whether that is what you wanted blocked. 
Ah, well. Easy come, easy go. It's in no way a deal breaker.  ABP's service was already making my web browsing experience 100% better as it was,  so no real complaints here from me. Thank You!!

EDIT: Seems to be working now as it was before.

They updated something that it's blocking too much, most of the websites that use JavaScript just stopped working because it's just blocking the code. This started today, yesterday it was working just fine, even Twitch is no longer working now.
-------------------------
block
Same for me, it was blocking my isp page and wkikipedia
-------------------------
block
It's like they've suddenly decided all the formatting and images on majority of websites need blocking, makes it unusuable ):
-------------------------
block
Something went wrong with the extension, it aggressively blocking everything.
-------------------------
block
this extension has usually worked OK for me, but in the past few months there's been lots of issues. i've had to disable the extension on google docs, twitter, and now disney+ because it will break the website/make it impossible to use. google docs formatting was totally broken, i couldn't view twitter on desktop at all and disney+ gave me an "error 42" connection error message. they need to fix these issues, i'm considering downloading a different ad blocking extension
-------------------------
block
As of this morning, my company's website is completely krangled because ABP is blocking literally all non-text content on the site. What's the deal here?
-------------------------
block
Really liked this as an ad blocker until it started blocking product images on a bunch of websites. Wasn't doing it a few days ago but now I can't even go shopping online at places like Amazon without disabling this extension. Removing and using a different ad blocker that doesn't need micromanagement to use.
-------------------------
block
Issue reporting no longer works and it started blocking way too much, I can no longer log into Plex with this extension running and it even blocks CSS from sites like the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikipedia, which donÄt even run ads. THis is absolutley ridicolous, I'm uninstalling until I get an update!
-------------------------
block
Great software for blocking adverts i give it a 10/10 even though it may not block twitch adverts (because amazon is greedy) it has blocked over 5000 ads in the last 2 weeks
-------------------------
block
It did a great job of blocking the ads when viewing videos on YouTube, but it now blocks YouTube site to load video comments further. It caused a little trouble currently.
-------------------------
block
No more frustration from pop-ups, easy to turn off for sites that won't work with ad block apps and continues to block junk from the rest.
-------------------------
block
It blocked about 1.3M ad for me :)  Thx
-------------------------
detect
Sites detect that I had it, and when I turn it off, does nothing. Even removed it and sites won't work.
-------------------------
block
it doesnt block 15 second youtube ad that plays in the start of the video
-------------------------
bypass
i have noticed not pop ups and no ads when i am watching a video its like youtube preimuim but free i maybe a adblocking bypass would make it better overral i love this!
-------------------------
block
You could be right. Although, it isn't the Ad blocker's fault. YouTube has started using new technology blocking Ad blockers from blocking Ads which happened to me making me look for a new Ad blocker then I cam to this one.

very good , blocking most ads but need a pop-up blocker and update to block ads on Facebook and YouTube
-------------------------
block
Worked amazing for a good while and was FREE to boot. Now it blocks almost nothing and doesn't give you the opportunity to skip the donation. I got it because it was a free program but now it isn't worth getting and was astounding when used before.
-------------------------
block
lately doesnt work with youtube i mean at least not al the time like 50 percent of the ads cant be blocked
-------------------------
block
it works, but it ALSO blocks all 3rd party cookies entirely - so EVERY SINGLE website EVERY page asks over and over if i want to accept or block cookies - my settings one save - only way to stop that is to disable adblock
-------------------------
block
ok so i had the ad blocker on and it didnt block the ads that much. i still got ads
-------------------------
block
forgot to mention, it did block some yt ads
-------------------------
block
I Love this Extension its very useful and it does its job but one tiny problem about was when i was trying to block a title on youtube it made me block all title's now i cant unblock it i have no idea how to if anyone does please tell me.
-------------------------
block
I love this extension and been using it since it came out! but recently it doesnt block any of the ads when i watch videos on facebook!
-------------------------
prevent
Generally great, however since recently it causes it my chromebook that google docs get unusable. It removes line turns out of the sheets and prevents me from setting the cursor on any place but the the very right within the line
-------------------------
block
Now this extension is ruining my google docs. Do not recommend this at all. Go find something better if your're looking for an ad blocker. This can't even block all ads on YT anymore.
-------------------------
block
more than satisfied. a new kind of orgasm.
this stuff not does only block ads, but it also provides me the tool to kick out whatever i want. in so many different ways.
those 'sign-in- and email-requesting boxes? BAM! disappeared
those features in a specific app, like 'enlarge or minimize the word size'? BAM! vanished!

just literally any visible image appearing in a website possible, you can make it go away, this extension can even block a freight train!
-------------------------
block
No longer blocks Youtube ads
-------------------------
detect
I installed both Adblock and Adblock Plus. I may be compromising my computer's performance but there is nothing noticeable that I can detect, except not a one annoying ad anywhere! I am now going to activate the privacy feature and see how that performs.

Well, after that silly move I uninstalled Adblock and have been using ABP since 2014 and have no complaints that I can detect. However, maybe a pop-up blocker would be sufficient. I choose to enable ABP site by site.
-------------------------
block
I liked it, however some sites like FANDOM or other sites can bypass this, but, that's no match for ABP! You can block the element and completely remove the Ad no matter what
However
Some sites ask you to disable your AdBlocker, and if you block the element, some sites will generate a new one, so it is tricky to bypass those sites who want nothing but to have ads to bug you.

can be used for blocking certain porn

EDIT: Used to be good. Used to be extremely effective. I understand that advertising is a tricky business, but if an adblocker that ADVERTISES itself as an adblocker does not block ads... do I even have to explain how asinine that is? Well, after years of working exactly as intended I noticed that many, MANY ads were getting through on numerous websites. So I reached out to their customer support. I got a reply today... telling me that there are "circumventors." Well if that's the case, then the app needs to evolve to circument the circumventors. If it won't then it isn't doing it's job. So I tried another app. Get AdGuard AdBlocker, everyone.Use it until it stops working and then find a new one. 'Cause I predict that's how this whole thing is going to go. ABP doesn't work anymore. AdGuard works. For now. Welcome to the "Internet Annoyance Arms Race." You're gonna be here for the rest of your life.

detect
Also the blocker BRICKS a lot of websites, as they detect a blocker is being used therefore REFUSE to show any contents. Namely CNBC, Las Vegas Sun, Forbes, WSJ, and a ton of other sites. Other blockers do NOT have this issue. My 1 star review stands.

Amazing for all the ads and pop-ups on soap2day.to! It blocked 13 ads on the first 30 seconds of using it!
-------------------------
block
Great for blocking annoying ads.
-------------------------

Installed it on newest computer and was very disappointed.  Numerous ads still appeared.  Terms state that "acceptable" ads are allowed.  What a contradiction.  The developer writes an app to block ads, but then forces us to view "some".  The developer also states that they use cookies.  What a bait and switch.  One way or another, this app will ensure that merchandise will rule over us.  No, no, no.

I got this add blocker for website such as typing.com witch is a big add site. add blocker plus did a great job blocking it. i do wish that it blocked pop up blocks

I love it.
It  block ads on any websites by your convience you could remove it on a specific website.
It may be not works properly on malicious websites.
But it blocks most of the unusefull vulgar ads

Blocks Crunchyroll ads.

Do not install it doesn't even do the job it promises to do right at all it only blocks some ads and not others just get uBlock Origin and gets updated to block Youtube ad block prevention regularly.

Just wish it blocked the pop-ups. Otherwise does a great job.

It was working when I first got it, but now it doesn't even block ads. It doesn't work at all anymore on YouTube, there's so many ads now. And yes, it's on. I never turned it off for YouTube. I even reported the ad to the ad blocker website but nothing happened.
-------------------------
block
Works well on most sites. A bit "too good" on some sites, where it ends up blocking crucial elements, but meh, easy enough to disable ABP on those sites when needed.

One annoyance: the default "Show useful notifications" option, lol. The "hey I'm blocking ads and pop ups" windows notification is not useful.
-------------------------
block
It worked perfect! So far, I've used one website, and on that one website, it's blocked over 2000 pop ups! (gocomics .com)

protect
Good free blocker; however, to have protection I would like requires a subscription which, with all the subscription "free" programs, the cost is almost prohibitive.  If I were to pay for a for service ad blocker, I would pay for Ad-Blocker Plus.  It is good but costs too much.  Sorry!

If you install the disable JavaScript extension, whenever a site attempts to shame you for having an ad blocker simply disable JavaScript on that site and show them who is boss!  What are you blocking? Under-taxed Google AdSense revenue?  Why should we reward news sites for being lazy and using thoughtless generic ad networks rife with intrusive ads that spy. Disable JavaScript and all the monkey business stops cold.

Great extension. But when i block element manually and it leads to crash whole page some times is hard to remove last changes. Adding a button to do so, would be nice.

I'd been using this this extension along with ublock for years without an issue, or so I thought. Sometimes ads would slip out here and there, but with ublock's element blocker it wasn't really an issue. 
Until today. Google chrome gave me a popup saying "This extension may be dangerous. "Site blocker" has been disabled becaues it contains malware". It had blocked this extension.
Doing some research, I learned that sometimes extensions have adware in them. 
There was one particular instance that I thought this may apply to. When I applied to a new college this year, some of their pages had ads where you wouldn't normally expect them (for example, financial aid and pages that required personal info like SSN). My other college never had this issue but I thought, 'Maybe this college just runs different, being public and what not'.
Turns out it was because of this adblocker. Since disabling, I have not seen any ads on that college website. 
It makes me wonder how many ads that I've been seeing have specifically been because of this adblocker... Well, my other adblockers work fine so I guess I'l live without this one. I have no idea how well this one worked since it was working in tandem with other adblockers, but the internet still seems to look the same without this one--adless!
-------------------------
block
bro it does not even block ads am the delvolper i will shunt this down and then no won can use it
-------------------------

This is probably then best ad blocker you can get (for free atleast), you can block and unblock websties, you can block elements, you can block targeted stuff, ect. I would recomend it
-------------------------

This doesn't block adds on Facebook videos.
-------------------------

I started noticing youtube videos start with a black screen bc of an ad as you can click skip ad, so this doesnt completely block those stupid ads

It is pretty good but when I was in scratch it blocked the follow button

I had it for over 15 years until it stopped blocking ads on YouTube, then I was recommended UBlock. I've used that ever since.

Websites are annoying and say "Please turn off your ad blocker or pay us money". Otherwise, amazing ad block, 5/5.

just spent $5 to help block ads lets see if this works

I have been using this ad blocker for a while. And though it works amazing for all other sites, it recently started to still block ads but shows a black screen for the duration of the ad anyways for crunchyroll.com. It was the main reason I downloaded the extention.

very usefull extension for blocking ads
-------------------------
block
Been using for years. Five Stars, with one exception: occasionally it lets in ads, and I have to reinstall it, however, sometimes I can find "how to reinstall" and sometimes I cannot find it. Also, a lot of sites I don't normally use now detect that I'm blocking ads, and you have to tell adblocker to allow ads on their sites. I do this for the one article I'm interested in, and then just don't go back there.
-------------------------
block
i liked it its not bad but there is some problems to fix, in some sites javascript ads still exist, the javascript ads looks like the "CONGRATULATIONS YOU WON!" or some poker stuff, and also the adblock should block reddit promotions because it seems annoying to me because i see it everywhere, and ads still showing up in fandom, and some sites using the block adblock script for their scam website, its annoying because who knows the site is filled with ad trackers, and the others? this extension is amazing! now i don't need to see trash ads that shouldn't belong, there should be an adblock for android but for youtube, i know they made an adblock, but its a browser, i wanted that adblock can block games ads and youtube ads (for android)  ads on youtube android is more trasher, so thats why i want adblock for youtube (and games) ads can be blocked without using airplane mode

1st day using my computer i got an avalanche of ads. The day after i got it it was as if ads never existed. If your 5 senses work get  Ad Block Plus NOW!
-------------------------

Great most of the time. Blocks annoying ads on most websites, including video ads on YouTube. Unfortunately, some websites have filters that notice when you are using an ad blocker, and so you have to turn it off to load the site. I'm not sure if there are other ad blockers that can sneak past the filters, so this may or may not be ABP's fault.

Fantastic!  However some websites block me unless I turn-off AdBlocker (white list: eg.Weather.com). I wish there was a similar product for my Fire 10 Tablet.  Currently it runs "Silk" as its browser.  Any ideas from the Gallery..

-------------------------

Used this for a long time without any issues whatsoever. I would have recommended it to everyone.
But then it started blocking everything. Every single site I visited was blocked from opening.
When you can't get to the sites, there isn't a problem with pop ups right?
If your Chrome stops working, turn off Adblock Plus.
I am trying it once more by installing it again.
If it works ok then I'll edit this. If not, then I'll either write a worse one, or edit this to a lower star rating with some more detail.

***edit***
Re-installing worked although everything is noticeably slower.

I can't recommend this enough. It's the first thing I install on every fresh install I do, and the first thing I install in anyone else's computer (with their permission, of course haha). USE ADBLOCK PLUS. I've been using it for years. Recently, more and more web pages started to show a sign that pretty much says "Whitelist us or subscribe to our annoying newsletter. Do that or we won't let you read the article/post". Well, guess what... You can make those stupid things disappear just by using the built-in option that lets you select a new element to block. And straight from the UI, so you have zero need to read any code. USE ADBLOCK PLUS.

Here is the skinny, I have used this app literally, for years and years now. It has been, by far, hands down the best app I have ever used!  After reading through many of the reviews I totally agree with those who say that people who experience issues with this app are also infected with some type of virus or malware. Now is when I must apologize for the star ratting I have posted because truly LOVE this app! All that said and to fault no other than myself I have just spent the last 15 hours repairing my laptop do to some very evil viruses, to winch I can only pray I have conquered...unfortunately I am now feeling less confident about that because I can not seem to get ABP to block all ads on YouTube, witch is the biggest reason I tout on about you to everyone when ever I am forced to endure a video that someone claims I just have to see!  This is usually someone with a mobile phone who has no clue that you even exist. All of this has brought me to whee I am now. Tired and bury eyed I am hoping that my review will catch the attention of someone who can help me get your app up and running like it used to be. This app is invaluable to me. No Exaggeration. I am hoping that it is something very simple I have failed to see/do because I am so exhausted. Like a setting that was changed or needing to reinstall or a updated I missed? IDK where to begin? I have had many issues with viruses and the like over the many years since I first installed ABP and I have never had an issue with this app being effected like this. Although having it turned off has been a sign that I had problems with something nefarious invading my system but for the most part has been very resistant to being compromised and quickly resolved as soon as the problem had been removed. I sur hope someone who knows the best way to resolve my issue here is able and willing to contact me soon? I am not one to wright reviews, I either uninstall an app if I can't get it to work like I want or I put up with it cause it does what I want good enough but never comment either way, Never do I proceed to writing a short novel as I've done here today. This is outta pure desperation as I did leave a message on your site yesterday as soon as the movie length commercials begain appearing on YouTube videos I was trying to view. Exaggerating a bit I hope you don't mind but it's how I feel. Your icon was and is on in my browser and when it originally happened the " allow acceptable add's box " was checked but correcting that didn't help. Also YouTube was listed under sites that I wanted adds allowed on. I'm a no adds person no exceptions unless the site won't let me proceed unless I allow it and only then will I temporally agree to the minimum and only to access the content I am seeking.
-------------------------
block
It was great, blocking 95% but now it blocks nothing, I keep getting so many downloads and pop ups so now I am removing it as it seems to of been hacked.

This used to be good. I loved it for blocking pop ups and youtube ads. Except recently, I've been getting unskippable minute+ long ads in front of my videos, despite having a so-called "ad blocker". If you want something to block ads, go somewhere else

It works well, and I especially love the "block element" feature, which allows you to manually block images (and other elements, like iframes) on any page.  I do have a couple complaints about this feature, however...

1. It would be nice if your personal filters (i.e. the images, etc. you have blocked manually) were synced to your Chrome account.  They are not.  The same items need to be blocked all over again on any new device, despite using the same Chrome account.

2. If personal filters can't be synced, at least make it easier/more automated to save an upload a personal filter list.

3. If you block the wrong element accidentally, it would be nice if it were quick and easy to undo the mistake, without having to go into settings.  For example: an option to see all blocked elements, but have them marked, and be able to click "unblock" on an individual one.

4. It seems this feature is not available at all on the mobile device version of AdBlock.  Would be nice to see that corrected.
-------------------------
block
It blocks ads. Nothing more to say. 10/10.

Did work well but Unfortunately to many sites know now your blocking them ,and asking you to turn it off...you need a better update.

its great at blocking ads but i don't like to it to say how many blocked ads i've got im mean im writing docs and it tell there is hundreds of ads on this app
-------------------------
block
Nice. I will admit I've only been using it a day. I was trying to read a news website and it was full of adverts and auto playing videos. I just got sick of trying to read the news and navigating between all the ads. Ad Blocker told me it has blocked 24 ads on one news page. Great! Sorry if the news site is losing ad revenue but 24 ads on one page for a national news site was just too many to tolerate.
-------------------------
block
Does NOT block ads on Pandora.

2020 Update:
I retried this extension to see if it would fix the errors in YT, maybe it was some sort of issue with Adblock (the original and more efficient ad blocker) slacking off or something. But no, it has the same issue, so I'm re-removing it, as Adblock still does more than ABP ever has.

Also, I find it ridiculous that ABP presented a popup claiming it's blocked 295 ads so far when I haven't used it for more than two videos and this page, and only after I started updating this review. Very misleading and dishonorable, ABP. Shame on you.
-------------------------
block
Using ABP actually works not like other blockers. It lets me block elements unwanted

Doesn't work at most websites, simply doesn't block ads at all

Very good for blocking pop-ups and other advertisements.
Not so good for blocking specific parts of websites, such as videos from a specific YouTuber.
-------------------------
block
Block acceptable ads. They aren't worth it. 
So you've been using ABP for 7 years?! Nice. How many ads have you blocked
-------------------------
block
Absolutely totally worthless. It used to be good - a few years ago. But now, pretty much every major site has adblock blockers. So you go to the site, they put up a screen blocking your view and telling you you can't visit the site until you turn Adblock Plus off.

So what good is an ad blocker that can be so easily blocked!?  It's no good at all. If they don't develop some kind of stealth mode they're gonna be put outta business pretty soon.
-------------------------
block
It even blocks most messages telling you to disable ABP!
-------------------------
block
Used to be great, then they sold out to advertisers. Lets some ads through anyway (advertisers that pay adblock) and allows those obnoxious "Disable your adblock to see this page" popups - ublock blocks those. Been using ABP for over a decade, but I'm done.
-------------------------
block
Blocks popups and notifications, but includes its own!
-------------------------
block
So far, I've been saved so much time, having ads blocked helps hugely, though... the biggest issue for me personally, and possibly the only issue with this extension, is sometimes, even on YouTube, it doesn't allow you to manually block any elements that were leftover from the automatic ad cleanse on the site you're at. This makes it so, ads can get through, and you have literally NOTHING you can do to make the adblock recognize it, and you're stuck having to deal with it. If there is one thing I need this to change on, it is having full control at all times. 

On a side note: I see comments and reviews about this thing being a crypto miner, if there is any solidity to this claim, PLEASE notify me and let me know.

It used to be amazing, but over a month ago, on Chrome/Mac it simply stopped blocking the in-feed Facebook ads, which was one of the main reasons I got the externsion to begin with.  Before, when this happened, it would take just a few days for the various lists and all to catch up with whatever changes that Facebook had done to get around the filters, but this time, no such luck, even after weeks and weeks.  Other sites are fine, and even the sidebar ads on Facebook are properly filtered out.  I was hoping today's update would have fixed that, but alas, not.  Until then, I'm looking around for something that will.

It works, with the exception of sites that are using an 'adblocker wall' which force you to either whitelist or subscribe.  An increasing number of sites are doing this defeating the whole purpose of having an adblocker in the first place.  Developers have stated that it's possible to block these popups very easily, yet they don't, saying that they have chosen some kind of moral high ground (when it is more likely that they have been bribed by publishers to disable the adblock on certain sites.)  Go with one of the other adblock extensions like uBlock that actually work!

This is the only ad blocker that was able to block ads on a math site I was trying to use.

I've been using Adblock for about 10 years, but lately most of the websites I regularly visit detect Adblock and are forcing you to whitelist or disable Adblock to access their site.  It doesn't even matter if you allow unobtrusive ads.  My use for blocking ads is for security reasons, ads are given to you through 3rd party sites embedded in a page.  I used to give Adblock a solid 5 star rating but they have lost my support because they cannot stop a site from forcing all ads upon you!

Time to say Goodbye!  Had it for years, not good any more.  Since that "redesign" for FF Quantum, not user friendly interface, NO MORE AUTO BACKUP.  Had a problem with another extension from the Store (Reader View) which messed up terribly.  Finally able to dump that (couldn't for a long time, many problems).  Then ABP was messed up.  Clicking Options gets FILE NOT FOUND!  But it IS there, I checked.  NO BACKUP for my long personal block list.  Cannot get to it now via Options.  It MUST be saved somewhere in all the various files scattered everywhere on the HD.  Tried Forum.  Took an hour to write DETAILS of what happened.  "Saved" in forum, which DELETED THE ENTIRE!  "Sorry, we don't like spam here."  WHAT?  There were no links, no emojis, nothing but text.  Wrote to email support which gave me nonsense answers and NO HELP.  Could not or WOULD not say how the personal list is SAVED on my computer.  Obviously it MUST be saved SOMEWHERE in SOME FILE!  A tech guy CANNOT TELL ME WHERE????  Have another blocker going now, PITA to have to train that one for the personal blocks, but will not trust APB again.

i have been using this ad blocker for about a year now and when i first downloaded it, it was working amazing it use to block every ad but now it only blocks ads on YouTube and a couple on games and it never blocks ads on crunchyroll anymore   which is really annoying because it shows 3 to 4 ads in every ad break in the video,
-------------------------

Works extremely well! I haven't seen ads in a very long time! Until now sadly. Twitter's new format doesn't let this extension block ads, that's the only problem I've had so far though! Would highly recommend.
I'd just like to request that someone make is so promoted tweets can be blocked again with this so I don't have to manually block them : ))!!

Some sites require functionality of things blocked by ad blocker and it's so easy to think a website is broken rather than elements being blocked by adblocker... Particularly, forms and Javascript based buttons.

We can either turn it off or on by default, but when you turn it off, and activate it on a site by site basis, these don't remain blocked. This is a very poor experience, as you battle with ads (eg. the ones that open in new tab) to see content every time you visit the website - of course, it's easy to forget about ad blocker and it is a hassle of loading a site, blocking ads, refreshing the site and remembering not to open any links in a new tab as you'll then have to wait for it to load and add the site to the ad blocker. Until the tab is closed or you leave the website... Then you have to start again.

You use 2x the data doing this. It makes the extension pointless and I have to uninstall it as a result.

This doesn't block every ad, there are much better adblocker out there like Ublock Origin

Isn't pop-up blocking pretty much a default (either as simply built-in, or as setting that may be on or off by default) in pretty much any decent browser (including some fringe browsers, desktop or mobile and even most text browsers - I'm betting at least ELinks probably has even option for this - Links, Links 2, eww (actually not text-only, it's a browser for eMacs, which can be ran in terminal as well as GUI window), w3m (which also has an eMacs front end that also shows images, even though w3m is basically a text browser - but it has ability to show images with colored block characters, if enabled. How many pixels one character is in width and height can be set, because using one character per pixel would easily fill the whole terminal even with small image - so far I prefer w3m in eMacs, although apparently eww is written in pure eLisp and is thus native eMacs application; people need to understand that comparing eMacs with other "editors" and "IDE's" is that it may be the main use of eMacs, but it's really an all-capable OS within an OS), they all probably have pop-up blocking either by default or as an option.

I'm pretty certain Chrome and Chromium has had this for a long time, has it not? I'm not checking right now, but I'm surprised if not. If it had not though, I'm sure the most common ad-block lists already block ad popups anyway, thus leaving only actual purposeful pop-up's (which seem to have been disappeared, as people can do this more user-friendly way by showing so-called "in-page pop-up's", like maybe login window, and because this way the browser doesn't block they log-in window from opening :D ).

Is there something I'm misunderstanding with what you mean by "pop-up blocker"?
-------------------------

It was great until they removed your consent on which sites to block ads. Now everything is blocked and I get no choice regarding those blocks meaning I can't do a lot of things I need to do. Now I have to choose between making money and dealing with ads when I don't want or need to. Would not recommend this adblock.

seemed to work well at first. Now it has bugs such as filter list auto-updating fails more often than not. 
Also the settings/preferences' 1st two checkboxes won't stay checked (sticky) in the settings. if it has bugs initially, how does it ever hope to prevent malware, etc. from cookies, sites and trackers that constantly get smarter at circumventing blockers by the hour.

Does exactly what it says. No more annoying pop-ups, accidental clicks on malware ads and nothing getting in your way of enjoying the internet. It's easy to turn off if a site blocks it or if you want to support someone through ad revenue.

I have never had any problems with it failing to work, or with choice in what sites I choose to block or not.  The number of acceptable ads did skyrocket and I now block them also.

A growing number of websites are actually refusing entry if one uses any ad or tracking blocking software.

Love this but starting on the 14th. it is crashing Chrome daily.   Memory usage goes sky high.  Only solution is to close chrome,  end the task that is a memory hog,  start chrome back up ,   Turn ad block off and back on.   That generally works,  until I close Chrome , and open it up later ,  when it pops up again.   Tried your troubleshooting tips,  have uninstalled and reinstalled twice.  Help.

On Nov. 14th. something happened (I assume an update) and it is literally blocking any pages from continuing to load in chrome. It it literally unusable now. The developers need to go back and fix this issue. As the recent reviews show this is a recent event, not just with me.

There needs to be an update. Adblock is blocking chrome from loading webpages. The temporary solution I've found is to turn it off and back on, which needs to be repeated if you close out of chrome.

It worked like a charm for so long time, but now websites are getting broken by Adblock. I guess it's the webdevelopers who found a way around this block - I tried with three different adblocker (Adblock, AdblockPlus and the Banner Blocker built in Kaspersky Anti Virus) - they all display the same page like it's scrolled all UP (20 centimeters UP ABOVE the screen, so you can't see the top of the content)
Check www.ekstrabladet.dk and see for yourself. Turn Adblock off and see the difference (with ads, sigh)

As of 9/12/2018 this doesnt work anymore. For a long time it's done what it needs to, but since the last couple of updates, it's broken. It kept shutting off for a while now, but now it crashes so frequently like it can only block a couple hundred adds before it just goes kaput. I used to never have issues but with in the last couple of months it seems like a every few days it crashes and I have to reset my browser, closing all my windows I had opened (which arent alot in comparison) Now it's crashing a couple of times in just ONE day.

Fix it, or I'm going to have to use something else.

it does not block all ads, some companies that pays this extension gets their ads shown.

When I block one certain thing, it gets rid of other ones I did not ask it to block. Can't find the filter to remove to undo the block. Adblock won't let you block anything on certain sites.

After so many years of using Ad Block Plus I find myself in need of another similar addon, since it became itself an annoyance (when I find it gulping 450 MB of my RAM, it's not useful anymore...).
I'm using it on a Linux system, but it should not be significant.

P.S. It strangely reports to have blocked 2-3 adds on that simple Google page, the one where you did not yet entered the search phrase.... Really ? I find this report quite dubious !
-------------------------

It blocked nearly all ads but before it was updated, as soon as it was updated  it failed to block some ads

Ad blocking from an established developer that I can trust. 

There are a bunch of Ad Blocker extensions on the Chrome Store, with similar names, descriptions, and icons. I have no idea if those others are trustworthy developers or not. That's why I use Adblock Plus from adblockplus.org.

A regular business news website had got really annoying with its increased ads. And if you visit a shopping website like amazon it will haunt you with the products you viewed.

It was blocking everything up until about 20th may.
Reinstalled the extension as suggested and it worked for about an hour then the ads started filtering through again. :-(
Removed chrome, rebooted, then reinstalled. Still not stopping them.

I emailed developer, as requested, twice, but no response.

Crashing all the time, blocking avarage

is a great add blocker however isn't perfect and some adds get threw occasionally
major downside it blocks some important things you need on certain sites so you need to disable it for that site and as such you cant create an account to remember your settings and web preferences so when ever reformating or getting a new pc/laptop you need to disable on all the sites you need to disable it on again which is quiet annoying
but over all its a great app and has potential of being even better
-------------------------

i like the wording of this rating, "liked it", i did like it, emphasis on past tense, it was a simple add on that blocked most ads automatically and let me manually block anything that made it through, unfortunately even with acceptable ads disabled it has started ignoring previously blocked ads and further, i've noticed the ability to block ads manually has become hidden and more complicated

Why does an ad blocker, by default, not block all ads? That's like installing Windows 10, then having to remove all the bloatware apps.

And Google/Facebook *pay* you to have their ads ran?

Just use uBlock Origin, or for the more technically savvy Pi-Hole and (if you have time) uMatrix. So much better than this current distribution of wealth fail.

I really wanted to give a 5 star to this bad boy. But unfortunately, despite its awesomeness and powerful software to block annoying adds, Adblock Plus forgot an essential feature in their software, the ability to turn off the extension from the extension's icon, which other ad blockers provide. Having so many extensions in the chrome bar, creates the need of easy access to essential features like this. I am disappointed such a powerful software forgot an essential common-sense feature like this.

No longer blocks ads.  Even though I have the check-box for "Allow Acceptable Ads" UNCHECKED, I am now seeing ads all over the net. 

Wouldn't be so bad if the ads weren't annoying animated ones which causes noticeable hiccups/lag in page loading/scrolling performance.  I honestly wouldn't have a problem with static image ads that don't impact my page-loading performance.  But no, they gotta get greedy and allow the ones that are freaking videos. 

When I goto "Block Element" and click on the ad, each and every time I notice the ads are Google based. What I see is: "google_ads_iframe", which to me makes me think Google paidoff/blackmailed/etc ABP to allow their ads no matter what. 

Either Google adjusted the browser to ignore certain rules from ABP, or ABP simply sold-out to Google.  Either way, be aware that ads are getting through with ABP on Chrome now.

This adblocker blocks almost all ads. Advertisers have begun to find a way around adblock plus due to its extreme popularity. Do NOT get adguard plus (there are better adblockers the adguard, and adguard is the only one that needs a paid subscription).However, it is not made to eliminate especially rare varieties of pop-up ads or banner ads. For removing banner ads (not a form of popups), I would recommend the "Removes Taboola" google chrome extension by jon.

At this point with it selling out it's hard to tell whether or not it's working anymore as turning it off and on I still got the same amount of adds on specific websites despite it claiming it blocked 9 ads.
This developer has now been compromised.
-------------------------
block
It has started popping up a 'Hide Targeted Messages' notification that is more annoying than the ads!
The forum said to disable the 'Ad Block warning removal list', but it was already disabled. Enabling it seems to have stopped the notifications for now.
-------------------------
block
Great extention, Any ad blocked successfully, but sometimes I must add some script myself for block some ads.
-------------------------
block
PLEASE make it possible to block the so-called "exit-intention popups." They are extremely annoying.
-------------------------
block
this extension blocks literally no popup ads whilst I used sites like 9anime and kissanime,etc
-------------------------
block
Just re-installed it and it's not blocking anything on YouTube anymore. Only thing I really needed it for.
-------------------------
block
these developers have a separate app that works wonders on youtube, no lag, no silence, no wait, no "where did my music go? Oh i see; the adblocker is "blocking" the ad by muting it .....like i do.....well if i just push the skip ad then..."
you don't even need this one to use it if blocking youtube ad is all you wanna do.
-------------------------
block
wow it actully blockes every ads!!!
-------------------------

AT FIRST IT WAS GREAT BUT NOW IT HAS STOPPED BLOCKING ADDS Y????
-------------------------
block
It actually blocked those annoying hentai/porn ads on Kisekae!

Awesome! Now I can finally work on some characters with my bro-bro next to me without flipping out when I scroll up or down by accident :D

It works for DeviantArt too!~

Edit: Lately it hasn't been working for me. It won't block the porn ads anymore which freaking sucks. Lowering it to 3 stars because of this.
-------------------------
block
It blocks evry thing! 1 star!!!
-------------------------

5/5! No money for youtube because they are blocking ads on gaming channels anyways, so screw them.

Doesnt load third party block list

I rather live with ads than waste half my life waiting for ABP to process sites I ALREADY TOLD IT TO BYPASS!  Am disabling it, not uninstalling yet as I want the list of ads to block that I already put in there.  But at least I won't have to WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT!
-------------------------
block
Only blocks some ads.
-------------------------

THIS IS THE CORRECT VERSION, THERE WAS A VERSION GOING AROUND NOT TOO LONG AGO, IT HAD THE SAME NAME AND LOOK!... BYT THIS IS DEFINTLY THE 1 FOR ME, AS IT STOPS ALL POP UPS!, WHICH IS GREAT.. BUT 1 OR 2 A DAY WOULD BE NICE!, (IF ITS AN OFFER?)...LOL, 10/10 FOR THIS 1.. SERIOUSLY GUYS, THERE ARE LOTS OUT THERE, BUT THEY SIMPLY DONT DO WHAT THIS APP DOES! & THATS TO BLOCK THE ADS!!!.

Seems to prevent Chrome from starting occasionally.  White screen and message "waiting for adblock plus" at the bottom. Required Windows reboot to fix. Works but I have doubts.

Its awesome, but sometimes, does it block? On websites its on, but it has all those banners, and junk

it is getting money by companies for not blocking the ads

WOW! That's what a tool is. I am so happy to have this extension. Specially just blocking obtrusive advertising is what I wanted!

You can support the website makers who put good advertising methods in use WOW!

P.S.: I love adverts and sometimes I find new stuff while I'm browsing. But some are straight off irritating. I have this app then problem is solved!

Terrible. Used to be the go to Ad Blocking solution, but they are sell outs.

They take $ to whitelist certain companies, not to mention the coding causes a lot more overhead than need be.

SELLOUTS!  U Block Origin, the one and only, king of REAL, GRASSROOTS, BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE - ad blocker.

Updated review:
It has become far too bloated or ???  Pages take forever to load, the Chrome status bar very frequently shows "Waiting for extension AdBlock Plus"

It's slowed my browser so much I've had to disable it.  I now see more ads, but at least the pages load more quickly.  The goal of blocking ads was to speed the loading of pages and other benefits, but it's going the other way now.  Ghostery takes care of some of it, but think I'm off to find a new ad-blocker to replace ABP.

==========
Previous review:
5*
Just excellent!  I've been using it for quite a while and it works so well.  The only problem I seem to have is sometimes Chrome says it's waiting on the ABP extension in the status bar.  I'm not sure if something else is causing that or if it's the extension itself.

I'm even nice to the sites and allow the non-intrusive ads but will block the ones that detect ad-blockers.  Here's the deal - play nice or I don't play at all.  (OK, so some eventually get blocked by Ghostery anyway... continue reading.)

This extension in combination with Ghostery takes care of just about everything I need.  Sometimes I've found I have to whitelist sites in ABP to get them to work.  I use Ghostery to block the rest, along with trackers, but it usually needs some tweaking to allow some sites/features to work correctly.
-------------------------
block
It is annoying. Extremely. I don't even care about it blocking ads anymore. I just care about removing this stupid extention
-------------------------
protect
Adblocker Plus was once a wonderful extension known by many. That reputation, from years ago, is why ABP still has good ratings today. Unfortunately, ABP is no longer useful or reputable; they sold out. 

Ad companies now pay ABP to be allowed to bypass this extension. Therefor, you still see ads- ABP just becomes their distributor. On top of this, many sites now have anti-adblocker scripts that cause more disruption to your web browsing than the ads do. Better adblockers can get around this script; ABP will not.

Adblocker Plus is no longer reliable or trustworthy. Try uBlock Origin, or something else instead. To bypass the anti-adblocker scripts and forced whitelisting, you may want to add an additional extension, like uBlock Protection Extension. (I haven't tested uBlock a lot yet, but it has a great rep and seems good so far. It's working on some sites ABP failed miserably with)

The war on intrusive ads is ever-changing. What works today, may be outdated in two months. Adblocker Plus has been dead in the water for about a year now. Never trust them again.
-------------------------
block
new sites constantly added, and even blocks pesky adblock messeges ex: ads are terrible right? upgrade your account and you wont have any more ads from us! (only shown if some sort of  ad-blocking is found by the site) this messege is now removed (at your consent for major sites)

- not compatible with yandex browser in android.
Can you develop it to be more compatible with yandex browser for android ?
- on google chrome its one of the best ad blocking extensions but still lack the ability to stop unwanted popups pages so I use it in combination with poper blocker extension.
Can you develop it to block popups and popunder pages ?
- I still need to use other extentions like adguard or kaspersky total security integrated extention ( anti banner & private browsing ) to be able to block all ads and unwanted popup pages.
Can you develop it and use advantages of these extensions so I can rely only on your extension for blocking ads, popups and popunders ?
-------------------------

i rlly luv it but the thing is that it blocks youtube ads. Now its a good thing but bad for us youtubers....We are barely getting anymoney now. So if u can, can u make it so it doesnt affect us youtubers.

block all the adds!
-------------------------
prevent
I'm no usually one to write reviews but I just wanted to put it out there that after I downloaded this extension, I quite frequently had a virus tab pop up called "pro pc plus" obviously, my virus checker was quick to pick up on it and shut it down, but isn't this kind of extension meant to prevent pop ups like this? Perhaps this is no fault of the developers, but it's pretty scary downloading an extension to find that it's full of malware.
I have uninstalled it since and haven't had that pop up tab come up once so I know it's through this extension, what a shame.
-------------------------

It is Amazingly block the ADS.It is very super App.

yes ABP definitely Blocking autoplay videos & ads
-------------------------
block
It blocks all ads, even the pesky ones on YouTube!!!

as with all ad blockers... it blocks ads and does it well, what it does not do is prevent websites displaying an entire screen banner saying 'you are using ad blocker' preventing me using the website altogether POINTLESS!!

no longer blocks ads it used to, like youtube video ads, facebook ads, even just amazon ads on random pages. whats the point of an adblocker that now lets ads through?

Only blocked the video ads!

I love it but some ads still get through and there is no way to add them to a list to block them to make the program a lot better.
-------------------------
block
Too many sites detect ABP and block all content until you white-list them causing malware to get installed.
-------------------------
block
After a brief stint with uBlock, I'm back to ABP because it does a much better job at blocking elements of a page than uBlock does. The fail part of ABP is it's ability to block pop-ups. uBlock did a much better job and to supplement ABP's element blocking ability, I've had to install a 3rd party extension (Poper Blocker) to do the job ABP keeps choosing not to block. I may need to find a different solution than to use two extension to do the job of what what claims it can do both.
-------------------------
block
it used to block ads now over time the ads have taken over and it doesn't do its job anymore

I switched to OurData for ethical/political reasons (check 'em out) but today, all of a sudden, OurData is no longer blocking disruptive audio ads on Spotify (the free web version).  And neither does Adblock Plus. :(  I'm guessing Spotify has just upped their software tech... the cat and mouse game continues?  Does anyone know of an extension that works to block these awful audio ads?  Spotify even blared an Exxon Mobil ad at me lol.
-------------------------
block
It has always worked, but just noticed today that I am unable to open options. 

Edit:  I disabled and re-enabled and was able to update lists, etc... However, the social buttons are still showing up on the Cheezburger site, even after updating list and theFanboy's Social Blocking List is enabled.
-------------------------
block
I have been using Adblock (generic no plus) for a while, but installed the + version since I had read online that it blocked the great scourge of our time: autoplay videos (as exemplified by Yahoo! "news" videos).    However, if there is a swtich to enable such a wonderful feature, I am unable to find it.   If such things - it is certainly not just the joke news organization known as Yahoo! that does this to us - could be blocked, I would definitely make a nice donation to the cause.

Despite encouragement here, further efforts have revealed that ABP cannot block the torrent of autoplay video foisted on us by outlets such as Yahoo! and CNN.    So perhaps the AB people are in league with the establishment that seems to love doing this to us.   Downgrading the rating for this reason.
-------------------------

It appears to block one add on the new tab everytime. I don't have any service which puts ad on the new tab. Is there a way to know which ad was blocked?
-------------------------
block
Would not block some of the nastiest pop-up ads. Why?
-------------------------
block
This is pretty good and blocks all ads for the most part, however it's far from perfect. I'm not sure if these are things the the developers can fix, but they are minuses against this extension. On certain websites, I find that when Ad Block Plus is on the website won't function properly. For example, On YouTube, if the ad happens to be a YouTube survey, then the video just won't load until Ad Block Plus is off. Another example: DeviantArt. In Notifications and Notes, the links to open the comment chain or note will not work at all until 
Ad Block Plus is off. Those are the only two that I'm aware of, though I'm sure they aren't alone. Another thing, some websites have literally made me redirect to a page telling me to turn Ad Block Plus off until I do so. So Ad Block Plus is 100% useless on those sites. Overall I like it and would recommend it, however these problems can be quite annoying and defeat the purpose to the extension in the first place.

it has stopped blocking as many ads it used to, even youtube is showing ads now

Some sites blocking content to adblock users, I want to ignore this kind of sites on search results. May be this can give you an idea for a new feature :)

Switching to uBlock as it blocks more ads on the Internet. ABP doesn't even block ads on Google Search unlike uBlock! Does ABP get paid by Google?

I wish I had gotten this extension sooner. It's amazing. Webpages now load up so much faster, I don't get any blocking messages from my antivirus software regarding potentially questionable advertisements. It even blocks ads on Facebook, although from time to time they still get through. Don't quote me on this, but I think it even prevents ads from playing on the free version of Spotify. At least it seemed like that the last time I used Spotify. The music would stop, but the ads wouldn't play. I just had to hit play on a song, and I was on my way again.

It's gone downhill recently and is failing to block ads on many common websites.

Hey, Alan! That definitely shouldn't be the case, have you read this post on our forum (https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=21766)? Also be sure to untick "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" in the options; if you want to block all ads.

I'm getting angry now, I've sent this message 4 times already within the last 4 weeks and not one time did I get a response, This WORKS, and it isn't bad, But listen, It's NOT working on YouTube anymore. THEY HAVE FOUND A WAY AROUND IT, But it still blocks banner/box ads along with mid-roll ads, it's just not blocking the ones that appear at the VERY BEGINNING of the video. PLEASE fix this.

It used to be EXCELLENT.  However in the past week the "Block element" option has disappeared from the Chrome extension item.  The ABP settings say it should be there, but even after uninstalling it and reinstalling it, the Block item on the pull-down list has completely disappeared.  Pretty disappointing. I assume it must be a developer update gone wrong?
-------------------------

Blocks most ads, but one thing I wish it had would be Anti-AdWare. I got a worm today from an ad, making me wish that ADP did this. If you implemented this, it would definitely be a 5-star review!

This extension is completely useless on Chrome as even with the non intrusive ads turned off you will still get ad's on sites and even floating banner ad's. Going to give Ad Block a try instead this Ad Block Plus.

It doesn't block ads anymore. and not just the ads on the side of a website, but also pop-ups and sites that redirect you to ads instead of getting to the site you wanted to get to in the first place.

USED to be great but just stopped blocking ads.

I love it, works well & no complaints! Just one suggestion though - for some reason when the little yellow dialogue telling me an ad has been blocked pops up, I kind of ignore it/don't notice it. Sometimes these are popups I actually want to come up and I get confused waiting for something to happen lol.

It would be great to have a few different 'skins'(?) for it!
-------------------------
block
This extension doesn't always work. I quickly realized I was blocking the same ads over and over again.
-------------------------

I have no idea why other people sometimes complain about ABP, except for the CPU usage. But even the Adgaurd extension and uBlock let me down. Someone above said they switched to uBlock Origin and tested it on wowhead.com... well both adguard and ublock failed to block ads on the site, actually when I turned them off the ads were gone. I use adblock plus only know. Little affect on the CPU is a small price to pay for a good adblock, although my AV also blocks some ads & trackers and I have Ghostery which helps too, so it ublock and adguard may have just been incompatible with those add-ons.

does the job but some ads were able to bypass adblock with 30sec-1min+ unskipable ads. sooo annoying plss fix. thx

Although I cannot really tell if it is really blocking ads because I cannot see if they used to be there. It seems to be adding to the number count of ads blocked, but when I disable ad blocker it still has no ads up. It makes me wonder if it is actually blocking the ads. Although I have seen it in action, this app is currently decreasing in popularity therefore I would give it a 3/5
-------------------------

I used this for years, not sure why people are saying it doesn't work for YouTube..

Well made and obviously a lot of work done to block all those ads!

Easily deserves 5 stars.
-------------------------
block
Switched over to uBlock Origin as wowhead.com (awful site and the reason I first installed ABP years ago) fed me ad after ad that I could not block even after selecting the elements. These were consuming enough bandwidth to keep the page constantly reloading and force the stream I was watching to buffer.

I stuck with ABP and recommended it to friends even when they allowed non-intrusive ads, but it seems they are allowing pretty much everything through now from videos to ads that try to serve you (and would have been successful without my AV) malware.  On multiple PCs I have Acceptable Ads turned off and am still shown acceptable and unacceptable ads. 

I'll gladly return to this company and product if they can return to their former main goal of blocking ads.  Really disappointing.

I agree with you but some sits has their own adds not adds that "Adblock Plus" but most adds are blocked but some websites has 30 adds and Adblock Plus blocks like 98% of them. sorry if this makes no scene:(

ABP has really gone downhill. uBlock Origin is much more effective. 

Now that ABP accepts money from a couple large conglomerates (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Taboola) in exchange for being whitelisted, lots of ads just can't be blocked anymore. Just about ALL of the annoying video ads on youtube get through! Not to mention all the tracking happening through cookies, etc.

uBlock Origin is now a much better blocker, and uses significantly less system memory/resources as well.
-------------------------
block
It's good, no doubt, but there's still the occasional add the comes through. This might've been acceptable if Opera or Brave didn't block ads that this can't, but they can soooo... no 5 stars
-------------------------

Doesn't block all video ads, consistently saw video adds on Twitch. And although I never disabled the "unobtrusive" ads feature, if the developers think video advertisements are "unobtrusive" they're so wrong it's not worth using their program anyways.
-------------------------

I still receive pop up ads and ads in general, so no, doesn't block all.

Used it since 2014. Work since 2014. I think I blocked over a million ads till today (Been reinstalling for a few times, the stats were all gone)

It's okay enough at blocking ads, but when you want to disable it for sites, the sites don't recognize that it's disabled, which is probably a good indicator that it's not good at being disabled.
-------------------------

Adblock Plus blocks most ads, which is pretty good, only a few get past. However, Adblock Plus crashes fairly often(about once every week). This might just be a problem for me because of my bad internet, but it's still annoying regardless. If it weren't for the annoyance of crashes, I'd give it 5 stars.

This blocks barely any ads, and gives extra ads. That's not an ad-blocker, that's an ad-giver.

Really good at blocking most ads but it is necessary to use the element blocker and do it manually instead sometimes. Needs to have developers constantly coming up with new ways to combat ads like PHP/javascripts ones, great work overall though can't complain for sure.

You getting paid by Yahoo or something? You don't block ads very well anymore. I'm switching to uBlock until you do what you do again.

Used to block ads, now I don't know what is going on. Too many new tabs with Trojans trying to download
-------------------------
block
Promised ad blocking, but the very next day it instead slows everything down significantly to redirect pages and push it's own ads. When I am on Amazon shopping, for example, it throws adds all over the place to give me comparative prices i do not want, and more importantly, represents a significant invasion of my privacy since it's clearly monitoring everything I am doing in order to target ads.

They should look up the definition of an ad blocker: BLOCK ADS. Who ever heard of ad supporter ad blockers?   

Oh, and contrary to what it says, there is no option to disable the ads, nor is there warning in advance of pushing them. This app needs to be shut down.

See screenshot here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4_9hPPWxAWBZlF1ZDE1eWxqMTA/view?usp=sharing

Blocks ads like it's supposed to. And if it doesn't block an ad for some reason, it has a "Block Element" tool that you can use to block that ad manually, as well as an "Add your own filters" tab in the options menu that makes it possible (with a little bit of html/css knowledge) to silence an irritating page-element for good.

You can even whitelist sites (By clicking the icon and then clicking "enabled on this site" to change to disabled) that you want to support, or sites that usually avoid intrusive advertising, to help them make some profit without degrading your sanity.

Only downside is that its reviews page is full of hate from people who are (probably) paid by advertisers to discredit its wondrous power.

...That, and people who just don't know how to use it.

detect
It is good to stop some ADs but most of the websites have become more advanced that they detect and ask to disable AdBlock, so this extension has to advance beyond their detection now.

ABP used to work flawlessly. Now there's just FAR too many things it lets slide through. It consistently allows new tabs to open which try to install trojans and other malware. Also, it is unable to "block element" effectively in many cases because the website has a zillion redundant ads that will just pop up in their place. I wish ABP had been able to keep up with these things, but they haven't at all.

need to change

block all ads but after a reload of the page the ads come back
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block ads anymore, if anything it allows some very sketchy ones through.
-------------------------
block
This started out as at least decent for me, I've been able to do things a lot faster and I have a horrific internet connection, so having ads playing on YouTube in like 1080p is not at all ideal... Recently, even after telling the ad NOT to allow "non-intrusive" ads and such, I'm CONSTANTLY getting ads on YouTube. Everywhere. Even ones I tell it to block specifically. Most of them are loud, annoying, and do not adjust quality to my connection speed. 

Unfortunately, I'm stuck using this until I find another one I like.
-------------------------
block
Didnt block the pop up ads
-------------------------
block
I love that sites won't let me in because they detect the ad blocker... It must be working! I wish it blocked pop under ads though
-------------------------

Youtube is now blocking Adblock Plus as when you click on a video the screen is black and takes 15 seconds before it starts?
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus works great and can be set to block every ad on websites, however it would be nice if it could also stop websites from redirecting you to there ads without permission. Other than that geat job.
-------------------------
block
I understand that making adblock a business but doing it in the way you have become a successful extension is sad.  You can pay me to not block your ad and we will call it an acceptable ad.  so essentially you are no longer considered adblock you are a pay for ad company.  and i do know that you can disable the feature of acceptable ads.
-------------------------
block
Does what it's supposed to do, block ads, found the setting to disable allowed ads.
only issue I have is on google chrome with this extension enabled, youtube videos has up to a 15 second delay, black screen before it starts. fairly certain that's a blocked ad trying to play before the vid starts. no idea how to fix that.
-------------------------
block
I liked the free trial, Blocking the ads let my games play much better. However, when I tried to purchase the subscription it did not activate. Now my credit card will be charged and I do not have the blocker anymore.
-------------------------
block
It blocks some Ads but still misses many of them and Chrome ends up opening numerous tabs or windows. Not what is expected from this Extension
-------------------------
block
It blocks maybe one in twenty adds.  It's possible to change it so it works.  Got to go to optional settings and un-check "allow some ads".  Adblock has given in to advertisers and decided to stop blocking to increase it's own revenue.  Unclicking it makes it work as intended.
-------------------------
block
At first it worked well and I rarely saw any ads... I've been using it for a couple months now and it no longer blocks ads at all
-------------------------
block
Can't tell it to block ads that it misses.

It worked well for the first couple years I used it. Has started letting through some ads that create separate browser instances. Blocks most of the small annoying ads on youtube and webpages.

Blocks every ad! :)
-------------------------
block
been a longtime user of Adblock Plus and its Element Hiding Helper, but especially over the past couple of years it has become pretty useless.

the reason? site developers are more savvy and, whereas before if I chose an element in the HTML and blocked it, well now, developers run PHP/javascripts that rotate or substitute content within that <div> or element, so the AdBlock works only for the moment you are on that page. if you reload the page or come back to it, boom, a new ad is there and a new element has taken its place.

meaning that advertisers are more sophisticated than the Adblock developers. seems to me Adblock had a good thing but then just decided to let it ride without keeping up-to-date with what advertisers (many of them lowlife advertisers) would come up with to try to get around the block.

Adblock is now old news. i'm looking for something better, one that will not be outfoxed by PHP or javascripts that rotate ad content on every page load and which are impossible to isolate and block using Adblock's filters -- even ones that i custom-write.

This was a great addon originally, but it hasn't been working well for me lately. I've had multiple instances of it blocking site functionality, especially on Tumblr (hiding the reblog/like/follow buttons in some layouts, for example), and it never worked on in-video ads on Youtube, that I can recall. I have a different addon called Magic Actions for YouTube that knocked those ads right out, and has a ton of other good features besides. I've also had ABP do weird things like periodically, on a random Youtube vid, continue counting up ads on the ABP badge through the duration of the video, to a ludicrous level (a recent one was at about 4500 on the badge by the time the video ended). A similar bug happens on Tumblr from time to time, where I'm reblogging something and adding my own comments, and the badge ticks up for every single keystroke. But anyway, I'm switching to UBlock Origin at a friend's suggestion, because this is ridiculous.
-------------------------
block
I've never had a problem with it and I've used it for years, but it allows some non-malicious ads through. Most ads are blocked though.
-------------------------

it dose not block all ads,and sometimes it does not block all ads

It has blocked the ads. That's great. But my computer is now moving like a snail. 
Anyone know if this linked and how to fix it?

It's gone from being a dream to not being worth having at all since it's not blocking ALL ads. Some ads have gone as far as having to have to close my whole browser.

it misses most ads and you cannot chose to permanently block an ad that it has missed.
you are far better off to chose most any other ad blockers.

block
They used to block adds but now their "acceptable adds" are just as bad as what they used to block
-------------------------
block
This extension is called "AdBlock" not "Were gonna block some except the ones that pay us well Block" You used to be good but now you're a traitor to your own cause. Shame on you.
-------------------------
block
It used to block all of the ads and now it blocks nearly none of them. I get the non-obtrusive ads thing but do they consider ALL the ads to be non-obtrusive now?
-------------------------
block
it is a good adblocker for about 2-3 months, then it stops working for about 2 weeks or less and then it starts working again, but i is extremely annoying and i dont know why it does that but if it ever happens to you then download adblock as a backup, they both block the same ads but adblock is a little bit harder to work, not adblock plus.
-------------------------
block
Very good all-around blocker. Saves loading time, gets rid of obnoxious ads, if you're unfortunate enough to get a small piece of adware virus that is tricky to remove without reinstalling windows, this blocks it out. Trouble is theres a few sites that I want to support, but don't want certain obtrusive ads.

It'd really benefit from a reverse-block mode where you can enable certain ads on a page, while blocking others.
But I don't know how much more code that would entail. For that matter, how great would it be to simply block the visual part of the ad; have it where it registers the ad being displayed but doesn't show it visually ----websites still get paid for whatever miniscule pennies an ad is worth, but it simply doesn't show up. Some kinda ghost mode of sorts.

I tried Adblock Plus because of their advertised Facebook functions, but I still see Suggested Ads in my stream. Also, the ability to custom block ads doesn't work as well as regular AdBlock which allows me to expand with the selected element to make sure that I am removing everything that I want to remove.
-------------------------
block
it used to work really well  but now its barely blocking anything. i get constant popups again and i also see ads constantly. even the ones ive blocked before. so frustrated.
-------------------------
block
Well there's no point in using this ad blocker. It's a complete sell out, and most ads are not blocked anymore. Do not get this.
-------------------------
block
These guys sure got greedy... Change the name to SomeAdsBlocked Minus. Now advertisers can pay these money mongers to allow their ad to not be blocked...

blocks a few ads sometimes but not enough worth installing. total waste of time with this crap
-------------------------
block
I have used AdBlocker for years, it was one of the first things I installed on peoples computers along with Chrome after having to reinstall windows cause of peoples poor internet habits. I am now seeing a bunch of ads, I have turned off the non-intrusive ads but still seeing ads on sites. It is a shame cause it used to be the thing I recommended to everyone and told them how to whitelist sites they wanted to give ad revenue to and how to block things that ADP might have missed. Now I have to go look for a better option cause I am not going to allow ADP to make money off advertisers for ads they are supposed to be blocking. Normally I do not rate things or review them, but this reversal of what your company stands for is ludicrous.

This would be like buying a water filter to clean up your water and then the water filter company decided to allow certain chemicals through the filter cause they feel they are safe and are also being paid by the chemical companies to allow the chemicals through their filter. Stupid move ADP.

NONE of these various adblocker extensions are working against youtube now,   youtube/Google got stronger in the us-against-them ads battle. That's what's happening here.
I had been using the original AdBlock for a long time with no ads anywhere, then recently youtube videos would show a 'playback error', which was actually a 30 sec ad.     No ad shown but it was running silently, preventing the video play for 30 seconds.  As of yesterday the AdBlock quit working, period, can't access options or anything

Ads that I have already blocked keep popping up again and again. 
It doesn't permanently block facebook ads.

I am seeing some one star reviews and I am not sure why people are having issues. I have been using this extension for years. You have to configure what blocking list you want to subscribe to, never see ads on the web and it always throws me off when I am on someone else's computer that doesn't have it.

Adblock Plus started to allow some ads through it's system because they weren't making any revenue and so they allowed some ads to pay in order to go through and show up on your browser (Ironic, I know). So Adblock Plus is no longer doing the thing it was meant to do which is to  "Block Ads", making it's entire purpose pointless.

Does not block a lot of ads and now has started to REPLACE ads with their own so they can gain revenue off of content not made by them.

When I first downloaded it, it was blocking all ads. As time went on, I had to figure out how to manually block embedded ads. Now all of a sudden, YouTube ads aren't blocked anymore. On top of that, many people are unhappy with the acceptable ads program. 

I would probably switch to uBlock origin, as it actually seems to block YouTube ads properly.
-------------------------

It worked really well for the first couple of months but today it's stopped blocking ads. I'm disappointed.

I added this extension to block ads, not change them to whatever is "approved" by the developers. Come on, guys, seriously? You're defeating the whole point. I'm downloading uBlock Origin.

They're now allowing ads. Or rather, inserting them. Defeats the whole purpose. Blocked.

Ad Block Plus is now now only letting advertisers pay them to whitelist some ads, but is now letting advertisers pay them to put their own ads on websites INSTEAD of what you would normally see on that website.

you would think it blocks ads... and it does, however  it blocks other ad's and replaces them with ones that pay Adblock Plus

AdBlock plus now sells "acceptable ads" which are allowed to circumvent their blocking process. Hard pass

they now sell 'acceptable' ads to replace those it used to block.  Time to block them and get a new solution.

I don't really see any problems with this, I never really noticed it adding its own ads. Recently it stopped blocking some ads, but I changed one option and that was fixed instantly. Oh and btw, you can think I'm a bot all you want, but I'm not.

The epitome of a wolf in sheep's clothing. The name implies ad blocking, but it actually serves you their ads they deem safe. This either needs to be renamed to "We block ads except the ones we want to show you Plus" or taken off the Chrome web store.

Called "Adblock", built a userbase by blocking ads, now seeking to monetize by holding ads hostage, hurting both unsuspecting consumers AND the people relying on the ads for income.

Stopped effectively blocking ads, despite multiple up to date filters. Not the only game in town, switched to one that worked (or rather hasn't been bought off yet).

Adblock Plus now has their own ad network, making this extension totally useless. You use adblock to block ads, not let through ones that are making Adblock Plus money...
-------------------------
block
I used it for years and it was fine, but their selling of ad-space has pushed me to alternatives.

Adblock Plus does not block all ads, but replaces many with what they deem "safe" ads. While it would be fine if they were going to the site owner, ADBLOCK PLUS PROFITS OFF OF THE ADS THAT THEY USE TO REPLACE ADS ON OTHER SITES, WHICH IS HARMFUL TO BOTH THE CONSUMER AND SITE OWNER.
-------------------------
block
I have used Adblock Plus in the past and have found the performance to be average at best. The problem is that recently it has taken away the entire purpose of using it - blocking ads!

I want to be able to have an experience of the internet without intrusive ads but rather than removing them, ABP replaces them with its own. 

Not only does Ublock Origin have better performance but it also actually removes ads rather than just adding more.
-------------------------
block
Ads infected my computer with malware in the past, so I stick with adblockers to keep my web-browsing experience secure. Browsing the web without adblockers is like having sex without condoms.

Adblock Plus just started inserting its own ads into your browser instead of blocking them. They claim that these ads are safe, but compromised ad distributors have also made that claim in the past. Download ublock origin if you want a real adblocker.
-------------------------
block
Installed this extension because I wanted to block ads.  I figured an extension called AD BLOCK would block ads. 

However, it turns out this extension does not block ads; it actually displays ads.  They are paid by advertisers to show you certain ads which is a HUGE conflict of interest and completely and utterly ruins any trust in the company.

You can opt out of the paid ads, but if the company REALLY cared about their users, they would turn this off by default and let you opt in to it.  Instead, their plan is to take advantage of people unaware of the opt out.   Unethical business practice that is only allowed because they met the minimum legal requirements by hiding an opt out button in the settings.  

Ads and ad servers can be compromised and even if a website is trustworthy, ads on their page are out of their control and can compromise your computer security, give you viruses, steal your passwords, etc.  This extension used to be a strong line of computer security because it helped prevent this.  Now they give you adds and no matter how sure they are that the ads are safe, there is always the possibility that they will be hacked and start sending you viruses.  This new change will 100% negatively impact your computer security.

Without this extension the web pages are just so cluttered and annoying that reading and focusing is quite difficult. Ads are one thing but when a web site is over 99% ads it becomes ridiculous trying to read content. This extension restores sanity to web pages.
In summary, it blocks popups, it thins out ads on a large scale. If you can make a donation make one. Remember if a million people give just 1 buck then these guys will be able to continue their efforts. The web would be unthinkable without this extension.

The people who says it doesn't work 100% of the time, or it only works 90% of the time, dont know how to use this plugin.

As far as the world gets more acquainted with ABP, the auto-block goes to space ): 
Lately I have been experiencing a lot of navigation with ads all over the place (even unchecking the "allow non-invasive ads" box) 
So, I end up mainly using the extension interface to block the ads manually rather than navigating without having this trouble. 

So, from having a great experience with adblock plus to what I am experiencing now, I'm leaving you 3 stars, despite I'd see as more fit if I could give only 2,5 stars.
-------------------------
block
Great adblocker. Blocks all ads on the web.
-------------------------
block
This doesn't actually block every add. It's a scam.
-------------------------
block
Advertising is HUGE money. Adblocker (ABP) was the 1st, and is the biggest ad blocker.
It is true that they have started allowing some static ads (but you can change your settings so it blocks ALL ads).
However, please consider 2 things:
1. Some really good free sites rely on ads to survive. If all ads were blocked on all sites then we would lose loads of great sites on the internet, because they can't cover their costs.

2. It may be smart of ABP to 'work with' websites, and allow them a few small static adverts  (that are non-intrusive). If they always block everything, then sites will just continue to hire programmers/ hackers to block anyone from viewing their content if they use adblockers. E.G. Many sites have already started fighting back against ABP by developing software that DETECTS if you are using ABP, and won't let you view content unless you disable it.
THEN...
There are 2 solutions:

1. Add Anti Adblocker Killer to ABP filter.
OR.
2. You can pause it briefly on that page, then click on what you want to view, then turn ABP back on. You can then view the content after the 1st ad pops up, but there won't be any more ads again. 
(E.G. Some Movie sites that bombard you with hundreds of ads, now say 'disable Adblocker to continue' - So, just pause ABP, click on film, then un-pause ABP. - You will see the 1st advert, but ABP will stop all the other ads once un-paused, and the site thinks it's turned off permanently. (SO NO NEED TO ADD ANTI AB KILLER if you are having trouble doing so. 
N>B:
-Solution 1. is best.
-Solution 2. is for people with basic IT skills, that don't like adjusting the extension's subscription filters.

Personally, I can live with 1, maybe 2 small ads on a free site if it let's the website survive.
Also, I rather ABP 'WORKED WITH" sites to limit ads so that it's reasonable; Otherwise there will be a constant war between the sites /programmers to stop AdBlockers - and we will constantly have to update. 
-------------------------
block
I have switched to Adguard Adblocker and Ublock Origin.
After weeks of frustrating and manually blocking ads I did some research on ABP. Looks like they sold and are allowing advertisers to buy them  off and white list ads. We have no control of it. I will not be using them again.
-------------------------
block
Well, its good to use ABD.
It definitely helps to block all kind of adds while surfing and even tries to block certain malware. But after a month or later, this extension fails to work like earlier and starts behaving very annoyingly.
-------------------------
block
It blocks ads as promised but easily detected and it is automatically active on every site which kind of sucks for content creators.
-------------------------
detect
You will know it is working not only because you stop seeing ads but because some websites will detect it and ask you to pay to read their content.
-------------------------

Very good for blocking unwanted adds. user always have option to unblock adds from the abp icon on the chrome bar.

prevent
My machine was infected with a trojan which prevented the screen closing down, disabled using Malwarebytes free version.

So, it doesn't protect against all malware! Does stop the ad's though.

Adblocker was great and in its day, but most sites nowadays have code to detect if the user has Adblock installed and ends up blocking content. You guys need a way to get around this and make this program usefull again beyond a few sites.
-------------------------
detect
True - some sites are catching up + detect adblocker, then won't let you view their site's content unless you disable Adblocker (ABP).
2 solutions:
1. Add Anti Adblocker Killer to ABP filter.
OR.
2. You can pause it briefly on that page, then click on what you want to view, then turn ABP back on. You can then view the content after the 1st ad pops up, but there won't be any more ads again. 
(E.G. Some Movie sites that bombard you with hundreds of adds, now say 'disable Adblocker to continue' - So, just pause ABP, click on film, then un-pause ABP. - You will see the 1st advert, but ABP will stop all the other ads once un-paused, and the site thinks it's turned off permanently. (SO NO NEED TO ADD ANTI AB KILLER if you are having trouble doing so. 
N>B:
 -Solution 1. is best.
 -Solution 2. is for people with basic IT skills, that don't like adjusting the extension's subscription filters.

The only extension you will ever need to block ads works 100percent
-------------------------

Rated 3 stars, simply because its not working anymore. Lots of ads are getting through it.

EDIT: Okay, i lied a little bit. After unchecking the "allow a few non-intrusive ads" it started blocking most, if not all, the ads that were showing up.
-------------------------
block
Works great, but the user can't see some sites such as National Geographic and nypost.com when AdBlock Plus is on.  ABP needs to be fixed so ads are blocked without a site detecting that they're being blocked.
-------------------------
block
It didnt block adds?
-------------------------
detect
Websites are starting to detect ad blockers and they are disallowing use of the site until the adblocker is disabled. ADP needs to work on some stealth technology.
-------------------------
block
This stopped working recently, which is a pity because it was fantastic until then! I hope for an update in the future, but in the meantime I'm gonna have to switch to a different ad blocker. Also, I miss the Firefox option of being able to right click on something and block it. Great app when it works, but right now, it unfortunately isn't doing a thing.

It did not block any adds and when my computer would go to an add, it would say that it was blocking adds on that website but it really wasn't.
-------------------------
block
Something has changed recently, as ABP is now causing huge responsiveness issues for a period of time after page loading has apparently completed.

On many sites this unresponsiveness lasts for 5-10 seconds, making the extension more intrusive than the ads it is attempting to block.

During this period, the status bar reads:

"Waiting for extension Adblock Plus..."
or
"Processing request.."

For now, the extension is disabled.

After download I have not seen one ad on any website even on youtube and spotify except for things like ad.fly, it needs a way to block those things. Don't listen to the people who say ”it doesn't block certain ads” or ”it replaces ads with their own” because that's all a lie. So far it has blocked 50,933 ads for me.

I've been using this extension for years. I recently got a new laptop so I had to come and reinstall it. I figured I should rate it while I'm at it. Sorry it took so long. So.. 
AdBlock is the most amazing extension I've ever used. I hate the internet without it. 
Imagine walking around town and being bombarded with sales people all up in your face everywhere you turn. That is what the internet is like without adblock. 
For those who say that it is wrong to block ads.. No. What's wrong is what these companies are doing when they pilfer our information and track our activities in a very sneaky and deceptive manner. In fact that's putting it lightly. What they do is simply disgusting. They are intentionally deceptive so that they can get away with selling their product regardless of how invasive their means are - and by the way, their product is us a lot of the time. 
I pay for my internet and I pay for services that I use and I buy stuff online that I will use. Internet marketing is so huge because so many people are allowing themselves/their information and activities to be sold over and over and over again. Imagine this going on in the real world - where you walk around and constantly have people in your face trying to sell you stuff, stalking your every move, watching what you watch, taking notes about what you buy, what interests you, where you live, what pets you have, if you're married, have kids, etc. They step in front of you and block your path or change the way you were headed altogether so that you move toward their store instead and you're headed there before you even know what happened. That's essentially what is happening with internet ads. These companies are picking our pockets, stalking us, and simultaneously collecting every bit of information they can and taking note of every move we make - yet somehow there are people on here defending them and condemning adblock. Have they ever went to AdBlock's website and read anything there? I doubt it. THANK YOU AdBlock people for protecting us by giving us these amazing apps and extensions and also THANK YOU for being transparent and honorable in your business practices. I seriously love you.

My only issue is I need to turn it off then back on and block only the side ads. If I block the video ad,(At least for flash games, haven't tried youtube) It blocks the plugin and says "The Adobe Plugin have stopped working"
-------------------------
block
It works great, and it blocked about 20,000 ads so far.
Only thing I'll say is that it could use an on/off switch.
-------------------------
block
well done! its blocking all the ads.
-------------------------
block
I greatly miss the old-style block elements manually option. The new one makes it very difficult to tweak settings. Way too many websites have targeted "Please don't adblock" rules these days, some of which make the website unusable. The old system would allow me to block the script that performs this, but the new one does not.
-------------------------

please alert before blocking a site.

Next thing needed: youtube ad half-block. It blocks some ads but not all, so it'll block the unskippable ads fur instance and the normally skippable and removable are allowed. of course you could turn it off to be rude to the yebteb community, but i dislike spending 15-45 sec outa 5 min i have of free time to find music (x it by how many vids i fit in) because i love browsing during work days when i have some time. now thinking of it for the non-lazy ppl, just un-block youtube and block certain elements :D

Really classy of you guys to file a ridiculous claim on the word "AdBlock" for Adblock Ultimate extension which sports a much more clean interface without the "Acceptable Ads" nonsense that all of you seem to be going to nowadays. If I get an Ad Blocker, I want it to block ads. Not show me ones that somebody paid to have sponsored. Your extension is worthless. I know I can shut it off, but why shouldn't that be off by default?

We "really" are going to get confused when we are searching for an AD blocker that meets our needs more than AdBlock Plus. I downloaded your terrible extension just long enough to voice my opinion on the matter. Your company is a real work of art. I just wanted to let you all know.

Good riddance. Claiming rights on a name that has become synonymous with ad blocking extensions. Really trying to protect your "Acceptable Ad" revenue, huh?
-------------------------
block
Did not block majority of ads
Even when I tried to select specific ads, it did not take them off. Very annoying
-------------------------
block
It "works" at what you may ask?

well it works as a good way of removing annoying ads..

But it also removes "Good" ads... not i know what you may be thinking, ("what really is a "good" ad, i mean they are only designed to make money right???")

Well for starters if it wasn't for adds hardly ANY websites would get money...
one of the biggest ones would be youtube i'd assume as it rely's on people clicking your video, and perhaps noticing a small ad...
thus funding the HDD-SERVER that is STORING your video.... 

as for a "bad" ad, thats something for example like a graphically disturbing ad, or something like.... "Congrats you just won 100,000$"

In a way, it internet created this problem by forcing some people to make plugins to block it..

but its also thanks to adblock for forcing google to post so meany ads on youtube.
-------------------------
block
I think its great to be able to block annoying ads, but there are websites I wish to support by allowing their ads to show. I cannot add them to the whitelist with this program. I copy/paste the domain into the whitelist tab, click add, and nothing happens. I am removing this, trying another, and will check back here "some time" and see if you guys have fixed this problem.

I can understand why this has 5 stars in some reviews, because it's very good at blocking ads, but remember the ads make websites FREE, and you're cutting off their ability to stay in business. Why dont you just quit going to their website, because soon they won't exist anyway!

@Rilriia Kilurden I wish we all knew how everything works before we could review them. For example, to tell my friend how much I like my new apartment, that it doesn't have a damp problem or it is airy, I perhaps should know what is a Tartan Grid, how the Fenestration structurally interacts with the Miesian parti despite being an afterthought. Given your tone of (relatively) great expertise on matters of advertisements on the Internet, you must have surely understood what this 'amateur' is talking about and also the amount of truth in the words. Yes, it does block ads which cover most of the page i.e. be intrusive. Yes, there are intrusive ads which, on clicking 'x' or 'close', redirect to the respective link being advertised and literally trick us. To end my statement, the review is accurate, helpful and not intellectually grating; your reply is not.
-------------------------
block
You (obviously) have no idea how the Internet actually works, do you?

Viewing ads does not pay the owner of the ads. Clicking or interacting with them does. Hence the term 'pay per click'......... Try learning about what you're reviewing BEFORE you write a review please.

Also, you must have limited browsing online because this app does not block ads that warp or enlarge a page.....

A few years ago I installed ABP on my Windows 7 laptop. It was awesome: I was able to block ads and also websites, which turned out to be ABP's superhero power, in my opinion.

Facebook? Totally blocked! Local newspaper's site that doesn't moderate its comments (a cesspool of racial epithets)? Gone!

Even if I accidentally clicked on a link-shortened URL that led to a site I wanted blocked, it showed me an error page.

When I recently tried out ABP on my Chromebook, it blocked ads. Ho-hum. But if it wasn't an ad, there was no way to tell ABP about the other things I wanted to block.

So, yeah, it does what the name says. But the secret sauce that made me love it is gone.

Great! I would give it 5 stars, but recently I have been seeing banners on some sites that, even when I use the Block Element feature to block them (it allows you to force an ad or banner to be removed by adding it or it's location on the page specifically to the block list), they pop back up instantly. What is unusual is that when they pop back up (when I have not reloaded or refreshed the web page yet) they show up in a different location on the page (the top left area) until I refresh the page and then they are back to where they were originally and unchanged.

I have used this extension for years and have never had issues like this before. I think companies are finding some ways to prevent Adblock-type extensions from doing their job. I figure that this is something that Adblock Plus will fix or figure out how to get around. I hope so at least or I will have to switch to another extension

Needs to have more options like the Firefox version does. Much harder to use than the Firefox version if you're trying to determine which sites/pages should be showing you ads.

Still blocks ads on A LOT of good sites with non-obtrusive ads.

Click the ABP icon in chrome, click options, then select "update now"
When ads are designed, they write them to work around current ad blockers.  Then ad blockers update their software, and the cycle continues.

When ads start getting through, update your blocker.  If all else fails, right click the ad and select "block element".  (note that some ads are written to be incorporated into the site so that blocking the element can remove features of the site)
-------------------------
block
I've noticed it blocks less and less ads as time goes on. When I first downloaded it maybe a year ago, I saw next to no ads. Now there will usually be at least one ad that makes it onto the page. I guess adblock is getting paid by ad companies now.

the lists are published at https://github.com/eladkarako/hosts.eladkarako.com
and I've added a new AdBlock list named "hosts_adblock" which is useful if you don't want to use your computer's HOSTS file, but still want to block all those ads.

it updates few times a week.
direct links:

the "hosts_adblock" list:
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts_adblock.txt

the HOSTS files:
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts0.txt
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts.txt

the plain domain list:
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts_raw.txt

hope you'll find it useful, I've never saw a single ad for 3 years now :))))

While it actually blocked ads, it inserted 2 things I can't do anything about so long as I have it.
It changed my home to "tohotweb.com," which is adware, and "Capricornus," also adware, very similar to Cinema Plus. Fix it, and I will increase the rating.

I've only had this installed a few minutes but it's already blocked a Verizon ad that is on one of my favorite geek products site. It's not that I don't like ads. But this one is a video that starts without warning and then has play/stop and mute controls that don't do anything.
It's not the video that upsets me; it's the noise that startles me.
Now it's mercifully gone.
I'll wait a few days, but I expect to send a donation.

Bad blocking
-------------------------
block
Update: Don't know why, but removing it and installing it again made it work.

It works differently than the one in Firefox, this one does not really work compared to Firefox version. Try the website www.990.ro with this filter both in Firefox and Chromium/Chrome: 
@@||990.ro^$script

It should block the nagging "you have adblock bla bla" script. But it only does that in Firefox.

It's good but It would be great if it blocks new ad approach. They don't pop up, they pop under or open a new tab for the page that you are on and ads will e on the previous page.

Blocks all ads

Blocks everything till now and I visited many different sites. No commercials, no ads, no pop-ups.

HELP! Video ads on www.funimation.com are no longer being blocked... It's annoying when ads on funimation are there, but not youtube. I don't know why this is happening? Funimation's ads used to be blocked just fine a few years ago, but now they haven't been for quite a long time? What's going on? When will this be fixed again?
-------------------------

Learn to build your own adblock filter using their syntax. https://adblockplus.org/en/filters. Once you build your own script you can have the ads blocked on every frequent site you visit. I use funinmation too. And I never see an ad.

Does good job over ublock, though I used before ublock, noticed  many non-english websites with builtin adults ads.

Causes screen tearing, portions of websites are blackened, glitch, appear in wrong places. Sometimes blocks non-ads, and sometimes will allow ads in (especially those pop up "Get Premium!" ones popular on magazine/blog/newspaper sites).

Used it for years with no problem, but now I have started seeing ads in multiple places.

Spent some time doing basic research, found a rabbit hole. In short, ABP has sold out and now accepts money from companies to whitelist their ads, so it's effectively fighting itself and is not working towards the intended purpose of blocking ads in the first place.

Avoid, look for alternatives.
-------------------------

Switch to Ublock Origin, this app doesn't block all ads anymore and the developer is paid to let some through.

Adblock Plus no longer is blocking ads. I started seeing annoying things on the web. I unchecked "allow some non-intrusive ads", but still continue to see crap. The other Adblock extension was able to hide these ads. It looks like they are allowing advertisers to pay and white listing them. I've been their user for almost 10 years. I'll no longer use Adblock Plus anymore.

block every ad that's out there ^-^

This is the fault of the Late Night with Steven Colbert - not ABP - ABP is doing what you wanted, Late Night is trying to circumvent the system with legal and technical control to make *sure* you see their ads, and to make sure they do, they have you disable it (ABP) when they detect it's blocking their ads.

Does not block ads. It is weird that ads shown are for companies I have ordered from in the past 30 days. I never saw a Duluth Trading ad before... Along with a specific lamp I looked at on Lowes.com

No longer blocks ads, They are letting sites pay them to not block ads on their sites. Uninstalling this sell out.

Ironically, the reason I removed it (and reinstalled just to write this) was because it kept popping up an ad for their browser. Get lost ABP! I'll find something else that doesn't DO THE VERY THING YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BLOCK!!!!

There's no possible way anymore to skip over the 5 minute ads on youtube and it's infuriating!!! On your website it says you can block acceptable ads but this still does nothing. It's not Adblock plus anymore, It's just a useless extention.

Well since the original Adblock decided to stop blocking ads for me, I had to find a new and improved software that would continue to do so and this was the answer! So far no complaints as it has worked 100% well for me! Granted, I have a separate ad block for youtube so I do not know if that is related and if it truly does not block youtube ads, but since I am covered, that is all I care about. Thanks for your service!

It was a 5 star app when it did what I needed it to do, block youtube ads. YouTube has changed something because now I get ads all the time, sometimes 2-3 times while watching a 10 min. video.

I don't like  the way you add your own filters, sometimes you can't click on the ad you want to block nor find its URL to add it manually.

with the recent updates to chrome this extension makes any media heavy site run slow and temporarily freeze.

I love this extenuation it does an awesome job at blocking the video ads that kept making my watching of anime slow and choppy.

Yeah, it blocks all the ads.

It's nice for blocking out intrusive ads, but doesn't stop scripted popups or some Flash embeds from playing.  It also slows everything to a crawl on my new computer.  It's actually slightly faster with the extension disabled!

this app actually somehow managed to make my chrome experience worse because it didn't block any adds it actually created more adds. >:( don't get this app
-------------------------

This is letting ads through. For being the "plus" version, it sure is worse than the original adblock. Adblock actually blocks all ads, unlike adblock plus.
-------------------------
block
This plugin used to work correctly. Now, it doesn't even block ads half the times I use it. I have non-intrusive advertising disabled, so every ad should be blocked. Oh, and the block element feature barely works correctly, making that another useless feature. Contacted the developers, and they told me to restart chrome and make sure that all of the filters were enabled. That didn't help in fixing the plugin. This just shows how broken the plugin is, and how neglectant the support for it is. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
-------------------------

initially i found this app to be a saviour. blocked all the ads and many website load faster.
But after a week or so, it almost stopped working also ads powered by AdBlocker appeared, thus slowing down the system, finally had to remove it.

This extension is absolutely superb.  I have not had any issues with it.  I got it to just block ads on YouTube, but it blocks ads on tons of other sites.  I will be at a loss if it every stops working...

It worked fine for awhile and has great features but recently has stopped blocking youtube ads which was a major point of the extension. Would certainly rate higher but right now it is only useful on other site which ads generally dont make much of problem.

It did not block ads. Terrible. I used AdBlockPremium until it got banned. Once that was removed, I noticed that AdBlockPlus was letting all the ads show up and I was not even able to manually block them. : / Perhaps it depends on the site you are trying to use, but my experience was very poor.

Brilliant extension.  Gets rid of all the annoying crap ads, leaving only the genuine site content.  Also, if you ever download stuff to install, it blocks those confusing 'Download now!' buttons that try to fool you into thinking *that's* your download, only to fill your computer with spyware. Wouldn't be without it.

I am disappointed that Adblock Plus did not block ads on ABC, CBS or NBC.  It isn't worth crap to me if it doesn't do what it promises.
-------------------------
block
it blocked every ad
-------------------------
block
I personally adore Adblocker.
Free, gets rid of pesky ads, and all that dirty rubbish on sites.
I dislike how most sites say I need to disable Adblocker, to function their site.
Jokes on them. 
Do to my unlimited Intellect of the Internet, I just click a different link and get better Quality videos than what the site that asked me to disable Adblock, were to give me.
Plus, if I find an ad that isn't blocked, I just click on the Adblock button, find the ad on the page, click the ad, boom. Ad is blocked.
-------------------------
block
It blocks every ad: I don't know what garbage people are writing of how it doesn't work; that is, unless you use the two of the Windows series which ABP doesn't work on.

The application gives off viruses which are PUP Optional registry keys. While these viruses are not a big deal and can also be in Microsoft products they can track you and there's no knowing if they can access personal information like bank accounts. Malwarebytes are a good product to remove these. The virus flow will stop if you remove ABP; that's your choice. I don't care if you say I'm straight up wrong; Malwarebytes picked up these viruses and my other downloads are from known publishers (known to Microsoft).

Seriously. You get paid by Google, Microsoft, Taboola, Amazon, etc. to avoid their ads being blocked? Defeats the entire purpose for your users, don't you think??! Bye bye.

not blocking dick
-------------------------

I have used ABP for a long, long time and I have installed it on MANY computers. It isn't horrible but, unfortunately, I think it has lost its way. It now literally sells the ability to bypass its filters to big-shot advertisers such as Google and Microsoft. In my opinion that is unethical, opt-out notwithstanding.

Adblockers should block ads. I put no conditions or exceptions on that statement because none are needed. All ads, all the time, no matter what -- that's what adblockers should do.

The adblocking community has moved on to different tools and continuing users of ABP should consider alternatives.

Not much helpful, does not block the shopping ads

What's with this recent behaviour of giving me popups that say "This site has been known to provide targeted advertising to Adblock Plus  users - would you like to block these - yes/no?" 

Whose idiotic idea was it to distract and annoy the user with a popup to ask them if they want to not be distracted and annoyed?
-------------------------
bypass
Over 300 pay to play companies that pay to bypass the filters. People use this app with the understanding that you're going to remove as many adds as you can, not remove adds for companies that don't pay you.

I saw a friend's computer without Adblock running and realized just how many Ads it blocks for me in comparison. Life would be sadder without it.
-------------------------
block
This actually blocks nearly 100% of ads. What people don't realize is that they have had ad software previously downloaded on their computer. This app cannot of course block those ads. Check your programs and features if you get strange popups or ads.
-------------------------
block
Blocks every add, no YouTube adds, Twitch adds, or anything. Great app <3
-------------------------
block
It worked a little but it only remove 1 or two ads, to block every thing else you have to spend an hour selecting one by one, and only for one site at one time, if you close chrome and open it again the ads aren't blocked anymore!
-------------------------
block
I started using Chrome after using Firefox for about a decade - the Chrome version of ABP doesn't block all ads - I'd say 80%.  On Firefox it blocks nearly every ad - close to 98-99%.

I may have to go back to Firefox.
-------------------------
block
Very handy in stopping 99% of those annoying and nasty adds from popping up. But one con is some sites block you if you use it so that can be annoying.
-------------------------
block
Thank you for sharing your opinion! It has been instrumental in me choosing to use this application as well! All those ads were actually blocking me from checking out when making a purchase! I DID NOT LIKE that at all!
-------------------------
block
Would be nice if it blocked all ads.  I am specifically talking about pop-under ads.  I have seen quite a few lately.

Would also be nice to see what was blocked.
-------------------------
block
Why on Earth doesn't it give me the option to have have adblock disbabled in general, and then only enabled on the sites I choose to enable it on? This is the only acceptable way to use an adblocker.

You made it easy to have it enabled by default, and then disable it on specific sites. Why not the other way also?

I have no interest at all in blocking all ads by default, since there is no need to, since the vast majority of decent sites have nothing but banner ads that aren't a problem.

The ads are what makes the sites able to exist.

Had there been the option to only enable it on sites you choose, I would have given it top rating.

Ads and pop ups still show up, I've tried heaps of extensions to block them and they keep popping up, doesn't matter what website I go on. It's mainly for online shops
-------------------------
block
It works perfectly! It kept adware from attacking every website I visit. (In fact, it blocked a total of about 120 ads at one point. 0_o I mainly got this because of pointless Adware.)
-------------------------
block
Works at blocking almost all ads. The ads that aren't blocked already can be right clicked and blocked manually, and once this is done they will never appear again on your pc. Excellent extension.
-------------------------
block
Too All thoes who said it stopped working reason... Google hates it. They make minor Chrome updates to block ABP constantly.
Reason why it lags is cause they perform updates without you knowing to block this.  It sucks but google relies on revenue from popups and ads places in Youtube(which this blocks and stops). Google hates it with a passion... that is also why ABP was not allowed on the store for about 4 months.

It does work, and it run perfectly fine. Doesnt lag anything at all. If you lag or have problems it is your machine usually from viruses already and crap that has already bogged down your system.

If you get FlashBlock as well and Ghostery too this can solve alot of problems in for you period.

BEST THING EVER. This has made the internet awesome again. I despise advertisements and it blocks them ALL! Even on youtube. Can't say enough about how much I absolutely love adblock.

Dosent block any ads

It's great, but needs work. It blocks around 85% of all ads, while you still need to download other extensions to get the rest. 

Definitely a MUST HAVE extension for every browser.

Easily half the ads on a given page were let through. Trying to manually block an ad typically resulted in the add reappearing on page reload.
-------------------------
prevent
it did not prevent ads from popping up. I still had trouble with random advertisements popping up
-------------------------
block
I thought this was for free? Now we have to pay for it? I'm confused, I tried it, it asked me to donate, or to use on an honor system, but they want me to still pay for it, if I don't, it only blocks half of the adds, does anyone know of a free ad blocker.
-------------------------
block
Was alright at one point but now I get pop-ups everywhere... Especally Click pop-ups... Soo annoying.. Not much of an Ad-Block if it dont block ads?....

Great, it blocks most annoying ads

ABP, apart from a little recent issue of it not working for a few weeks (Working again now), has been very reliable for as long as I've used it. (Looking at a good 12+ months). On a few occasions a couple of ads have made it past ABP, but those from experience have not been anything outright annoying like Video Ads that play automatically. And being a Heavy Youtube User for Music, ABP has not yet let me down with blocking those pesky 3min long ads that you can't skip, or any of their ads for that matter, taking me straight to the video itself. Understandable that some may get through from Bribes, as the creators probably put in a bit of effort into this and need some kind of reward for their work which is deserved. So long as this blocks 95% of ads, I know i'll be using this till its final update!
-------------------------
block
Blocked my ads :)
-------------------------
block
It blocks ads effectively without negative effects on your computer (as far as I can tell) but it does have a few times where ads do appear and the annoying blocked ad count (That can be disabled, but still).
I'd highly recommend for anyone who doesn't want ads on youtube or anything else, for a very cheap price.

Recently adblock plus has started taking payments from some companies to allow their ads to bypass the filter and display anyway. Check under the options for "Allow some non-intrusive advertising." Non-intrusive in this case means "paid us bribe money." I am switching to a different ad blocker extension that isn't violating its mission. it used to work beautifully... but lately its allowing ads TO APPEAR all over. BUT OF COURSE THEY'LL JUST SAY ITS AN ISSUE WITH YOUR COMPUTER.

Works great, I get on other peoples browsers and keep wondering why there is so much junk on their webpages, then I realize it's because all of those ads are blocked on my browser.

Just have to remember some sites will force you to turn it off in order to view content, but that is no problem because you can simply pause it or always allow for that site.

This extension seems to block most annoying ads. However, it also brings my browser to a grinding halt at times. I see a message in the status bar saying "Waiting for AdBlock". Ugh. Even on a blank "about" page it takes forever to load. So I'm going to uninstall for now.

It blocks the ad, but most of the websites are forcing to disable it. Else not able to surf the particular website. Too bad.

yes you can have your ads not blocked by them this is for bad ads not all but you can have all ads blocked if you just go to settings and adblock plus is wayyyyyy better than adblock so..... i rest my case

it is not the best program i have seen it dose not block more things than it should

Adblock Plus is amazing and I recommend it to everyone. It completely blocked all ads and pop-ups. I accidently clicked something that gave me a lot of pop-ups all the time, but adblock blocks it. Also in youtube, it is great to skip all the ads.
-------------------------

I remember when adblock actually blocked ads, now I get popups much often than I did without it. At first installation it seems like a perfect extension but all you get afterwards is an year's worth of ads. Also, it slows down my chrome.

Works well, but not perfect. It can block needed page elements.  For instance, the links generator of the Slickpic web site is blocked (gives you a link to your photo or album that you can insert in an email or another web page).  The windows that present the links do not appear.

This is my first day using this app but it is restoring my sanity.  My chrome page started playing video commercials at the bottom. I didn't know they were there at first but I could hear them load. The Adblock Plus app blocked them all, even removed requested to visit other games, I didn't even realize these were adds. It removed the stalker adds on the right side as well, I'd visit a shopping site and it would  give me adds of what I viewed (spoiling the gift surprise for my sis who uses my computer).  I tried removing history and cookies but that did not stop it. This app blocks & Goes Above and beyond what I expected!

May have been slower than "Adblock", and seems to block the same content. I went back with "Adblock" because it seemed more performant.

It works marvelously, blocking all of the ads on any website.
However, it seems to have a bug or something. It's doing a rather annoying "on again, off again" sort of thing where it only blocks the ads half the time. I've had to uninstall and re-install because of this several times.

Normally good, however the past 6 months sites have started to outsmart it, I think.  Most have a delay and then a popup appears in the middle of the screen to subscribe, share, whatever.  You have to click them away.  This happens on most modern sites now and it's really annoying.  ABP does not block popups anymore.

Very hit or miss with video ads, just as likely to make the content fail to play as it is to successfully block the ad. Would still be at least 4 stars if it would just fail silently in those situations, but it's the only extension I routinely have to disable because it breaks things.

detect
It seems some Websites have found a way to detect my adblock. They have chosen to tell me, " Disable your adblock before you can view our content". I choose to do without your content, because you use malicious advertisers. 
You see it is not the advertisements I am trying to avoid. 
It is the dirty aggressive advertisers you allow to harass innocent people with malware, in your face popups, and filth most browsers try to avoid.
Unless you can certify all of your sponsors, I will keep my adblock, thank you.
-------------------------

It still does not block the ad boxes, it only makes the ads blank! Is there a way around this?

Absolutely Awesome. Just one problem. Some website can detect the adblock and tell me to disable it. Please fix this
-------------------------

If you get an add at the bottom of a web page when you have this extension enabled then it means another extension is adding an advert. In my case it was RSS Live Links. 

The reason it is visible only when Adblock is installed is that Adblock blocks most of the advert, but some text still gets through. Otherwise the advert hides itself from some pages to not appear too obvious.
-------------------------
block
Ironic that an extension to block ads has resorted to spamming me with their own ads. ABP use to be the most powerful app in my extension arsenal. Now they have sold out and are spamming my browser with their ads. Removed ABP and I will look elsewhere. Install this extension at your own risk!

It's cool! It even blocked the ad on my South Park video,Youtube and even those annoying Pop up!

So disable it on the site you want to support

Works pretty well but really needs to block those annoying useless autoplay videos that are popping up everywhere! Pretty light too but due to the way advertisers work they are constantly finding ways around this! The updates however are pretty rapid when they do get around it!
-------------------------

Hasn't blocked a single youtube video ad. Not one. Who is this actually working for? It says it doesn't block "unobtrusive" ads.. come on, all ads are obtrusive unless I don't see them.
-------------------------
block
A must have for any internet users. I recommend it for older internet users as a way to reduce the number of ways they can get a virus, see scams, etc. For me, it has saved me many hours on Youtube, as I already see enough unskippable ads on TV. 

Sometimes I see a few Facebook ads that are partially blocked. You may have to update the subscription lists manually sometimes. (A quick way to get to that is to right click on the stop sign icon and click Options.) That's really the only negative thing I can say about it, and it's a minor one at that.

EDIT: A recent update added a way to block social sharing buttons, which streamlines loading even more for users with a slow connection, and cleans up a little more unnecessary clutter.

Has been working fine, but now it's preventing my pages from opening. Nothing would open, but the internet was fine, and I realized everything was stuck on "Waiting for extension Adblock Plus..." So I disabled the extension and everything opened immediately.

It used to work flawlessly.  Now it no longer seems to work that well. I have to constantly manually block the adds now to sites that I visit each day.

It blocks all ads BUT like LongAli stated it slows the internet connection so bad that it's not even worth having anymore.I used to say 5 stars, now I am truly disappointed.When you'd rather deal with ads and commercials you know it's gotten bad!

For a long time this extension was great but recently it's stopped blocking ads! ): I was hoping there'd be an update or something but there hasn't

It's also really simple to disable it on specific sites where you do want the pop-up
So glad I downloaded this.

For several months, Adblock Plus used to work so well, until one day it just allowed to run all ads. I've restarted both the browser and the extension. I checked; the extension was still on, even checked the box to block all ads. It still runs as if I never installed it in the first place.

blocks all the crap pop-ups that no one likes.

Works gr8.. but sometimes fail to Block Youtube ADz.

works extremely well, had the original extension first for a very long time and then added this one to it, exzcellent! although it doesn't block the new form of ads designed to get past adblocks which are hyperlinks on all kinds of random words and phrases--so annoying but i jus pay attention where i hover lol

It's been working well for an extremely long time, but now all the ads in the last few weeks or so have been getting through even if I block them manually.

It use to do its work, but recently it is not even blocking any ads, I am not sure if it is just a problem with my Adblock, but other then that it is a good app!

After a while you don't even remember what sites looked like with ads. Sometimes needs an update since the fight never ends. Usually fixed in about a day or you can select the elements yourself if you can't wait. Almost blocked 50k ads!

Blocks everything, works fast. Only concern is the loss of revenue from the sites but the new initiative to allow non-intrusive adds seems like the perfect way to regulate overly annoying flashy noisy adds all over every website.

blocks everything but a certain few ads ive seen on new game video on youtube.

compared to "adblock", this thing blocks virtually nothing. I get popup ads all over newspaper sites, etc.

the similar name is confusing people, to be sure... adblock seems far superior in terms of consistently blocking tons of ads.

It used to block ads on facebook and youtube but now I see them. I've hear this ABP has had larger companies pay them off to be able to show ads so now their advertisement no longer matches what they say the provide. =/

I like the adblock plus. But in previous versions, user had a choice of choosing/adding the blocking scripts. Which I couldn't see anywhere. Now this is stopping many required requests, so I had to disable for several websites. Please let me know, if this feature is possible.

For a while it worked well, but it no longer blocks some of the larger ads that I find most annoying. I feel like it is blocking less and less everyday as well.

It worked for the longest time, but then all of a sudden, it stopped. Up until yesterday, adblock had been working, but now, all it does is block the images of adds, and I still get pop-ups. Please update soon, the adds will drive me crazy. I've read reviews, and this is happening to others. What is happening? I've tried reinstalling it, but it does nothing. I am very frustrated now. Please, please, update or fix adblock.

Nice and Simple

Problem is a Lot of websites are making it a pain to try to bypass there ads by making the script for the ad harder to remove or block
-------------------------

Works wonders!  It blocks all of the annoying ads and discretely hides them away.  Webpages are presented as they should be sans the advertising.  It occurred to me how well this extension works when I used a friends' computer which was not running Adblock Plus.  I couldn't believe how many ads this extension blocks!  However, this extension is not perfect.  The only drawback I have found is that it will incorrectly block the basic functionality of certain websites.  This can be easily fixed by adding the site to your "Whitelist".  I gave it five stars because this is one of the essential extensions you should use! I have used this on Opera and Firefox as well.  Works just as well on any browser.
-------------------------
block
it says too many filters can crash your browser and i put on 3 total not additional and it deletes the filters every like few days and i have to put them back on...and not to mention when i have the filters on it's also inconsistent with the blocking and takes up lot of ram space
-------------------------
block
Blocks alot of ads but you still need other extensions as well, if you want to block others.
More and more ads are bypassing this every day, especially on forums & social sites & still showing up.
There's a block element option to try & block the rogue ads, but most places know when you're using it & just reload, rendering the option useless.
Alot of sites are detecting adblock/adblock plus too & wont load unless you disable it first, like itv player & other tv sites.
-------------------------
block
Faster internet connection as several people said. Blocks off most advertisement as promised. BUT, in some websites, although ads were blocked, some managed to slip in form of pop up. Even though I'm using the infamous Popper Blocker.

Before ABP, I was using AdBlock, no problem at all, no pop up as well. This "Plus" would only mean, "plus more problem to handle".

It's a good extension, but I had enough of random/ unpredictable pop ups, I'm going back to AdBlock.

Sorry ABP, it's not that I against your free ad campaign, but your system doesn't work that well. 

3 stars for you guys.
-------------------------

its completely useless. it doesn't block youtube video or adds on any webpage.

Used to be amazing for me, worked flawlessly in the background. In 6 months I had around 20,000 ads blocked or so without having to think about it. An easy 5-star rating, with thoughts of donating to support it (I rarely do that)

Recently, however, the extension seems to periodically 'forget' the  filter list I've selected (EasyList), which then lets all the ads back in - YouTube, Facebook, etc.  The developer reccommends a reinstall, but that hasn't fixed this problem. 

So it still works great when it runs properly, but having to redownload the filter lists twice a day really cuts into the convenience this extension provides. Docked it 2 stars for that.
-------------------------

Speeds up my internet connection by not having to load ads with all the pages. Have only had it a month or 2 now and has blocked over 10,000 ads!

automatically installs another extension called adblockwatch, which highlights random letters on your page and change them into google search results or ads. Bit ironic because the ad block gives you more ads. so bad

The app/extension was working perfectly.  all youtube, facebook, forum, and even pandora adds were blocked.  then this week, all the ads came back... tried uninstalling and reinstalling and still not working right.  IF not for this latest.. 'hiccup' i'd give this 5 stars no hesitation.

At first i was iffy ran the app for about 3 months and it blocked most ads.

This is an inferior product compared to original AD-BLOCK. This doe not automatically block ads on youtube and webpages, you block one and it appears again when you refresh page. AD-Block without the PLUS at the end is what you are looking for

This, at one time, was great. It really does block just about every ad- you dont even see the ones in between moves on words with friends. But. The but in this case is that Adblock Plus has a bug. There are numerous site where if you try to use your "back" button, you find that your history has been filled with one website- The only way to navigate back at this point is to retype your search/address, our open your full history. If you are lucky enough to figure it out early, pressing and holding the back button to open the short list EVERY time you navigate back will stop the repeated duplication, but thats a pain. This is rated at 2.5 stars. It does work great to block ads, but the cost is not worth the benefit. Find another on to use till this one gets fixed.

AdBlock WAS working, really well.  Now it does nothing, pop under ads, pop up adds, little Java ads, Facebook ads, ads EVERYWHERE are not being blocked anymore

it doesn't work as well as it used to. pop ups and randoms tabs have been opening up a lot recently and when i looked at the number of adds it was blocking on the sight it straight up told me it wasn't blocking a single ad. 

i bet they are slowly going to make it worse and then release some premium version that you have to pay for

Didn't do that well. went back to old add block.. this just about allowed everything.

Wonderful tool that has allowed me to be 100% add free ever since I've had it(pop-ups; banners and youtube preface ads) but recently, around 2/18/14 I had noticed more ads appearing that had always been blocked by ABP intruding into the sites I visit (eg. youtube); I suspect that advertising firms have been able to circumvent this application, and I would really like to see that this app be updated (and if possible, regularly) to keep up with the currently unblockable ads of the ever increasing insidiousness of advertisers around the web.

It used to block most of the ads on Hulu, but about 2-3 weeks ago I noticed it is no longer blocking any at all...  Still very useful, but this is so important to save on the bandwidth that I am already limited to using as well as sharing a limited amount of :(

Still great, just not as great as it once was(for me at least)
-------------------------
block
It worked really well when I first downloaded the extension. But, after a couple months I started to notice some of the old ads I wanted to block pop back up. I clicked on my adblock plus icon, and it was blocking 0 ADS! Regardless to say, I am very upset this extension had a time limit.

I loved this extension for the 1 week when it blocked Facebook ads. Then it stopped working ... again. Last time this happened, it took over a month to get the extension to block those ads
-------------------------
block
Now lemme explain why I gave this such a poor rating. #1. It does not block ads on youtube, instead it shows things like "Would you like to see ads like this?" To which I undoubtedly reply no since i got this extension, #2. It's called Ad block plus. I don't really see any difference with this other than its original, #3. I saw their campaign to MAKE adds to show that people can block them, This is AD BLOCK, THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
-------------------------
block
it was great for the first few months i had it. but as of late it has been completely ignoring ads. annoying ads that show up before google results are reappearing. some videos have ads. I keep having to manually block them, but then they show up again later
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus is my favorite extension by far. I love knowing too that I'm using open source software, which is working on a larger scale to make the internet better for users.

For all those wondering, this extension is better than the Chrome extension simply called "Adblock." This one offers some additional flexibility and features, has a cleaner interface, and is the fruit of the original advertisement blocking project (plus it's open source!). "Adblock" on the other hand, is someone trying to take advantage of this project by ripping the open source code, and then begging for donations.

I've had this app for a while. Recently it stopped blocking add about a few days ago. I m not sure if it's my chrome or the app it'self.

Used to find this app so helpful but recently it is not blocking any video ads?

I know a lot of people are complaining about this but i've manually updated it and tried reinstalling the app but it's still not working.

Needs to be sorted out!
-------------------------
block
I must've hit some sort of loyalty cap on this add on, or maxed out my number of ads blocked, because no number of reinstalls or resetting of browser profiles can fix this app's problem. 

It won't block video ads, especially youtube's embedded ads, and that's 80% of the reason I used it. Now it's just a sham extension hiding behind the years of good ratings from when it actually. blocked. ads. 

I've used this extension for years, on pretty much every major browser at one point or another. Incredibly disappointing that they're unable to fix these issues that users have been reporting for months.
-------------------------
block
It was working great. I don't know what happened but it stopped blocking ads.

755,254 Ads blocked by this Noble Prize worthy piece of software. This lifesaver has saved my visual cortex from having to process a gazillion gigabytes of advertisements. I'm in the developers of this software debt. For the newbs, you have to select and download a filter list. I use Easy and Adblock custom. In addition if you view the "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" list, select, copy, and paste it in to "Add your own filters" Chrome will be hitting 88 mph and you'll be seeing some plutonium speeds!
-------------------------
block
Has always worked really well for me, latest update means it has completely stopped blocking anything and is now completely useless.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't seem to block much in Chrome at all - I had to manually select elements to block on each page, and it doesn't cover YouTube in-video ads or the like either, which makes the whole exercise a bit pointless. AdBlock (totally different extension) works much better.
-------------------------
block
"Plus" would suggest this is somewhat better than the original "AdBlock" but it is not.

In fact it is a lot worse. While the original AdBlock is developed by one person who relays entirely on donations and is not making any contracts or what so ever with add companies this here is developed by a company (Eyeo GmbH) which gets a ton of money from add companies and in return puts their adds on a whitelist. Still they are so bold to beg their users for donations (as if they wouldn't make enough money already). They also block news about their marketing scheme in various countries. So with Addblock Plus you just see what they want you to see (including some adds which could afford to pay).

So just use the AdBlock instead and don't support this rip-off.
-------------------------
block
No longer blocks anything..Was the best thing ever. Someone fix this please.

It seems that something changed and it no longer blocks ADs in Chrome. Probably Google's doing if I had to guess by changing something in Chrome. Back to FireFox I go because AD Block Plus still works great on FireFox.

Stopped blocking youtube ads. I almost went deaf since stupid ads seem to be 10x louder than normal content.

[EDIT] Found the problem in my settings:

Every time I disable pepperflash in Chrome ALL the ads come back to youtube, also many vids are broken, taking 5-6 refreshes to play the video (audio sometimes mixes, original + ads on top)

Why do I disable pepperflash you ask? I have a 5.1 surround system set up and disabling pepperflash is the only way to make chrome use all 5.1 channels.

My online life has been a nightmare. I have to chose between listening to online audio as it where in silly laptop speakers or be plague with endless ads and broken vids.

For the love of God, may this piece of info be useful in finding a solution.

I would've rated 5 stars, but AdBlock Plus doesn't really work alone.  I tried it as my only ad blocker, but ads still got through -as well as popups.  But once I got regular AdBlock alongside Plus, the popups and ads stopped.  Wish it would've worked on its own.  Also doesn't block those annoying, bright blue ads on Tumblr.

This worked amazingly until very recently where, like many other reviews say, it has suddenly stopped working, almost entirely. It is now an adblocker that does not block ads.

It worked...until lately. It blocks a lot of ads but not everything. I still get pop-up ads at some sites (the dangerous ones that try to instantly download .exe files to your computer without asking the second the page loads). What irks me most of all is that it does not WHATSOEVER block the annoying ads and commercials on YouTube. I hate that and is why I want an ad blocker!!!! In the past it used to block them entirely but now not at all >:/ I would switch to another app if I found one that blocked the ads on YouTube. I find that 100% intolerable. I LOATHE ads!
-------------------------

does not block many pop-up ads.
-------------------------

It used to block almost every ad but now all the ads I had before installing it are back. I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it but that didn't help. Then I tried updating it but nothing seems to be working. Hopefully they will fix it.
-------------------------
block
With the original ad block not available this new one is limited in blocking almost anything on streaming or gaming browsers.
-------------------------
block
It worked fine until a recent update. Now it barely blocks anything. Youtube ads are back in full force, and I can only ever block one ad element on a site manually before ABP glitches up and refuses to block any more, unless I refresh the page I'm on.

It will not update anymore, and I have tried clearing my cache as well as uninstalling and reinstalling.

Something about the latest updates just refuses to work with ads anymore.

Great but not blocking as much as it used to

No longer blocks YouTube ads for me as of January 25th, 2014. One ad only loaded audio (with a black screen) and then the next loaded completely. Still seems to work on other sites though.

Great, but I'd like to hide the toolbar icon, or at least the live number of blocks. The icon takes up space and the count is too distracting.

For all you saying it no longer works PLEASE READ: simply click on the 'Adblock Plus" icon, click 'options', click 'Add filter subscription', then add your region's 'EasyList'. Now all the annoying ads will be blocked again.

Not only Adblock Plus is not working on all ads of all sites it used to work anymore (plays Youtube pre-roll, plays Twitch.tv pre-roll, etc.), but also it started blocking Facebook's images, making it text-only and impossible to navigate properly. If this is not solved soon, I will leave it be for good and look for another adblocker.

I am writing a review on this because it is an awesome app, but lately it isn't blocking ad pop-ups and I am getting several of them.  Not as many as when I used to use internet explorer, but enough to start to annoy me.  I don't mind ads, but I mind ads that get in the way of what I am doing.  So, it was 5 stars, but decreased to 4 stars.  If it continues without being fixed, then I will sadly delete it, as it will no longer serve its purpose.  Thus, it becomes 0 stars in my mind.

used to be the best, but now it doesn't block any ads

No longer blocks pop-up ads in some sites(including torrent sites). Uses 50+ MB of RAM. Can be replaced by Ghostery. Only offers support for Easy List. Whitelist only option: no blacklist! Too many concessions to vendors, using the "non-intrusive ads" excuse.
-------------------------

I've been using Adblock plus on many sites and many devices over the years now. 

One thing Adblock Plus needs to incorporate is the blocking of pop-unders. It's 2014 and time to get with the program.
-------------------------
block
Would be awesome if a context "Block this ad" function would not refresh the page. Or just add option in the settings to disable refreshing.

Or "Block an ad on this page" would let to select/add several ads at once without refreshing the page.

Now it's quite inconvenient to wait every time for a refresh when there are many ads on the page.
-------------------------
block
It worked for a couple days. Now, the ads aren't blocked anymore.
-------------------------
block
all of a sudden it doesn't seem to block anything, i've used it for years and forgot what adverts do to a page, fix it or i'm changing to something else!
-------------------------
block
It has worked well till this past week (Jan 12-19-14)  Sucks.  I have both Ad Block and Ad Block Plus.  I have to individually block each underlined text.  It makes me want to quit using Chrome and see if IE is better... This seems to have happened when the Internet law case allows for providers to do whatever they want... maybe just a coincidence...
-------------------------
block
Not blocking YouTube ads for me, anymore.
-------------------------
block
Idk what these guys are talking about it's blocking youtube ads like a champ
-------------------------
block
It has ceased to block any ads, now all of those annoying ads continuously create aggravating noise.
-------------------------
block
Blocks the ads on YouTube Users' videos that pay their checks... don't use.
-------------------------
block
Recently, it stopped blocking video ads for me on YouTube though it used to block everything I told it to. Now I have to sit through adverts that are longer than the video that I am trying to watch.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block any ads at all??? I have great luck with it on my OSX, though
-------------------------
block
I like it so far but the the old "non hidden icon" of adblock plus
i mean i don't feel adfree anymore and some websites still produce some ads when i visits them...please block more ads AdBlock Plus...when the updates going released ??
-------------------------
block
i give it a 3 star as adverts still appear on certain web pages/sites, the size of the ad makes manual blocking impossible 98% of the time, why hasn't ABP thought about resolving sabotaged actions from these advertisers?
-------------------------
block
Had to revert to Adblock as this is having trouble  blocking Tabloola, and the block ad function is just plain broken.
-------------------------
block
Works well, but it seems slow and Chrome keeps hanging up on "Waiting for extension Adblock Plus."  Would also be nice to see a list of what ads were blocked instead of just a count.
-------------------------
block
At first, this was a great service. It blocked everything. Lately, though, it's been letting all sorts of things through. I read that these "ads" were paying Adblocker to let them through. What is the point of the service when it comes down to that?
-------------------------
block
I wouldn't want to use the web without ad blocking.
-------------------------
block
Didn't block any ads on youtube, and only some on other sites.
-------------------------
block
To all those complaining about it "not working" or "not allowing you to change what it disables", Adblock Plus operates using block lists, which (obviously) contain lists of sites to block content from, by customizing these lists you can change what it blocks. If it isn't working, then you probably aren't using a very good block list, try finding a different one. Just because ads aren't being blocked doesn't mean the extension is broken, it just means it's not been told to block these ads. I think regular ad block (not plus) ships with a better list by default, so you could try that as well.
-------------------------
block
This App Help Me alot. it blocked all the youtube adds and all other adds.
-------------------------
block
Probably the best extension for GOOGLE.

Without Ad Block Plus I would not browse the internet.

For some reason I recently lost Ad Block from my GOOGLE browser and I got to see how awful and predatory internet advertising can be.
-------------------------
block
AdBlocker used to block ALL popup ads, but now a few are getting through. I heard its because now companies pay AdBlocker to get pass them. Trolls.
-------------------------
block
Just stopped working. Chrome on Vista. I now see all ads. Nothing changed, just stopped. ABP icon still there, just never shows anything blocked. Useless.
-------------------------
block
Very disappointed that Adblock plus no longer blocks youtube ads.

Update: Back to Working Perfect, Turned out to be  problem with Adobe Flash Player Plugin.
-------------------------
block
ABP, the app I downloaded to block ads, DOESNT BLOCK ADS!  I go to various pages on the internet, Youtube included, and suddenly I am seeing ads.

I do some research on it and it turns out that they're taking money from google to let Youtube pre-video ads through.

So we have an adblocker letting ads through!  FAIL.
-------------------------
block
Used to love Adblock Plus  but recently it just isn't working, spending more time reinstalling because support can't do anything about the bugs where ads manage to slip pass the blocks. changing to ad block pro.
-------------------------
block
Totally stopped blocking banner ads and sidebar ads. I added the elements to ABP, which I didn't have to do before, and when I returned to the website the same ads, women with big jiggly boobs and a host of scantily clad women having fun (really. Are you that desperate?) Going back to AdBlock. Sucks because this one *was* superior.
-------------------------
block
It seems to block things for a few days then stops  working on any site.  Right now it's not blocking ads on Facebook, Yahoo, or Youtube, (and pretty much any other site).  Will probably remove if this isn't fixed soon.
-------------------------

such a bad ext. which doesn't block anything.....

Hated it
-------------------------
block
When I downloaded it months ago it worked perfect. Now it doesn't block anything anymore.
-------------------------
detect
It's not working anymore, I'm seeing this weird ads from youtube and anime dub sites now and it says no ads detected...
-------------------------
block
It blocks most adds, but recently stopped blocking adds on youtube. Don't know why.
-------------------------
block
It used to be better I feel, it blocked more of the ads, Youtube got more advertising lately, I'm not particular pleased with that. And the options thing is hard to get so that's a let down as well.
-------------------------
block
I've been using ABP for a few years now.
With the new update its only blocking half of the things it should! So many  ads and pop-ups are getting through. This is really disappointing and I hope they fix this. It worked perfectly before.
-------------------------
block
it block all the ads i hate 
i really hate popups so it works well blocking those too
-------------------------
block
Really helps with browser security. Blocks all other popups that google misses
-------------------------
block
Blocks videos on Youtube. 
At least there are no ads....right?
-------------------------
block
I used it and it didn't even block any ads, I had to use the other one simply named "Adblock" which sems to actually work.
-------------------------
block
I've been using ABP for a few years now and it never sucked as much as it does now. Before the update it blocked 99% of the adds on every single page, even the pop-up ads. I didn't even knew Youtube had so much advertisement till the update of ABP allowed many of those ads to come trough. I'm changing, because I don't like it anymore. It does not longer block anything! I need to instruct the app what to  block and that is annoying.
-------------------------
block
not an ad block anymore. If you show me adds even after I uncheck non intrusive advertising then this extension fails
-------------------------
block
It was good, but from the past few days it has not been blocking any ads.
It says "the web page has not been found".
-------------------------
block
Much less competent at blocking ads.  Updates will cause more ads to get in as they comply with requests from companies.
-------------------------
block
I have changed my opinion of this extension to a 3 star, as of late(could be because of latest update) is has been allowing ads and popups through, Result of which I had to manually add the ads to the blocked filter... fix this asap please.
-------------------------
block
I don't like this product.  It blocks relevant content on websites, not just the ads.  I constantly need to disable it for some websites, which makes it easier to just deal with the ads.
-------------------------
block
It works well, and even blocks the advertisements on YouTube videos. 

However they moved the icon to a less appealing location in the newest update, but it still works.

Also, the number it gives you on how many ads it blocked on a single page is a lie. It claims it blocked 88 advertisements on Google, before I even searched anything.
-------------------------
block
Last few days it stopped working for me and everyone I know. used to be a much needed add on but now it blocks one pop up out of ten... I just started using "add blocker" and things just got back to normal. Going to be giving them money now just hope they don't send me poems.
-------------------------
block
on Chrome, this POS doesn't block anything coming out of solarmovie.so ..it won't block the ads, the pop ups, nothing! -FIX IT-
-------------------------
block
Not blocking ads anymore as of last update.

block
UPDATE: I've reduced this review from 5 to 4 stars in response to devo's decision to move ABP icon out of addressbar and into toolbar. Didn't appreciate devo's snarky response to those who were upset w/ this change either. 

REVIEW: I've used ABP for a long time but never reviewed it and now I want to tell you how well it's been working for me. So how effective has ABP been for me, personally? 

ABP HAS BEEN SO EFFECTIVE   THAT I ONLY RECENTLY LEARNED THAT YOUTUBE shows ADS BEFORE MOST VIDEOS (!!!) - this, when I wanted to show a friend a particular CAT VIDEO and we watched it on her laptop, where she doesn't have an adblocker. And I was SHOCKED to see how much online advertising is out there, and realized just how much ABP has been blocking!!
-------------------------
block
Before a few days ago, I could have no complaints about Adblock Plus... But now it allows the very same Youtube ads it promised to block. Which is the main reason I started using it.
-------------------------
block
I've been using ABP a very long time, and have always been a fan. However, I must give it 1 star due to the newest update. A minor issue I have with it is the movement of the icon from the address bar to the toolbar. Annoying, but still acceptable. What is not acceptable is that the maker has completely ruined the "Block element" feature. I've tried using it at a few different websites, and it does not work. At all. Quite frankly, this is unacceptable.
-------------------------
block
It is good to have an option to block those annoying ads o youtube. Ads on Youtube make me feel like not watching anything.
-------------------------
block
We users don't want to know how much ADs was blocked at current page. We just want it could be usefull. Why put the icon into the Tool bar? Google requested that?
-------------------------
block
It used to have a full 5 stars with me but now AdBlockPlus has just become bad and buggy. I don't mind that they moved the icon to the Menu Bar at all, but what I don't like is that it leaves the frames of ads behind and that you can't block ads manually anymore. But at least the plugin still blocks ads :)
-------------------------
block
It blocks some ads but many still go through. The original Adblock is better IMO.
-------------------------
block
sos does block some
-------------------------
block
not working, I have 3 different ad blocks and none of them work, it's getting ridiculous
-------------------------

Use to bet good but not interested in an ad blocker that dosnt block the pathetic youtube ads.

most of ads need to be blocked manually, also most of the ads are swf ads and this extension cannot block swf ads!!.

Used to work great, but as of yesterday (2013-12-09) it has stopped blocking ads.  Everything is getting through.  I'm not sure what the change was, but something seems to have gone wrong.

Needs the ability to block items on page as well as ads.
-------------------------
block
doesnt block annoying ads on too many sites - even if you create a filter, it doesnt work if you surf on the same website
-------------------------
block
extension worked flawlessly but as of recently has ceased to function, all ads and banners now show and only way to block is by personally making a filterer for every ad you come across.
-------------------------
block
immediately started blocking even on currently opened tabs
-------------------------
block
No longer working, no longer blocking ads in youtube , facebook etc
-------------------------
block
It's not working on the main reason why I installed it: Youtube. The ads are not being blocked anymore! Anyone know how to solve it? With easy filter I can't get the ad properly!
-------------------------
block
Blocked everything for me since 2011, but now it lets about half of the ads through. 

As paranoid as it probably sounds, I have heard that either the developer or Google has started taking payouts from ad companies to give their content a pass. 

Which, if true, would go a long way toward explaing why this program's become a useless pile of junk.

Can I sync my blocked ads to the could?

doesn't block all ads >.> it doesn't block the annoying ads on youtube b4 the vids anymore

it works now with the ads on youtube...idk why ppl are complaining bout it
-------------------------
block
I had to remove it, because it often blocks the Chrome "Back" arrow button.
-------------------------
block
It was actually great, up until last week, when it suddenly stopped working. i uninstalled it and then installed it again and again AND again but it made no difference, even when I added the filter subscription- it would suddenly stop blocking ads that needed to be blocked. It makes its own choices and blocks very rarely when it may want to. A very weird case! It really is a shame because it was AMAZING for months. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars. Please fix it if you can. Thank You. :)
-------------------------
block
It regularly needs to be re-installed. If I don't it stops blocking any ads. This is a problem that needs to be fixed. The filters are also incredibly broken and don't actually block what should be blocked. This is still better than alot of the other options unfortunately.
-------------------------
block
No longer works on YouTube ads, and I'm even seeing ads on other sites that should be blocked. Found out that ABP allows advertisers to pay them to unblock ads.
-------------------------
block
Love this extension... have been so frustrated with offensive ads!  Mine too stopped working and after reading the comments, this is what i did and it worked again... Click the lines at the top right of Chrome... go to Tools... go to Extensions... under AdBlock Plus go to Options... Add filter subscriptions... once in a while these will disappear... just bring it back and it will block the ads again... no big deal... easy to fix...
-------------------------

WONT BLOCK ADS ON YOUTUBE ANYMORE FIX IT PLEASE

doesn't block ads anymore.
the right click to block specific element doesn't work. it asks if you want to block it but never gives you a yes or no button or anything.
also the update button on it doesn't do anything.
bring back ad block. at least it worked.

No option to selects custom ads to block?

I'm going back to Firefox.

YouTube ads aren't being blocked anymore and I haven't done any changes to the extension. Please fix!

It works so well, it sometimes blocks javascript that are needed to run the page.  When that happens, I just turn it off for that page. I wish it had an easy way to whitelist URLs.
-------------------------
block
When it was first installed almost all ads were block , but now that I have had and used it for a couple of months it has stopped blocking any of the ads.
-------------------------
block
its a great app remove ads but sometimes it just does not block all ads ....

i uninstalled it because many people out there live on these ads and even huge companies like google get most of their income from ads so if everyone starts blocking ads then google will ask us to pay money to use or view their content 
like sending an email or watching a video
which will be very bad

NVM got annoyed, installed it again! :P
-------------------------
block
Says it only blocks intrusive ads but does not work anymore.
-------------------------
block
This extension installs a browser hijacker/malware called Toparcade Hits. It is removeable but highly annoying as it highlights certain words with mouse-over ad expansion. It will be installed in your extensions and you also have to uninstall it from your computer in your "uninstall/remove programs" menu. I do not approve of this and would have rather been given the choice to accept it rather than having it come along for the ride. However, once this hijacker is removed, it does what it says and blocks a lot of the newer pop up audio and video ads.
-------------------------
block
Good riddance utube ads! I wonder why google allows this thing when its blocking its own ads
I hope they don't notice

this blocked ad for google but not for youtube...............

This extension worked like a charm for a year or so. Now it blocks nothing... I'm going to remove it soon.
-------------------------

it does not work now. even streaming sites that would pop up a embedded video about why not to use add blocking if you had add block plus enabled it does not do that now and now the adds on said sites pop up and keep playing and switching to other adds and you can not mute them.

worked fine until a few days ago. I work at geek squad at best buy, recently there has been a fake java update ad popping up on streaming sites, adblckc would prevent peoples computers from being hacked, but now people are getting infected like crazy. fix this asap, you claim to block ads, so block them. uninstalled until problem is fixed.
-------------------------
block
Also blocks Facebook ads.
-------------------------
block
Downloaded this app a couple days ago and it hasn't blocked a single ad on anything.
-------------------------
block
I hope it never breaks - I'd be prepared to pay to avoid seeing the adverts this blocks for free...
-------------------------
block
Unfortunately, after being a long-time user, I am thinking about uninstalling this extension. It no longer seems to block any advertisements whatsoever.
-------------------------
block
It doesn't even block stuff anymore, I'm getting all the adverts I used to get without it!
-------------------------
block
It worked for all youtube ads on chrome until yesterday... It has stopped working now. I feel Google has updated their system and blocked all options to by pass their ad's. 

Adblock Plus, would be great to see a new version that can remove ads from youtube.
-------------------------
block
It is not working for. The ads are still  popping up in YouTube videos and in webpages. I have to manually remove the ads using it.Is there someway I can activate it or something to block ads automatically?
-------------------------
block
Not efficiently blocking the ads
-------------------------
block
Used to love this product up till a few weeks ago where now a large number of websites are no longer being blocked. This actually angers me because I had full trust in this app and you sold your users away so to speak.
-------------------------
block
it seems to have stopped blocking adds in the past few days..
-------------------------
block
Great as always 
**BUT FIX THE NEW GLITCH WHERE IT BLOCKS YOUTUBE CHANNEL ART AND PICTURES!
-------------------------
block
It doesn't block all ads, instead it blocks only on pages where the website owner didn't pay them for whitelisting the ads.

A free alternative that actually blocks all ads is Adblock (same name, but unrelated to the company that offers Adblock plus)
-------------------------
block
Blocks almost all the annoying ads on many good websites!
Awesonw!
-------------------------
block
I've used Adblock Plus for a long time however it seems ad companies are proceeding to bypass adblock by making flash based ads. In some cases,  adblock cannot block them. In other cases it blocks half the site. Is there going to be a patch to combat this?
-------------------------
block
Used to work ok blocked most pop ups, but now for every 1 pop up it blocks 3-4 slip through.  Not worth the RAM usage, anymore.
-------------------------
block
had been blocking AdChoices ads, but now there popping up all over the place. And the ability to add them to the filter in right click doesn't show up.
-------------------------
block
No longer blocks advertisements on YouTube. Developers of this plugin also purportedly approached by Google mid-July to be paid off to allow Google ads to go through the filter.

It's time to find an alternative.
-------------------------
block
Was good, but started not blocking all ads anymore.
Very disappointed.
-------------------------
block
For those complaining about its not blocking YouTube ads:  Youtube is owned by Google, which makes Chrome.  Google has been plain about saying that it will not allow features that go against them or their "partners".  So, extensions that work on Safari or Firefox, such as the ability to download videos from Youtube, will not work on Chrome.

Perhaps the developers can update their description to avoid confusion, but users who really want to block Youtube ads or download their videos (which users often encourage users to do) -->the only answer is a browser not owned by the same company as Youtube.  Google has many partnerships and is actively not allowing any Chrome extensions to block partner ads or "features".
-------------------------
block
Stopped blocking the ads
tried updating nothing worked, also uninstalled and re-installed nothing worked...  please fix it...
-------------------------
block
I used to love this, but now it doesn't block youtube ads anymore :(
-------------------------
block
Worked well until recently.

Since last night it blocks a few websites, for example Google Plus is blocked!!
-------------------------
block
Works rather well, but by disabling tracking, websites like Washington Post and Patch do not fully work (WaPO does not load comments when tracking is blocked and Patch does not recognize a successful log in despite using the correct user name and password).
-------------------------
block
Adblock doesn't work for youtube anymore because Google paid the developers of adblock to stop blocking their site.

I don't blame Google. They're paying money for the right to show ads which should be their right to begin with. The ABP creators, however, are hypocritical and thieving. I remember watching all their nonsensical propaganda about "Freeing the web of ads" and asking for donations to support their work.
-------------------------
block
It's begun blocking Google Plus. Have to disable it or else get nothing but a white screen.
-------------------------
block
the first time i used this it worked great but in the last 2 days i had to re-install it and it worked fine but to day i got on and it did nothing  it says its on but no ads are being blocked so i once again have to re install it i dont know what it is that changed on the last 2 days but it should be looked into.
-------------------------
block
This used to be the best ad blocker. I never saw any ads. Now I see ads constantly and I have those stupid videos that play but I can't find them in any windows. The need to change the description because it doesn't block anything anymore.
-------------------------
block
Was great and my favorite service for blocking ads but now its blocking my entire Google+ page and feeds.
-------------------------
block
It worked fantastically! But I say 'worked' because ads have started slipping through because the shameless assholes behind this have sold their souls to Google. I'm only going to be using this for as long as it takes another group to develop an ad blocker that actually blocks all ads, and not just the ads of companies who can't afford to pay them off.
-------------------------
block
it says it blocks all adds but it doesnt work. i still have all of the youtube adds and many annoying ones littering the periphery of other websites.
-------------------------
prevent
This app somehow prevents me from entering an access code to send money from western union, drove me wacky, just saying .
-------------------------
block
Great but apparently they took out the option to show how many ads you've blocked? -_- WHY? WHY?!?!?!
-------------------------
block
Blocks every advert on every website.
-------------------------
block
I was still getting ads, ads that seemed to pop up in places I've never seen before. And this is a new computer, so I'm sure it's clean.

But the ads weren't everywhere, they were definitely removed from youtube, but I saw an ad, and that's why this gets a 2.. Sounds harsh, but not when blocking ads is the only thing this is really used for.
-------------------------
block
I've had it for a few months now and now its stopped working! It said it's added, but I keep looking if there was an upgrade that I could've missed but there's not. I think it just stopped working. If not, there must be a glitch and it needs to be fixed. Or at least update it or something. And when I try to individually block something, it won't let me. Who ever created this needs to update it.
-------------------------
block
useless, never blocked any ads in my browser.
-------------------------
block
Does not block video's on youtube. Total scam and waste of space. Meaning it'll slow down your computer.
-------------------------
block
Like others, this extension stopped working.  All ads are appearing unless you block the div that  they appear in, and that isn't worthwhile.
-------------------------
block
Stopped working? Loved this on Firefox,never a problem, but had to switch to chrome due to flash crashing on every page. Less than a month, now no ads are blocked, and setting up a filter for every ad is not useful. Installing regular adblock and adblock for youtube to see if that helps.
-------------------------
block
It worked for maybe a week and now it isn't blocking anything! It is extremely frustrating, YouTube has tons of stupid adds with audio and they drive me crazy!
-------------------------
block
No longer blocks video ads on youtube, but it stops regular advertisements at least.
-------------------------

Suddenly, about two weeks ago, all adverts, on all websites, started showing... It is not working any more! What's happened? I have been using Adblock Plus for so long, and it worked perfectly, until now. Now, I have to individually block every advert on every website - and it works, but not always.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't always block youtube ads.
-------------------------
block
adblock plus needs a update cause it doesn't block every single ad on youtube like those stupid banner ads on youtube!
-------------------------
block
It's stopped working recently. What good is an ad blocker if it doesn't block ads?
-------------------------
block
I installed adblock to block youtube ads but now youtube still has ads with adblock turned on! Please fix this.
-------------------------
block
When I first installed this it worked like a dream. It would block almost all of the ads on websites and videos. But, recently it isn't blocking anything. It seems as if ads are everywhere. When I try to "add" to the filter, it isn't working correctly and will then block me from the whole page.

Dear all, 

My name is Job Plas, and I am the Project Manager for Adblock Plus. Due to a bug, YouTube video ads have been showing for everyone using an adblocker (not only Adblock Plus).

We're happy to announce that we fixed this, and that Adblock Plus is now the only Chrome extension which blocks all annoying YouTube video ads again!

Happy browsing from the ABP team :) 

Best, 
Job

The ads are not fully blocked. The place holders are still on the site for YouTube.

This addon is perfect. It blocks all kinds of ads and pop-ups window.

But since a few days ads are starting to get through the add-on. I'm disappointed about that, now I have to wait the ad  to be done on YouTube to watch my video or skip the ad. 

I assume the producers of this add-on will fix it anytime soon because this started only like 4-5 days ago.
-------------------------
block
does not block any ads!

It worked great at first, now it's not blocking any ads whatsoever. Please fix this as soon as possible

piece of crud now i've used various ad blocking programs before now but this one this one it really takes the mick i mean really the other ones blocked like what 4 ads then charged this one is free and on GOOGLE and yet can't block a single add not on any site what so ever not on youtube or facebook or anything promised i have used this before but for some reason it got removed now i suggest you fix this extension and any issues you have because this is starting to get stupid.

BLOCK THE YOUTUBE ADS!!

For everyone wondering Java updated and is now able to bypass adblock, its not the extensions fault, they just need to make a new version of it

It was working fine until the other day where it has completely stopped blocking ads?
-------------------------
block
This was the greatest app on Chrome, blocked everything, but suddenly for no apparent reason it completely stopped working, and judging by the other reviews I am not alone in this phenomenon.
-------------------------
block
This extension is infinitely better than the normal "Adblock" version. Both extensions are by entirely different authors, and Adblock Plus allows non-intrusive ads to be shown. This means you can still support websites with ads that aren't bothering your browsing experience and you can block the ones that flash in your face. Please remember that your favourite websites wouldn't still be running today if it wasn't for ads to fund them! Blocking all of the ads hurts you as well as the website.
-------------------------
block
Best add block out there, I tried using a different shotty one before and this is leagues better.

It was so perfect that I suggested it to everybody I know. Now since about 2 weeks, it hasn't been working properly. Doesn't even block the simplest ads any more. What's going on?

Adblock Plus is NOT good. For all of you wanting to know why Adblock Plus is "not working": companies pay Adblock Plus to be whitelisted so they can display ads. Get Adblock. It is run entirely off donations, blocks Youtube ads, and doesn't take payments from companies to whitelist their websites.

Hated this app from the beginning, because it opens a full page tab every time Chrome opens advertising itself.  OMG, it's a pop-up blocker that *IS* a pop-up ad itself!

Functionally, the results are really inconsistent.  Go somewhere else for ad blocking.

I used to really like this extension. It worked BEAUTIFULLY and browsing the internet was awesome. But for the past few weeks, I keep having to reupdate the extension just about every day to block ads, and even doing that will only block them for about an hour.

This day and age I almost refuse to surf without this add-on. However, it works better in Mozilla than it does in Chrome.

ABP used to be a solid program that did exactly what I wanted: blocked all ads on pages I was viewing.

In the last few months more and more ads have been getting through and now I wonder what ABP does any more. It looks like I'm running a program and using system resources for a plugin that does next to nothing.

Come on team: grow some balls and deliver what we actually want!

Blocks ads well enough, but what's really annoying is that I noticed on the Target and Walmart websites I can't click any of the links. None of them. Who knows how many other sites I might find this same problem with. Also, and just as annoying, is clicking the back button on the chrome browser. Most times I have to click it at least twice, but sometimes as much as three or four times before I can go back a page. I know this is due to Adblock Plus because when I disable it and use the old AdBlock I don't have these problems.

Great way to block all those annoying ads and yet still allow some ads on site which you want to support. The internet would be a better place if people didn't abuse the use of ads.

Awsome blocks all adds,

Works fine but turns "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" back on with every @#$&*^ update.  Cut it out! The whole point of this thing is to block all advertising, not just those you (the developer) aren't being paid to allow through. Shameful.

Whats the use of an adblock if it does not block ads?

It worked fine on my old pc, but installed it on my new one and it just does not work.
-------------------------

A must have for anyone using a web browser. Yes some ads do get through if you keep the default extension settings, there is an option to disable this. Also there are blacklist and whitelist options to disallow and allow ads from websites of your choosing. 

I haven't had the problems some other reviewers are experiencing - been using ad block plus for years, first on firefox and now on Chrome.

- A couple of suggestions if you're having problems with this extension
  1. First of all, go into the extension settings and check out what options you have - you should do this with EVERY extension you install.
 2. If you are still getting alot of ads maybe you should run spybot on your PC and check for spyware. Also, in the extension options add a subscription to 'Fanboys' list. I subscribe to 'easylist' and 'fanboys' list and have NO issues.

- Ads keep the web free, which is why the option to allow some non-intrusive ads is default, you can see the list of sites that it allow and disable this feature if you'd like. Some non-intrusive, text based, ads are fine with me; It's the bright, flashing, in your face distracting ads that are the problem.

Hands down a 5 star extension.
-------------------------

The extension itself was a very good one, however after using it for about a month; It no longer feels the need to block anything on any site anymore unless I put directly in the filter. For the month it worked it was great, however no it's just an extension slowing down my browser's speed for it's use even tho it's not doing anything it's supposed to.

I like this app and always install it, however this time around I noticed that it has been interfering with my facebook browsing when it blocks adds because it will just start to constantly say "ad not from this site" over and over and over so I can't view anything because it keeps scrolling me to the top. Like, if I have to scroll down to view my friends comment it'll  keep bumping me back to the top of the page because of the stupid ad block notice. Before it didn't alert me when it blocked ads like that, it just blocked them no questions asked. Let' go back to that.

Hands down one of the best extensions available. Blocks YouTube ads, search ads, dashboard ads, Pandora ads (on and off), ads of literally every single type. The one improvement that could be made is some way to show if a full-page ad has been blocked; it is sometimes unclear whether a large ad is blocked or the page simply fails to load.

annoyed with the youtube ad it blocked it
-------------------------

I got this to block the ads from two specific web sites, not every site.

It would be cool if you could invert it so that you can select sites to block, rather than having to select sites to unblock.

Also it needs to be able to sync between other stuff so that I don't need to remove ads from the same sites on my other computer.

I know the subject of blocking ads can be a touchy subject but the truth is that without an ad blocker some sites can be dangerous, unusable and sometimes offensive without an blocker so I enabled for these types of sites and disable it for sites I wish to support and whose ads aren't offensive. Just a word of warning Google if you try the same trick as what you have done in the Google play store I'll be moving back to Firefox and removing adblockers from play store hasn't stopped me blocking ads on my android device it made me more determined to and downloaded the app from elsewhere , you don't own my android device I DO and I'll use an adblocker on it if I wish to.
-------------------------

It worked as expected when I first downloaded it. But now it's like it's not blocking any ads. Youtube has another video window that pops up OVER the youtube video itself, and then when that's done another ad plays but this time in the youtube video. and in random websites I have ads EVERYWHERE. It's garbage, it does not whatsoever block any type of ad. I am currently using google chrome.
-------------------------
block
While this works well enough much of the time, it has a tendency to forget what filters you've added manually - meaning that, in cases where it doesn't block something that gets around its normal blocking behavior, it is utterly powerless.

An official port of Element Hiding Helper would be extremely useful, but there isn't one, and the one already listed in the store isn't official and may be a trick of some sort.
-------------------------
block
It does its job - it blocks ads on Facebook - but it also prevents you from using the 'Back' button to retrieve your previous page, and instead continues to reload your current page.

On some sites, it creates havoc as the page tries to load causing a flash that will induce epileptic seizures.

I'm using Chrome and Windows 7 - and had to disable Adblock the first day I installed it.
-------------------------

It is great blocks even YouTube ads (Sorry Google)

it worked really well for a while but now it doesn't block any ads at all...i'm quite disappointed.

I find this to be much more sufficient at blocking popups than the stock chrome popup blocker.  That being said a few sites like hulu and youtube (who make money on advertisements) have found ways to discourage the use of this extension.  Hulu will make you sit and wait for 3 minutes with a blank screen instead of their normal 60 second or less commercials.  Youtube's videos will buffer at a slower rate etc.  You can disable the extension for certain sites though so it's still a must have!
-------------------------
block
This is a great extension for Chrome when it comes to blocking ads on every website. However, there is a HUGE problem with this extension. After a week or so with this installed, Youtube videos load a lot slower. So you might want to disable it if you're having trouble loading Youtube videos.

really bad ad blocking

I've had it for about 3 weeks now, It worked wonders when it was in order. Not sure if its going through an update currently, but its starting to mess up on my browser.

They always disappear when I disable it. Reappears when it's enabled again... Other than that, I'm very glad to have it. C:
-------------------------

can't argue that it blocks the ads just iv found that it'l make a page like youtube flicker (sort of) as it tries to take off the banner ad at the top of the page. does the same to facebook and also cannot extend a post (using the see more links) on facebook (though that may be something else)

This sucks, whenever I want to play on something flash, it blocks it.

What's happened to it? It used to work perfectly for me but now it's only blocking ads SOMETIMES. Just what
-------------------------

This extension works great blocking all advertisements! The only thing that I don't like is that my bank will issue a pop up advertisement after I log in, and I cannot get to doing my banking until I disable ABP and reload the page, other then that, no problems!
-------------------------
block
It use to work fine, but now it doesn't block ANY video ads...The ads on the side of the screen are gone, but ever since the update that allowed the option of letting some ads through, none of the video ads are blocked...which was the main reason for me getting this in the first place.

If your internet connection is slow adblocker is good way to speed up by blocking ads.

Great app... but

Blocked content on site i whitelisted, and their forum told me I was spamming on my first and only post (attempt).

Starting November 2012, could not use NFL Fantasy website with this extension. Once the extension was removed, I could use the NFL site.

I want to block ads not content!
-------------------------

I've started to get TONS of advertisement on ALL pages I visit. I'm SICK of it. Adblock claims to be working but this is not true. Adblock is NOT BLOCKING advertisements! THIS IS BROKEN.
-------------------------
block
While I loved Adblock Plus for Firefox, I don't like it for Chrome. I had to recently switch browsers and got Chrome versions of all my addons (or very similar in function equivalents), and I'm not impressed with how this one works. A lot of advertisement went through, if I right-click to block an ad, nothing happens, and nothing gets put into the custom filter. It was honestly a much more reliable addon for firefox and much simpler  there as well.

I switched to the other "Adblock" addon, and I have to say that it does the job I require and it is so much simpler to add custom filters, and it uses all the same filters (EasyList, Fanboy, etc) as this one!
-------------------------
block
The best solution for blocking ads but there is a annoying bug with it. Sometimes it causes the CSS of a website not to load, I'm using the latest version of Chrome - 22.0.1229.96 m
-------------------------
block
Blocks all adds. That's all I need, that's all I want AND IT'S AWSOME
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus blocks ads EXCEPT ITS OWN!  Every time I launch Chrome it opens its own tab and claims "Adblock Plus has been updated"  EVERY time I launch Chrome.  Uninstalled...
-------------------------
block
It does a great job of blocking most ads. Needs to add in the ability to block overlays, and it's Facebook ad blocking is hit and miss.

Also, since updating, I keep getting pop-ups every time I start my browser about how it just updated. I don't care. Stop pestering me. That's why I got this extension...
-------------------------
block
I used this quite happily until the latest upgrade. Now it constantly resets to showing ads and opens a new tab advertising itself every time I open the browser. As it no longer blocks ads, I'll no longer be using it.
-------------------------
block
Every time you open Chrome, a pop up window opens with an ad for Ad Block. The extension is spam, or malware.

Love it, been using this for months with no hitch, everything is blocked. Though the most recent update allows VEVO's background pictures to come through on their Youtube channels.

I've given this three stars because I haven't had a problem until the last update, now it doesn't block ads anywhere. Facebook, YouTube, etc. Even blocking the ads manually doesn't work. Its still a good app, but the update has made it a bit slack.
-------------------------
block
It was good at first but now it's letting ads through on websites like youtube, etc. There isn't much I can do to fix it. I was just on a website and there were TONS of ads that weren't being blocked. The app even said it was enabled for the site. Please try to fix this.
-------------------------
block
Sucks after the update v1.3,it does not blocking ads anymore,the beta one(v1.2)works very well but after the update not working anymore.Plsss FIX this,I really love Adblock Plus
-------------------------
block
ok so this JUST updated and right away its crap on youtube, it brings up a google chrome error saying "This webpage was blocked by an extension.

A third-party extension has blocked access to this webpage." which is almost as annoying as actually seeing the ads.
seems ironic that this is straight out of beta and it has problems
-------------------------
block
Ad block worked great until they recently decided to let some ads through. If I wanted to see ads, I wouldn't use an app for it in the first place. Even after I opted out of only blocking some ads, there are still ads showing that had been blocked previously.
-------------------------
block
Where do I start?

Well for starters, just because you can't see ads doesn't mean it's blocked... If anything this should just be called AdViewBlock. Ads still load companies still get the info they want, your info. 

People say "This is super fast and low cpu", thats because its NOT DOING anything, it's just not letting you see an ad that is STILL THERE.

AdBlock on the other hand actually blocks the ads from loading, sure on some sites it takes - seconds to completely block but its a small price to pay for actual ad free browsing compared to this AdBlock Plus nonsense. 

About 1.5-2.3 million of the people who got AdBlock Plus only clicked/downloaded it because they though the guy who made AdBlock made this; this is NOT the case. I really hate how the name is AdBlock Plus as it implies that it is some upgraded version.

AdBlock:
-Different Developer
-Actually blocks ads not just hide them
-Perfect for anyone and shows high cpu usage on few sites and even then the waiting period is short

AdBlock Plus:
-Does NOT block ads only hides them
-Companies still get your information
-Low cpu usage
-Useful for people who just want to not see ads but not block them
-The name is a pitiful lie

I only give this 2 starts instead of one because it may be more useful for people not looking not block ads, just not view them.

That is my report.


Cheers.

Some bugs and doesn't block surveys, and seams like its not working right now, but when it is, it saves your computer from virus.

It is great compared to "adblock"  the version without plus at the end. This version blocks everything including video commercials.

This is the real Adblock Plus for Chrome. Adblock is completely independent and while competent I personally find it never quite meets the complete standards of Adblock Plus. While not quite as powerful as it's Firefox older brother it gets the job done and also does a flawless job of blocking those annoying YouTube streaming ads. If the occasional text ad happens to slip through (never seen it myself. Have a heart and let them display. Sites need to make their revenue somehow and so long as the ads aren't intrusive (banner, video, flash animation etc) then there's nothing to really complain about.
-------------------------

Pretty good at blocking most websites. However mastertoons has a grudge with ad blocking programs. If I disable adblock, my computer will screw up

It Blocks surveys too.

There's nothing wrong with ads - it's what makes the internet free... but most website designers don't understand good ad placement. I don't mind non-obtrusive ads, so I give something back to those websites by allowing them to serve me ads. But Adblock Plus (Beta) don't have a good interface for blocking single specific ads... only if you know the exact CSS selectors. I prefer AdBlock from chromeadblock
-------------------------
block
Writing as a web developer, I would prefer to see Adblock only blocking intrusive ads (popups, video ads, etc.), at least by default.
-------------------------

Blocks any ads, completely beats Adblock (not Adblock Plus).

Worked great for the longest time, but for the  past month or so, it has quit blocking ads on Facebook.

If only they can also add the 'block this ad' button from the previous  version

Adblock Plus stops the annoying adds, but unfortunately it also blocks some other things. For example, i cannot play balloons Tower Defense 5 with it on.

Instead of blocking or removing ad, it just hides ad, all those ads are still clickable.

I've installed TONS of apps like this that claim to block pesky ads and pop-ups... I can't believe how well this one works!!

And if an ad/popup were to slip by (which is rare) then you just click on their little icon then right-click on the ad and it stores that html info so that it won't interfere again!

ANOTHER BIG PLUS is, it doesn't have any negative effects which I've noticed on hindering the things that matter to you on a site from functioning.. which is usually another problem with these type of apps.  2 Thumbs Up!!

Great job of eliminating ads with few misses, but also blocks images too aggressively at times. Integrated image features on Twitter get blocked, and the ext. refuses to keep the site whitelisted for some reason. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.

It blocks some ads, but it also blocks some games and movies that are not ads.

ABP always worked fine on Firefox, but there is definitely something wrong with it on Chrome.

Compared to Adblock (not "Plus") it eats twice more memory.

And I really hate that ABP blocks images on Twitter that are posted using twitpic & instagram services. The worst thing is that ABP is blocking them even with all filters deleted. :(
-------------------------

I am still lacking customization, possibility to pick some particular part of a page to be blocked by myself. Also I am missing quick, easy to access  functionality "don't block this page" (add to exclusions).

Adblock without a plus is a much better extension it blocks more adverts and supports local lists and custom add servers. this plus version I uninstalled within 2 minutes as it could not block adds from the main info portals.
-------------------------

It blocked some element which is not an ad :( Otherwise, *****
-------------------------

I love it in Firefox, but not so much in Chrome, since I still frequently see ads on Facebook. If I try to create custom filters to block the ads, I end up blocking a lot of FB content too. This has never happened to me on the  Firefox version. Problem is, I now like Chrome so much better than FF, I don't want to switch back.

Why is it not blocking any ads anymore?

Doesn't block all ads. Not on Gizmodo or Google.

It worked great until a couple of days ago. It does not block anything. I hope they get it fixed.

Works fine however it does load ads and doesn't prevent them from being downloaded like the firefox version. Therefore, just for a split second you will see the ads but they will disappear shortly after. Also, I am unable to whitelist specific pages withing a website. I have to whitelist the entire domain. Unless someone here can tell me how exactly to do this.
-------------------------

Still beta? I've been using this for month without any problem. I think this extension is better than AdBlock, this extension can block more elements and more lightweight.

It doesn't block nearly as many ads as Adblock did, but this one works with Rockmelt :/

This is worthless. It works temporary, and every time I open up my browser after a restart, my block list is deleted. Then I have to block all the ads all over again.  This program works GREAT with Firefox, but not Chrome. Every ad I put on my list, AUTOMATICALLY deletes itself. What can I do to fix this?
-------------------------

I loved this a lot when it worked properly, hands down the best Ad Blocker. Now it keeps letting ads through often, but it still blocks YouTube video ads!

It's great! A little too great actually! It's so sensitive it actually 'blocked' any adsense gadgets from appearing in my blogger layout...it nearly drove me insane trying to work out why I couldn't see them. Might be something the dev can look at so as to prevent this in the future? :)

I've always used Adblock but recently I'm having trouble; it's not working.

Does not work. Have tried various times to block ad elements on sites. once your refresh its back. Bad app, needs to be written better.

This Extention cuses an error message when we click on extention links on all websites.i see a small window from chrome that says i have to reload the page and when i refresh the page nothing happens and it goes to extentions homepage. please fix this big problem. i have to disable ABP every time before clicking on an extention link. i also don´t have any blocked link manually in the list.
-------------------------
block
It updates the lists just fine, and blocks ads that I need blocked. It's much faster than the other adblock, which I've disabled for now until it picks back up. It'll slow down sites that are media-rich, so be sure to add trusted sites that have unobtrusive ads to your whitelist. For everything else, it'll speed things up.

I don't see the icon in the address bar, nor do I see a 'Block Element' in the right-click menu.
-------------------------
block
Something's changed:

1) When Chrome starts up and loads pages from previous session, ads are NOT blocked. But reloading the page makes the ads disappear.

2) Some ads are coming through that weren't before.
-------------------------
block
It does a good job of blocking adds except unclick new windows, but it also seems to stop the Google+ page from auto-updating which is a real pain so will have to go back to the other adblock plus for now.
-------------------------
block
As of a few days ago, absolutely refuses to block ANY ads, even after updating.
-------------------------
block
Definitely no where near the Firefox version. Lately it doesn't seem to be blocking any ads at all. Very disappointing. Considering going back to Firefox.
-------------------------
block
I have not been to a website yet that it has blocked ads on. On some sites, it does not block them at all, but instead groups all the ads on the  page in a block in the upper left hand corner, so you can't even see the page.
-------------------------

Fantastic addition.  I've had no problems whatsoever with Adblock Plus.  It now hurts my eyes to browse the web on other computers/browsers who do not have this add on.  

It is also VERY easy to block customer adds/images in the (rare) case of ABP not catching certain adds.

This should really come standard with all browsers.
-------------------------
block
I (Chrome 16.0.912.77 m; Win 7) have been using this now for a very long time. Until recently it seemed a perfect ad-blocker (=5 stars rating). However, since a couple of weeks the ads on many of the websites I visit regularly (very popular ones) are not blocked but shown as if Adblock Plus (Beta) would not have been installed (= this is, why I have to subtract one star). When I manually update the filters, everything is ad free again. However, I do not want do that over and over again. What is wrong? Is that a known bug? Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks!
-------------------------
block
Used to be excellent and now is completely useless!
What happened, now it doesn't block anything at all!!
-------------------------
block
It was doing alright, but after a recent update, the popup to "add" ads is transparent and treats the ad like a window, so I am not able to click "add". My browser slowed significantly, as well as many ads not being blocked.  I switched to regular Adblock until the issues are resolved
-------------------------
block
The last few weeks has stopped working and blocks nothing anymore.
-------------------------
block
I have been using ABP for  several months and i used to be satisfied with it, because it is much lighter and much faster than the ordinary AdBlock. However, lately, let's say the last few weeks, i have noticed that the block - lists have started to become outdated every single day, but ABP doesn't update them so often and it looks as if it didn't find them outdated. As soon as i update them manually every ad disappears till the next day when the same ads appear again and i have to make another manual update. This is rather annoying and i am really disappointed. Everything would be fine if there were a single option for the user to choose how often to make these updates automatically or at least to check for updates. I would be grateful to the developer if he puts this option in the final release. If there is such an option but i have not noticed it i apologize
-------------------------
block
This used to be a fantastic extension but it appears to have fallen behind, in recent weeks. I am seeing a lot of advertising that it should be blocking - even from known banner servers and the like.
-------------------------
block
This plugin has completely stopped working for ads from certain sources. Not only does it not block them on their own, but manually created filters for certain specific ad domains are reverted every time the browser is restarted. This behavior is suspicious to say the least, but one thing is certain: this plugin no longer does what it claims to do.
-------------------------
block
Having migrated from Firefox to Chrome, I find that the version of AdBlock for Chrome blocks far fewer ads, and almost no flash-based ads. In fact I can't even right click on the flash ads to block them myself.

Many times the pop-up window for blocking an element is partially or entirely hidden under other parts of the page.

Wild cards don't seem to actually work.

Ads from google aren't blocked in chrome. hmm.

It is better than nothing, but not nearly as good as I experience in firefox.
-------------------------
block
Does a great job of blocking almost all ads, but still has issues with video ads.

This doesn't block many ads out there, and also fails to remember preferences on previously blocked ads, particularly google ones.

Having used ABP on Firefox without any problems I am somewhat disappointed with the Chrome version so far.

I loved it until it recently stopped doing its job. I now see a lot of ads that were usually blocked. This needs to be fixed.

This addon has been rock solid for as long as I've used it. Blocks everything, thoroughly recommended...

Its perfect! except.... it wont block fullscreen youtube ads. or whenever i go on someones youtube profile it will show video ads.is their any way this can be fixed?

Not as effective at blocking on Chrome as it is on Firefox.  Since I've adopted Chrome because of Firefox issues with settings that nobody seems able to cure, I've found that regular Ad Block is much more effective than this beta version.

This probably blocks the viruses that you get from some ads too
-------------------------

Good! But sometimes doesnt work well on some websites.

This should block partypoker pop ups too...

Freezes a few seconds on many sites, because on Chrome, you cannot program your extension to block networking like the Firefox version does.

Adblock Plus! Nice! I hope that it will block the annoying video commersials before many youtube videos. :)

Looks like it really blocks. Even if AD's by such bad spammer as Google. 
I'll continue to use it a bit more..
-------------------------

FANTASTIC! Blocks even video ads which are my biggest gripe.

Still much left to match ABP on Firefox. Quite awkward handling of the filters, no control of what filters are used, how effective they are, what objects are blocked, what can be blocked etc...
-------------------------

should make it like the firefox version where you can block a frame or ad just by right clicking it
-------------------------

It only do.esn´t work on Gmail. It doesn´t load the page if you block the ad

Works much better than AdBlock. Always blocks video and flash ads as well as images.

Hit and miss, but what I'm sticking with, with chrome for now.  Inline video ads don't usually get blocked, and my big question now is can this block jimmy wales' ugly puss from showing up everytime I go to wikipedia.  It will block the element if I refresh, but sure enough next time I go there it is
-------------------------
block
It is good, but I would like the option to unblock a certain element on a page (if it isnt there already). If this tool is already here, then how do you enable it? Adblock sometimes blocks the facebook like box (on wikia sites).

Owned this extension for years. For a while I legitimately forgot that websites have massive banner ads and popups all over till I was on my buddy's. 10/10, lulls you into forgetting that the internet is a hunting ground for your private information

Think of the internet as some sort of terrible amalgamation of a cesspit and a jungle, littered with things you need and want. As you're trudging through the muck of unruly pop-up quicksand and attempted forced consent to take your backpack snacks, you also have to combat ticks. Adblock plus is an ever-improving bubble shield that shall surely guide most travelers to less tracking and greater ease on the web until they are inevitably bought out by some advertising mega-giant. Until that day my review remains true, but if you're reading this, and you think you're all that is left; take hope. We're out there. We're rebuilding, and rebelling, hoping once again for our time to rise non-violently behind other mighty devs.

It's dangerous to go alone, install this.

Used to be good. It's no longer blocking Twitch ads. And most news sites as well simply detect it and have a pop-up that blocks viewing the page, which defeats the purpose.
Been like this a while and they still haven't found a way around this, I might as well uninstall and try others.

Bye bye stupid ads! No more video ads or 'acceptable' ads! ABP has blocked so many annoying ads that I don't ever want to see again.

A tip: Turn on the Anti Adblock Block filter in Settings and teach the money-hungry websites a lesson by disabling their "disable your adblocker" pop-ups!
-------------------------
popup
it was good but now it cant even block youtube premium pop-up
-------------------------

I used to believe this was the greatest adblocker ever. But lately it appears that it allows adds on certain sites, no matter what options you chose. Facebook owned sites are the worst by far for pop-ups, but Google owned sights are sneaking them in sometimes too. Youtube (Owned by Google) seems to be the only place where video ads actually get blocked.
-------------------------
popup
I love Ad-blocker Plus. I used to use it on a Microsoft Laptop (sorry about mentioning them) I now use it on my Acer Chromebook - I have just discovered I can even stop getting those irritating popups that tell the user that there are cookies as if we didn't know that.
-------------------------
popup
Don't bother. This USED To be the best, but they are now bribed by all the ad companies to not block ads or popups anymore. I switched to another one called "Ublock Origin" which actually was created by the original creator of this app, back when this used to be good before they took bribes from the ad companies. After switching away from this, I can finally use sites and download stuff without the fake virus downloads and fake download popups showing up anymore.

I've been using this free service for years and have become spoiled by it's wonderful seamless effectiveness!! So much so that it's  intolerable using websites like YouTube on my phone due to the barrage of garbage you're hit with constantly. Other websites have Google ads and others that take up  so much of the screen the content is no longer visible for over 3 flicks of the finger to scroll. Ridiculous!! Don't these people know that makes their websites look cheap and shabby? I know this is likely a normal experience to most but being protected by ABP  on my laptop where I spend most of my time has reduced my tolerance to zilch. I'm not sure why I haven't installed it on this cell I got last May, other than the fact that I already have no internal storage left due to the auto-loaded garbage that cells come with today-and I only have FB (not messenger) installed out of the big 4 media sites. [Thanks, Amazon shopping app etc].  Again, ridiculous!
My only ABP complaint is one that I almost couldn't have made due to the Very recent discovery-then loss of the matter.  I'd just found that there was an option to zero in on certain areas where ads are generated and pop up regularly, which would allow you to select then block just that offense. Alas,  after doing a reset on my poorly advised Acer Chromebook (pretty much a glorified cell phone in itself), this feature is no longer listed in the options anywhere.  I'm not talking about the "Block pop-up ads" check box, but the one that prompted selecting a certain area, which would then become highlighted within a box and featured in confirming whether that is what you wanted blocked. 
Ah, well. Easy come, easy go. It's in no way a deal breaker.  ABP's service was already making my web browsing experience 100% better as it was,  so no real complaints here from me. Thank You!!

No more frustration from pop-ups, easy to turn off for sites that won't work with ad block apps and continues to block junk from the rest.
-------------------------
popup
very good , blocking most ads but need a pop-up blocker and update to block ads on Facebook and YouTube
-------------------------
popup
I installed both Adblock and Adblock Plus. I may be compromising my computer's performance but there is nothing noticeable that I can detect, except not a one annoying ad anywhere! I am now going to activate the privacy feature and see how that performs.

Well, after that silly move I uninstalled Adblock and have been using ABP since 2014 and have no complaints that I can detect. However, maybe a pop-up blocker would be sufficient. I choose to enable ABP site by site.
-------------------------
popup
Amazing for all the ads and pop-ups on soap2day.to! It blocked 13 ads on the first 30 seconds of using it!
-------------------------
popup
Just wish it blocked the pop-ups. Otherwise does a great job.
-------------------------
popup
Enjoyed for the while until when trying to use youtube, I kept getting these popup ads that would occur everytime I clicked anywhere. It happened a while ago and when I deleted my extensions, nothing happened until I deleted adblocker. I got it from this site and it had shown "10,000,000+ users" at the time.
-------------------------
popup
I'd been using this this extension along with ublock for years without an issue, or so I thought. Sometimes ads would slip out here and there, but with ublock's element blocker it wasn't really an issue. 
Until today. Google chrome gave me a popup saying "This extension may be dangerous. "Site blocker" has been disabled becaues it contains malware". It had blocked this extension.
Doing some research, I learned that sometimes extensions have adware in them. 
There was one particular instance that I thought this may apply to. When I applied to a new college this year, some of their pages had ads where you wouldn't normally expect them (for example, financial aid and pages that required personal info like SSN). My other college never had this issue but I thought, 'Maybe this college just runs different, being public and what not'.
Turns out it was because of this adblocker. Since disabling, I have not seen any ads on that college website. 
It makes me wonder how many ads that I've been seeing have specifically been because of this adblocker... Well, my other adblockers work fine so I guess I'l live without this one. I have no idea how well this one worked since it was working in tandem with other adblockers, but the internet still seems to look the same without this one--adless!
-------------------------
popup
I've been using it for a year but I think youtube is having a glitch now. Sometimes pop-up ads show up or I have to wait 5 seconds to watch a video, but the video ad won't play. I'm not sure if it's a youtube update
-------------------------
popup
It does not block 100% of ads and it blocks a lot of popup buttons and buttons from working
-------------------------
popup
pop-up blocker add it it would make it better
-------------------------
popup
Let's be real here. IF I wanted to see ads, I wouldn't even use this plugin. Yet y'all whitelisting sites and their ads here and there by calling them "non-intrusive/acceptable" ads just to get cash from the very sites that nobody wanted ads from. No. You guys have been the backstabber of your own plugin. If anything, by using this trash I've been seeing more ads and "aRE YOU USING ADBLOCK?" popups. What's even the point of this?
-------------------------
popup
Works wonders for me, YouTube was the reason I decided to get this extension and it works as though YouTube doesn't have any ads. Another great thing I found while on the web was that the sites that usually have those pop-up ads and the ones that show up in the bottom right of the screen are gone. I've had this extension for about a year now and it works all the time and doesn't slow down my computer. I have an AMD ryzen 5 1400 and 16gb of 3200hz ram. Its better than some computers, however its not the best computer. Either way I know for a fact that most computers can run this extension because I had seen a lot of people complaining about that.
-------------------------
popup
Does NOT block ads on Pandora.

2020 Update:
I retried this extension to see if it would fix the errors in YT, maybe it was some sort of issue with Adblock (the original and more efficient ad blocker) slacking off or something. But no, it has the same issue, so I'm re-removing it, as Adblock still does more than ABP ever has.

Also, I find it ridiculous that ABP presented a popup claiming it's blocked 295 ads so far when I haven't used it for more than two videos and this page, and only after I started updating this review. Very misleading and dishonorable, ABP. Shame on you.
-------------------------
popup
Very helpful app. Just needs a popup stopper or blocker. Perfect otherwise.
-------------------------
popup
Very good for blocking pop-ups and other advertisements.
Not so good for blocking specific parts of websites, such as videos from a specific YouTuber.
-------------------------
popup
Used to be great, then they sold out to advertisers. Lets some ads through anyway (advertisers that pay adblock) and allows those obnoxious "Disable your adblock to see this page" popups - ublock blocks those. Been using ABP for over a decade, but I'm done.
-------------------------
popup
Blocks popups and notifications, but includes its own!
-------------------------
popup
these blockers no longer work, websites are now detecting the blockers and putting a huge popup that will not go away until you disable the blocker. they need to either fix this or remove it because it will not work.
-------------------------
popup
It works, with the exception of sites that are using an 'adblocker wall' which force you to either whitelist or subscribe.  An increasing number of sites are doing this defeating the whole purpose of having an adblocker in the first place.  Developers have stated that it's possible to block these popups very easily, yet they don't, saying that they have chosen some kind of moral high ground (when it is more likely that they have been bribed by publishers to disable the adblock on certain sites.)  Go with one of the other adblock extensions like uBlock that actually work!
-------------------------
popup
ever since I started using this addon I have been plagued with malaware popups
-------------------------
popup
get popups blocker extension
-------------------------
popup
it was relly good at blocking ads and popups  but sometimes (when my WIfi is great) my video keeps loading if its not adblocks fault then ignore this review overall great tool
-------------------------
popup
It strange that they don't have pop-up blocker in the first place. Despite of pop-up blocker already in browser, the fact that adblocker let it go through is very questional. The pop-up ad is more annoy than normal ad.
-------------------------
popup
Isn't pop-up blocking pretty much a default (either as simply built-in, or as setting that may be on or off by default) in pretty much any decent browser (including some fringe browsers, desktop or mobile and even most text browsers - I'm betting at least ELinks probably has even option for this - Links, Links 2, eww (actually not text-only, it's a browser for eMacs, which can be ran in terminal as well as GUI window), w3m (which also has an eMacs front end that also shows images, even though w3m is basically a text browser - but it has ability to show images with colored block characters, if enabled. How many pixels one character is in width and height can be set, because using one character per pixel would easily fill the whole terminal even with small image - so far I prefer w3m in eMacs, although apparently eww is written in pure eLisp and is thus native eMacs application; people need to understand that comparing eMacs with other "editors" and "IDE's" is that it may be the main use of eMacs, but it's really an all-capable OS within an OS), they all probably have pop-up blocking either by default or as an option.

I'm pretty certain Chrome and Chromium has had this for a long time, has it not? I'm not checking right now, but I'm surprised if not. If it had not though, I'm sure the most common ad-block lists already block ad popups anyway, thus leaving only actual purposeful pop-up's (which seem to have been disappeared, as people can do this more user-friendly way by showing so-called "in-page pop-up's", like maybe login window, and because this way the browser doesn't block they log-in window from opening :D ).

Is there something I'm misunderstanding with what you mean by "pop-up blocker"?
-------------------------
popup
Does exactly what it says. No more annoying pop-ups, accidental clicks on malware ads and nothing getting in your way of enjoying the internet. It's easy to turn off if a site blocks it or if you want to support someone through ad revenue.
-------------------------
popup
it seems to create a popup tab whenever i open chrome saying that iit has successfully reinstalled. very annoying
-------------------------
popup
Same issues here as others, just bogs down chrome and even cyberfox/firefox.  You don't appreciate just how good this extension is until you disable it and every page hits you with 5000 popups (sometimes literally).  I will say thank you to the developers for so many years of awesome browsing, hopefully it can be fixed, or perhaps it's finally a sign from above to turn off the poisonous social media and go outside.  Oh an LOL to the guy that had trouble loading "the guardian".  Don't worry, their readership is so low they should be insolvent in year or so, so you won't have to read that propaganda anymore anyway :)

Please get rid of auto-popup installation page that plagues chrome store extensions. I log into many computers, and get bombarded with intrusive popups from many extensions being installed, and this one is part of the problem.

Really helpful with the Advertisements on youtube thats one thing i love about AdBlock and another thing i love about it is that it automatically Blocks all those annoying pesky popups and very annoying ads on general websites which i find to be very very very aggravating and youtube to because i hate when i would be half way through a tutorial on youtube and bam im hit with a pesky Advertisement but with AdBlock Fear Not Fellower users AdBlock Blocks all Advertisements like you want it to do
-------------------------

add some virus popup block update
-------------------------

This is detected immediately and an annoying pop-up appears saying you have an adblocker.
-------------------------

This adblocker blocks almost all ads. Advertisers have begun to find a way around adblock plus due to its extreme popularity. Do NOT get adguard plus (there are better adblockers the adguard, and adguard is the only one that needs a paid subscription).However, it is not made to eliminate especially rare varieties of pop-up ads or banner ads. For removing banner ads (not a form of popups), I would recommend the "Removes Taboola" google chrome extension by jon.
-------------------------
popup
USED to work well, but recently, I've been seeing a lot of banner ads on websites and some pop-up ones have been appearing without it closing.
-------------------------
popup
The irony: Adblock Plus has been running its own pop-up ads.

Time to remove this rubbish.
-------------------------

PLEASE make it possible to block the so-called "exit-intention popups." They are extremely annoying.

- not compatible with yandex browser in android.
Can you develop it to be more compatible with yandex browser for android ?
- on google chrome its one of the best ad blocking extensions but still lack the ability to stop unwanted popups pages so I use it in combination with poper blocker extension.
Can you develop it to block popups and popunder pages ?
- I still need to use other extentions like adguard or kaspersky total security integrated extention ( anti banner & private browsing ) to be able to block all ads and unwanted popup pages.
Can you develop it and use advantages of these extensions so I can rely only on your extension for blocking ads, popups and popunders ?
-------------------------
popup
After a brief stint with uBlock, I'm back to ABP because it does a much better job at blocking elements of a page than uBlock does. The fail part of ABP is it's ability to block pop-ups. uBlock did a much better job and to supplement ABP's element blocking ability, I've had to install a 3rd party extension (Poper Blocker) to do the job ABP keeps choosing not to block. I may need to find a different solution than to use two extension to do the job of what what claims it can do both.
-------------------------
popup
Would not block some of the nastiest pop-up ads. Why?
-------------------------
popup
i think its a contradiction because you run adblocker because you do not want adds , yet adblocker spams you with notifications that are totally irrelevant, Unwanted!!!! and just plain annoying and as far as i am aware you cant disable them or turn it off ... so be ware that you will be spammed by totally uncalled for popups and notifications
-------------------------
popup
You support the "YOU HAVE A VIRUS DOWNLOAD NOW" ads and pop-ups? Because that's usually what I use this for.
-------------------------
popup
Doesn't have many options, does not recognize pop-ups
-------------------------

It doesn't block ads anymore. and not just the ads on the side of a website, but also pop-ups and sites that redirect you to ads instead of getting to the site you wanted to get to in the first place.
-------------------------
popup
I love it, works well & no complaints! Just one suggestion though - for some reason when the little yellow dialogue telling me an ad has been blocked pops up, I kind of ignore it/don't notice it. Sometimes these are popups I actually want to come up and I get confused waiting for something to happen lol.

It would be great to have a few different 'skins'(?) for it!
-------------------------
popup
This USED to be a great adblocker, blocked everything. Now it locks virtually nothing. No ads, no pop-ups. Even when you try to add blocks per site. Don't waste your time, search for another adblocker.
-------------------------

While is does block very, very little adds, it does not block  most pop-up tabs. I have had this for little than a week and it does not work at all.Is there a better adblocker that works becausemy computer has a lot(!) of ads. Thanks!
-------------------------
popup
Still getting a ton of pop-up windows, from a ton of scam companies, with a fresh install so no mal-ware, no viruses no nothing.

So clearly you are either taking money from these companies to add them to a back-end whitelist or they have a found a method of working around the ad-block extension and very tight chrome settings.
-------------------------

I don't mind acceptable adds but there are far too many popup popunders now happening when i surf

Some pop-up ads are opening even after installing adblock plus.

This is unhelpful. This scams you thinking it will block pop-ups. Well, it doesn't block that.

it used to work really well  but now its barely blocking anything. i get constant popups again and i also see ads constantly. even the ones ive blocked before. so frustrated.

Nice!! blocked all ads and popups perfectly and not even a single coin spended for this. Thanx so much!!

Used to be fantastic, blocked every ad and popup, now it only blocks ads from sites that haven't paid to be allowed thru anyway.

Dosen't do a thing to prevent popups by "DownloadOpenSoftware.

It use to block most everything but recently ads are catching up with this. There are a lot of popups not being caught, especially first time clicks on website bodies that pop open an ad page.

good but some pop-up adds  
can not preventing
-------------------------

I've had this for quite some time and forgot that I ever had an issue with pop-ups.  The pop-ups have stopped 100%!  Highly suggest getting this.
-------------------------
popup
Without this extension the web pages are just so cluttered and annoying that reading and focusing is quite difficult. Ads are one thing but when a web site is over 99% ads it becomes ridiculous trying to read content. This extension restores sanity to web pages.
In summary, it blocks popups, it thins out ads on a large scale. If you can make a donation make one. Remember if a million people give just 1 buck then these guys will be able to continue their efforts. The web would be unthinkable without this extension.

I think ABP is a useful program, And I appreciate it. Recently though, It has let me down. I have recently began to ads again. While none of them are popups or malware, They are very tedious and annoying. If only they could counteract it. But going b this, I would give ABP a 4/5.

I have always had adblock and I had no problems with pop-ups but with adblock plus almost every site I visit to stream shows I am bombarded with at least 2 pop-ups/video stream many of which contain malware. The simple most popular adblock worked much better for me. thanks anyway.

I had the same issue with crazy pop-ups and they stopped as soon as I uninstalled Adblock Plus. How creepy.

Super amazing! Its free and it really works. saved my life...and my grade. the popups and adds got so bad and make my computer so slow I could hardly move from tab to tab. I would Rate 10/5 if I could! Would DEFFINITLY recomend to friends and family!

did NOT prevent other ads. it created pop-up ads.

Works for me! But many of my favorite sites are beginning to block me because I am blocking their popups. They are catching on to your service. If this continues your service will not be useful in the near futue!

Allows Ads that target words to pop-up. No way to disable it. I removed the extension since, it's not a full Ad-block solution anymore.

Blocks everything till now and I visited many different sites. No commercials, no ads, no pop-ups.
Maybe its messing with your firewall, check settings/options on both of them. 

Good luck, I hope you find any kind of solution.

Works well, just setting up a new PC and added this again. Combine it with Better Popup Blocker and you ready for anything. Better Popup Blocker isn't listed here any more, but get it from Softpedia and just drop the .crx file into chrome extensions.

Its awsome. IF you still have pop-ups ads in ur computer, you have an Adware installed in youre computer

What's with this recent behaviour of giving me popups that say "This site has been known to provide targeted advertising to Adblock Plus  users - would you like to block these - yes/no?" 

Whose idiotic idea was it to distract and annoy the user with a popup to ask them if they want to not be distracted and annoyed?
-------------------------

This actually blocks nearly 100% of ads. What people don't realize is that they have had ad software previously downloaded on their computer. This app cannot of course block those ads. Check your programs and features if you get strange popups or ads.
-------------------------
popup
Uninstalled and re installed repeatedly. Ads in the background, in pop-ups and in the margins are removed. But Video ads STILL play! Which is the specific reason i downloaded this app. Needs improvement.
-------------------------
popup
Too All thoes who said it stopped working reason... Google hates it. They make minor Chrome updates to block ABP constantly.
Reason why it lags is cause they perform updates without you knowing to block this.  It sucks but google relies on revenue from popups and ads places in Youtube(which this blocks and stops). Google hates it with a passion... that is also why ABP was not allowed on the store for about 4 months.

It does work, and it run perfectly fine. Doesnt lag anything at all. If you lag or have problems it is your machine usually from viruses already and crap that has already bogged down your system.

If you get FlashBlock as well and Ghostery too this can solve alot of problems in for you period.

i kept getting pop-ups when i got it

this is a fantastic extension but lately its been pretty bad, it will block 3 things and then just give up and then let everything else pop-up. i mean sometimes i just click on the page of a website and with no links and then a new tab opens to some survey or scam. its quite annoying.
-------------------------

It sucks, the websites I go on still have all of these pop-ups.
-------------------------
popup
Same as Suzy for me it stopped working recently on many popups.
-------------------------
popup
This has started not to work. All kinds of ads are popping up, and they're popping up in new windows, not just an ad that's embedded.  What's up with the popup ad windows??
-------------------------
popup
Adblock Plus is amazing and I recommend it to everyone. It completely blocked all ads and pop-ups. I accidently clicked something that gave me a lot of pop-ups all the time, but adblock blocks it. Also in youtube, it is great to skip all the ads.
-------------------------
popup
I remember when adblock actually blocked ads, now I get popups much often than I did without it. At first installation it seems like a perfect extension but all you get afterwards is an year's worth of ads. Also, it slows down my chrome.
-------------------------
popup
works great but on most sites, however, i've been getting pop-ups on facebook everytime i click on a post that bypass adblock.
-------------------------
popup
I think most websites found a way around this because a lot of pop-up ads are coming up all over almost every webpage
-------------------------
popup
i love it. it would be great if it stopped popups so i don't have to install another extension. 

Also it does not have a 'undo' of the last filter. so if you filter something by mistake, it is time consuming to delete that filter. you have to find it and you have to know which one it is.
-------------------------
popup
After installing this, I'm no getting ad pop-ups all over the place!!! When I signed in to access my online banking, on 2 times, a pop-up appeared offering a free credit check!!! This product is bogus!!!! NOT RECOMMENDED
-------------------------
popup
Awesome addon that dramatically improves browsing. Also removes all the annoying addons that bring up a lot of pop-ups and generally make browsing sluggish.
-------------------------
popup
Normally good, however the past 6 months sites have started to outsmart it, I think.  Most have a delay and then a popup appears in the middle of the screen to subscribe, share, whatever.  You have to click them away.  This happens on most modern sites now and it's really annoying.  ABP does not block popups anymore.
-------------------------
popup
It seems some Websites have found a way to detect my adblock. They have chosen to tell me, " Disable your adblock before you can view our content". I choose to do without your content, because you use malicious advertisers. 
You see it is not the advertisements I am trying to avoid. 
It is the dirty aggressive advertisers you allow to harass innocent people with malware, in your face popups, and filth most browsers try to avoid.
Unless you can certify all of your sponsors, I will keep my adblock, thank you.
-------------------------
popup
It was great at first - no pop-ups or YouTube ads, but they're back and I don't know why!
-------------------------
popup
I installed this extension due to the annoyance of all pop-up ads on the lower and right sides of my screen. It seemed to work well as far as that went, but for some reason I was unable to access Facebook AT ALL after 2 days of having it installed. I removed it and Facebook was accessible. 

Ads wouldn't be so bad if they weren't so obnoxious. When they interfere with my ability to see/read content on certain websites, they get annoying. If the sites that depend on ads to operate would make them less annoying, people wouldn't seek out extensions like ABP to filter them out.

Unfortunately, these extensions are garbage. They always seem to do more or less than advertised or desired.
-------------------------
popup
A must for anyone who streams online sports or similar. Blocks all those stupid adds that popup on the stream player and stops you getting malware! Highly recommended.
-------------------------
popup
luv dis app all the apps vanished into thin air and all pop-ups gone thanks for da
-------------------------
popup
It does what it says it will do - block all the annoying ads!
It's also really simple to disable it on specific sites where you do want the pop-up
So glad I downloaded this.
-------------------------
popup
blocks all the crap pop-ups that no one likes.
-------------------------
popup
compared to "adblock", this thing blocks virtually nothing. I get popup ads all over newspaper sites, etc.

the similar name is confusing people, to be sure... adblock seems far superior in terms of consistently blocking tons of ads.
-------------------------
popup
It worked for the longest time, but then all of a sudden, it stopped. Up until yesterday, adblock had been working, but now, all it does is block the images of adds, and I still get pop-ups. Please update soon, the adds will drive me crazy. I've read reviews, and this is happening to others. What is happening? I've tried reinstalling it, but it does nothing. I am very frustrated now. Please, please, update or fix adblock.
-------------------------
popup
I love this extension..
No Ads!! No Popups!!
-------------------------
popup
I panicked there for a second. I've been using this program for years, and all of a sudden I was seeing adds everywhere. Did the IT thing. I uninstalled it, and reinstalled it. Pop-ups and ads are gone again. Whew!

Viewing the internet with things flashing at you all day is no way to live!
-------------------------
popup
Stopped working recently. No idea why. Tons of popups and ads now.
-------------------------
popup
it doesnt block any youtube adds or
 any other website adds whatsoever , its jut taking up memory space , it blocks popups thats about it
-------------------------
popup
It used to be my favorite thing about Google chrome, but recently it's stopped working altogether. I get ads on YouTube videos, I get pop-ups, you name it, I've got it. Totally worthless.
-------------------------
popup
Did work................now I get more ad's &pop-up's than ever before!!!! WTF is this crap?
-------------------------
popup
It's been a great extension for a very long time, but recently quit working as well. I'm getting a lot of annoying adds and pop-ups all of the sudden! Please update!
-------------------------
popup
Doesn't work as well as it used to; although the popups and other tabs don't always load, I still get them. I used to not have those.
-------------------------
popup
THE BEST TO USE IF YOU WANT NO POPUPS!! ;-)
-------------------------
popup
I would've rated 5 stars, but AdBlock Plus doesn't really work alone.  I tried it as my only ad blocker, but ads still got through -as well as popups.  But once I got regular AdBlock alongside Plus, the popups and ads stopped.  Wish it would've worked on its own.  Also doesn't block those annoying, bright blue ads on Tumblr.
-------------------------
popup
I just installed it worked great, until I tried to load the casino games on Facebook.  It can't tell the difference between a pop-up and a game loading.  I like the games more that I'll put up with the ads. But Adblock+ is gone.
-------------------------
popup
ABP does literally nothing. I get ad pop-ups on EVERY web page I visit.
-------------------------
popup
It worked...until lately. It blocks a lot of ads but not everything. I still get pop-up ads at some sites (the dangerous ones that try to instantly download .exe files to your computer without asking the second the page loads). What irks me most of all is that it does not WHATSOEVER block the annoying ads and commercials on YouTube. I hate that and is why I want an ad blocker!!!! In the past it used to block them entirely but now not at all >:/ I would switch to another app if I found one that blocked the ads on YouTube. I find that 100% intolerable. I LOATHE ads!
-------------------------
popup
does not block many pop-up ads.
-------------------------
popup
ABP was incredibly useful until about a week ago when I started getting pop-ups and weird ad banners left right and center.
-------------------------
popup
I am writing a review on this because it is an awesome app, but lately it isn't blocking ad pop-ups and I am getting several of them.  Not as many as when I used to use internet explorer, but enough to start to annoy me.  I don't mind ads, but I mind ads that get in the way of what I am doing.  So, it was 5 stars, but decreased to 4 stars.  If it continues without being fixed, then I will sadly delete it, as it will no longer serve its purpose.  Thus, it becomes 0 stars in my mind.
-------------------------
popup
No longer blocks pop-up ads in some sites(including torrent sites). Uses 50+ MB of RAM. Can be replaced by Ghostery. Only offers support for Easy List. Whitelist only option: no blacklist! Too many concessions to vendors, using the "non-intrusive ads" excuse.
-------------------------
popup
It has been a 5-star until recently.
Now a lot of popups, popunders and ads are starting to leak through.
Considering a move to "the other" Adblock, even though I don't really want to.
-------------------------
popup
Adblock Plus is no longer effective.  Ads are getting through, and pop-ups are becoming a regular sight on my screen.  The filter lists seem to be ineffective all together.
-------------------------
popup
AdBlocker used to block ALL popup ads, but now a few are getting through. I heard its because now companies pay AdBlocker to get pass them. Trolls.
-------------------------
popup
I have been getting popups and ads on the bottom of the screen
-------------------------
popup
I've been using ABP for a few years now.
With the new update its only blocking half of the things it should! So many  ads and pop-ups are getting through. This is really disappointing and I hope they fix this. It worked perfectly before.
-------------------------
popup
it block all the ads i hate 
i really hate popups so it works well blocking those too
-------------------------
popup
Really helps with browser security. Blocks all other popups that google misses
-------------------------
popup
I've been using ABP for a few years now and it never sucked as much as it does now. Before the update it blocked 99% of the adds on every single page, even the pop-up ads. I didn't even knew Youtube had so much advertisement till the update of ABP allowed many of those ads to come trough. I'm changing, because I don't like it anymore. It does not longer block anything! I need to instruct the app what to  block and that is annoying.
-------------------------
popup
I have changed my opinion of this extension to a 3 star, as of late(could be because of latest update) is has been allowing ads and popups through, Result of which I had to manually add the ads to the blocked filter... fix this asap please.
-------------------------
popup
Adblock Plus was AMAZING. But then it completely stopped working and I have no idea as to why. Any and all ads show up, whether they be annoying pop-up ads or tiny little boxes in the corner of my screen.
-------------------------
popup
It works fairly well for the most part; I've only recently had a few problems with some pop-up adds showing at weird times (which I'm not quite sure was because of a problem from this, but considering Chrome has a build-in pop-up blocker it is annoying) I'll probably still keep it, but I'm really cautious about whether it's actually working...
-------------------------
popup
The previous revisions were FANTASTIC. Chrome updated. No longer works at all. Popups, ads, embedded video commercials. All the joys of the internet are back. Woot.
-------------------------
popup
This plugin treats links and check boxes as pop-ups or ads, frustrated the hell out of me as to why I couldn't click on them. I had to always right click on them and open the link in a new tab, and of course that's not possible for the check boxes. Removing this crap and going back to the normal AdBlock.
-------------------------
popup
Ads and popups are starting to show after years of using this.
-------------------------
popup
it worked for about 6 months but recently it hasn't. ive been getting tons of popups, at least one word in every sentence is highlighted green as an ad, and all it does to other ads is that it deletes the image.
-------------------------
popup
Its not working anymore. I've used this for about the year and this is the first time it hasn't been working. Now, theres ads and popups everywhere
-------------------------
popup
Never worked properly for me.If anything,it's creating more popups than normal
-------------------------
popup
Wow takes all the bad bits from sites including popups and annoying video adverts on catchup tv sites
-------------------------
popup
By far the most useful plugin for internet users. Quit wasting time with popups and ads. And please, if you can, help support the team by donating
-------------------------
popup
Works perfectly to remove advertisements, but sometimes popups that AREN'T advertisements get messed up (Ex: Pop-up logins). But I resolved this by disabling adblock while I login, checking keep me logged in, then reblocking ads.
-------------------------
popup
for the few days,it ain't working i tried reinstalling it but the ads won't go away, pop-ups have started appearing google ads show up please do something
-------------------------
popup
This addon is perfect. It blocks all kinds of ads and pop-ups window.

But since a few days ads are starting to get through the add-on. I'm disappointed about that, now I have to wait the ad  to be done on YouTube to watch my video or skip the ad. 

I assume the producers of this add-on will fix it anytime soon because this started only like 4-5 days ago.
-------------------------
popup
Hated this app from the beginning, because it opens a full page tab every time Chrome opens advertising itself.  OMG, it's a pop-up blocker that *IS* a pop-up ad itself!

Functionally, the results are really inconsistent.  Go somewhere else for ad blocking.
-------------------------
popup
It's not doing it's job much anymore. Ads have now started to go through and so are popups.
-------------------------
popup
This extension is a very great advertisement blocker. Probably the best! It simply just stops those aggravating pop-ups and screen ads making browser the web safer and a lot less of a hassle now I'm not accidentally clicked on fake 'Download now' signs.
-------------------------
popup
It's been great up until just recently. I never saw any ads on Youtube but a couple of days ago I'm getting ads either playing before my video or as a popup within the video. I'm guessing this app just has to adjust for some recent change Youtube made to their site. Please fix!
-------------------------
popup
I installed this after adblock stopped working, but this didn't help get rid of the popups and hyperlinked word advertisements.
-------------------------
popup
almost worked.. but still get underlined words for no reason and lots of other popups
-------------------------
popup
Earlier it used to block ads ! Now it is just annoying pop-ups everywhere ...
Since Google has paid you not to block their ads, I am seeing ads everywhere...
You MUST NOT compromise the quality of your product for money...
-------------------------
popup
It's horrible, it doesn't block any ads on any website I use. It doesn't block banners, YouTube video ads, Facebook advertisements and pop-ups. It used to work perfectly fine, then suddenly stopped working.
-------------------------
popup
Not consistent, missing popups and ads from time to time.
-------------------------
popup
Youtube & Facebook annoying ads blocked permanently. No pop-ups anymore! Clean browsing experience =)
-------------------------
popup
This is the first thing I added to Chrome when I started using Chrome 2 years ago. It is basically all you need!  No more ads, no pop-ups, no banners on You-Tube.  How could you possibly say no to this? You don't even notice the ads are missing after a few months. Would never live without it.
-------------------------
popup
Add to Chrome and forget it. No daily updates and reminders to buy a better version...etc. You simply will not get pesky popups. The Adblock Plus website has links to other great utilities you can try and review but you will not be forced to visit and review. They do have other fantastic privacy products but if you just want a popup blocker that works without issues and is tried and tested then add this extension and relax.
-------------------------
popup
I find this to be much more sufficient at blocking popups than the stock chrome popup blocker.  That being said a few sites like hulu and youtube (who make money on advertisements) have found ways to discourage the use of this extension.  Hulu will make you sit and wait for 3 minutes with a blank screen instead of their normal 60 second or less commercials.  Youtube's videos will buffer at a slower rate etc.  You can disable the extension for certain sites though so it's still a must have!
-------------------------
popup
Takes care of the most annoying adds and pop-ups!
-------------------------
popup
Since the update from Thursday, Adblock Plus doesn't seem to work at all anymore... I see ads on pages, get pop-ups, see ads pre-video in youtube, and see pop up adds in youtube videos :(
-------------------------
popup
Worked up until today (6 Feb 2013)

Now nothing is blocked and I have ads and pop-ups everywhere.

Please fix.

I would usually give this extension a 5 star rating.
-------------------------
popup
This extension does well at pop-ups, but has done absolutely NOTHING for the constant redirect ads I get. 

It's worth noting that Firefox does not have the issue with redirect ads. I'd prefer to use Chrome, but the redirect ads are slowly driving me away.
-------------------------
popup
In a word - it does not work no way, no how, nadda, not a chance.  Also, tried adtwart and ad block and I still have the utube popup - seems that when utube destroyed motion empire's free movies for profit only to start charging for movies, they were not satisfied with increasing their revenues by millions upon millions,l they had to ad annoying ads that are the same as motion empire for - you guessed it - for profit at the expense of the public.  Is this the start of web site bail outs like with the banks?
-------------------------
popup
The people at AdBlock Plus have not been able to figure out why my laptop continues to pop-up the webpage that says "AdBlock Plus has been installeed" then links to  the forums if my extension doesn't work. I've done everything... Removed Chrome, Rebooted, Reinstalled fresh Chrome, Installed AdBlock Plus again. Still not working. Been like this for over a week.
-------------------------
popup
I seriously don't like it since the update. Too many pop-ups, and other ads still getting through, when before the update it was perfect! If you cant change it, could you give us a way to change it back to before the update please? Thx!
-------------------------
popup
There is a problem with Adblock Plus saving filters and its continual pop-up page and ALWAYS defaulting to allowing Google ads and Adblock Plus don't seem to want to fix it.

This issue has been addressed by saying it's a known issue, this file is corrupted, go and delete etc. If it's a known issue then FIX IT or say why it can't be fixed.  I and a whole load of other people reported it 10 months ago, back in March and it is now December. I find that unacceptable.
-------------------------
popup
It"s not able to block popup windows.what should i do?
-------------------------
popup
So, now we get the obnoxious Firefox style popups after each update unless we pay. Is that the deal? Maybe you should have let everyone know in advance that this was always the plan? Uninstalled. There are other options.
-------------------------
popup
I got rid of some of the ads, but now I am getting adblocker popups when I open google. As far as I am concerned, both are equally bad....How do I get rid of it?
-------------------------
popup
It does a great job of blocking most ads. Needs to add in the ability to block overlays, and it's Facebook ad blocking is hit and miss.

Also, since updating, I keep getting pop-ups every time I start my browser about how it just updated. I don't care. Stop pestering me. That's why I got this extension...
-------------------------
popup
If this extension can stop the pop-ups, it would be the best Google Chrome extension.
It's so good, no ads at all. The ads in my region are not in the list, but I can block them by myself (:
-------------------------
popup
quit good, blocked most of the popups ads :)
-------------------------
popup
Omg I just installed it because of the little SKIPAD popup on my computer whenever I wanted to watch videos.
I simply installed it and I haven't watched a single add since!
-------------------------

ADP has been wonderful so far, it hasn't let a single popup through. But starting today I've noticed several popups have gotten through when I visit sites, even though in the past they've been always blocked on those sites. Help?
-------------------------
popup
Writing as a web developer, I would prefer to see Adblock only blocking intrusive ads (popups, video ads, etc.), at least by default.
-------------------------
popup
I've installed TONS of apps like this that claim to block pesky ads and pop-ups... I can't believe how well this one works!!

And if an ad/popup were to slip by (which is rare) then you just click on their little icon then right-click on the ad and it stores that html info so that it won't interfere again!

ANOTHER BIG PLUS is, it doesn't have any negative effects which I've noticed on hindering the things that matter to you on a site from functioning.. which is usually another problem with these type of apps.  2 Thumbs Up!!
-------------------------
popup
It was doing alright, but after a recent update, the popup to "add" ads is transparent and treats the ad like a window, so I am not able to click "add". My browser slowed significantly, as well as many ads not being blocked.  I switched to regular Adblock until the issues are resolved
-------------------------
popup
Having migrated from Firefox to Chrome, I find that the version of AdBlock for Chrome blocks far fewer ads, and almost no flash-based ads. In fact I can't even right click on the flash ads to block them myself.

Many times the pop-up window for blocking an element is partially or entirely hidden under other parts of the page.

Wild cards don't seem to actually work.

Ads from google aren't blocked in chrome. hmm.

It is better than nothing, but not nearly as good as I experience in firefox.

Got a new laptop and had my first browsing experience without ABP for years and WOW does it make a huge difference, I didn't realize how viscously bogged down every site was with ads these days.

allows you to even block those stupid ads that pop up after the page loads so that most adblocks cant block it. also you can break websites by blocking random elements/cookies and i think thats very funny

I LOVE ABP for ten years now. Until YouTube stopped allowing my comments over their advertisements I never saw another advertisement. I swore off Chrome when they sent me (and my wife) dating sites. I asked them to stop but then they started sending gay sites. I turned off everything chrome years ago until recently. Now, if I don't allow advertisements my comments are stopped. I'm very old and getting away from all of this _ _. I just learned about Firefox however, PEACE!

Lately there is a major issue with You Tube and a very frequent STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION error page. This comes up ad nauseum, No pun intended there. I uninstalled then reinstalled to see if that would solve the issue. Upon the reinstall I was FORCED to "donate" a minimum of 5 dollars. Maybe I would like to see if the issues can be solved before being forced to pay any amount. I will be using some other ad blocker in this case. Because if the issue persists why would I want to give you any of my money? SMH

It stopped blocking elements on many sites. Ads seem to be getting more and more protected against Adblock Plus nowadays.

Generally excellent - a "set it and forget it" application, and a low-maintenance relationship. But recently, it seems to be coinciding with Facebook posts failing to load content, such as photographs, memes, and even text from posts with those contents. I have to disable it in order to see many of the posts in my regular groups. This is a new development, and has never been the case in the past.

This app currently breaks facebook. Today is April 30,2022

The extension blocks the ads, that's for sure. But, I think it fails to stop the trackers, as I see products I searched for on google ads extensively. This extension needs finer control options and information separately on ads and trackers, as the built-in controls in Opera or Edge. So far, this extension is only for ads and to my observation, it fails with trackers.
-------------------------
stop
This is "honor-ware" which means it's not free. The lowest price you can pay is $5. False advertising at it's finest. If you don't pay, it will work for two or three days then just stop blocking ads and you have to reinstall it where it asks you for money AGAIN. "free ad blocker"

Good for most websites but blocking youtube ads stopped working recently, so just 3 stars

Adblock Plus is becoming more & more useless by the day as websites keep blocking the extension from working & have adblock detectors, most recently Dailymotion has become another victim of the growing anti-adblock movement, and the day that adblock stops working on YouTube (hasn't happened yet) i will be deleting this extension for good

Worse than useless, every website can detect it, and you have to take the extra step to go turn it off on every site before it loads.  Is this being worked on?

Used to love this adblocker, but recently it's stopped blocking ads. YES, I do still have it turned on.

Huge disappointment after it working so well for so long.

Does not load automatically. Whatever website you go to, it'll load ALL the ADS first, then you need to click the extension to RELOAD the page, and even then it only blocks a few ads. There are always ads on pages that I have used this extension with.

Have had it for years and has worked GREAT, as of the last month Premier Guitar.com website will not allow access to their website till it is disabled, then the screen is so full of ads you only see about 20% of the screen of useful info about guitar content. I rarely use Premier website now.

It's some "blocked by client error" that keeps repeating. This is the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDLli3ljKl0

it can block ads from most sites but, when trying to download something from other sites, example of  heavy loads of ads site like megaup.net, it does block all ads but it can also detect and block the adblocker asking us to disable it first..same as most sites out there.
-------------------------
stop
EDIT: Seems to be working now as it was before.

They updated something that it's blocking too much, most of the websites that use JavaScript just stopped working because it's just blocking the code. This started today, yesterday it was working just fine, even Twitch is no longer working now.

this extension has usually worked OK for me, but in the past few months there's been lots of issues. i've had to disable the extension on google docs, twitter, and now disney+ because it will break the website/make it impossible to use. google docs formatting was totally broken, i couldn't view twitter on desktop at all and disney+ gave me an "error 42" connection error message. they need to fix these issues, i'm considering downloading a different ad blocking extension

Same for me with live videos, disabling the add-on stops the issue.

it works, but it ALSO blocks all 3rd party cookies entirely - so EVERY SINGLE website EVERY page asks over and over if i want to accept or block cookies - my settings one save - only way to stop that is to disable adblock

Breaks all google services. Text is overlapped and only fixed by disabling this extension. Extremely dissapointed

I used this extension and it used to work wonderfully. However, today my google docs mysteriously failed to work properly (the pointer is placed on the beginning of the paragraph and I can't move it), and by elimination, I found that this extension breaks google docs.

bug
I liked it, however some sites like FANDOM or other sites can bypass this, but, that's no match for ABP! You can block the element and completely remove the Ad no matter what
However
Some sites ask you to disable your AdBlocker, and if you block the element, some sites will generate a new one, so it is tricky to bypass those sites who want nothing but to have ads to bug you.
-------------------------

I like Magic Actions for YouTube but occasionally it stops working and it can be frustrating. Right now it keeps eliminating the icon from my YouTube page.

EDIT: Used to be good. Used to be extremely effective. I understand that advertising is a tricky business, but if an adblocker that ADVERTISES itself as an adblocker does not block ads... do I even have to explain how asinine that is? Well, after years of working exactly as intended I noticed that many, MANY ads were getting through on numerous websites. So I reached out to their customer support. I got a reply today... telling me that there are "circumventors." Well if that's the case, then the app needs to evolve to circument the circumventors. If it won't then it isn't doing it's job. So I tried another app. Get AdGuard AdBlocker, everyone.Use it until it stops working and then find a new one. 'Cause I predict that's how this whole thing is going to go. ABP doesn't work anymore. AdGuard works. For now. Welcome to the "Internet Annoyance Arms Race." You're gonna be here for the rest of your life.

If you install the disable JavaScript extension, whenever a site attempts to shame you for having an ad blocker simply disable JavaScript on that site and show them who is boss!  What are you blocking? Under-taxed Google AdSense revenue?  Why should we reward news sites for being lazy and using thoughtless generic ad networks rife with intrusive ads that spy. Disable JavaScript and all the monkey business stops cold.

Best app ever!  Ad free forever....over a decade ad free.  I started using ABP many years ago it's been so long I forget now.  Every time I'm over my parents or a friends house I look at their screens and I cannot believe all the junky flashy pop up ad's that get in their way.  They have lost complete control of how their electronic devices work.  The ad companies have taken over.  Every time I buy a new laptop or pc I download ABP immediately.  Just being without it for those few moments upon startig up a new machine I'm bombarded the second I go to any web site.  Nope not for me.  ABP has stopped all that non sense.  I'm in control of my computers.  No ad's.  No pop up's.    Very easy to use.  Seamless.  Just set it and forget it.  Download and you are all set.  Thank you ABP for all the wonderful years of your wonderful software.  I'm poor and disabled and cant donate a dime but if I was a rich girl you would get a nice donation.  I hope my review makes up for my lack of funds.

i will never install this, even if this was last adblocker out there. it is frustrating to users having no option for them to "auto-reload" page turned on. Whoever clicks to turn off "FOR THIS SITE", surely needs to reload too, and not just it auto-reloads page, but even doesnt have option to allow you. having to spend 2 extra seconds everytime to manually click reload page.

Great most of the time. Blocks annoying ads on most websites, including video ads on YouTube. Unfortunately, some websites have filters that notice when you are using an ad blocker, and so you have to turn it off to load the site. I'm not sure if there are other ad blockers that can sneak past the filters, so this may or may not be ABP's fault.
-------------------------

The application works very well on the pc. It stops almost all ads on youtube.com. However, it is not as good on the iphone. I recommend it to every one.

bug
YOUR EXTENSION HAS COMPLETELY BROKEN GOOGLE CHROME. Literally I constantly have pages get stuck on 'processing request' for like 5 minutes at a time, and after months of searching I found several people on reddit complaining about the same thing and what fixed it for them was deleting adblock plus, and sure enough, the same thing was true for me. I was just now experiencing the 'processing request' bug and once I deleted the extension everything was running smoothly.

In other words, fire your developers! If you can't program a chrome extension without rendering the browser unusable, you shouldn't be writing code for a living :)

Stopped me from having any access to any page.  Forced chrome into a loop of processing request.  Only able to regain access to internet on disabling extension.  Worked fine until yesterday.

-------------------------

Used this for a long time without any issues whatsoever. I would have recommended it to everyone.
But then it started blocking everything. Every single site I visited was blocked from opening.
When you can't get to the sites, there isn't a problem with pop ups right?
If your Chrome stops working, turn off Adblock Plus.
I am trying it once more by installing it again.
If it works ok then I'll edit this. If not, then I'll either write a worse one, or edit this to a lower star rating with some more detail.

***edit***
Re-installing worked although everything is noticeably slower.

The July 1 2020 update breaks Windows 7 and Chrome keeps stuck in "Processing request" on each and every site, while everything is fine in Windows 8 and Win 10.

Otherwise, I suspect will lose MILLIONS of Win7 clients TODAY!

Here is the skinny, I have used this app literally, for years and years now. It has been, by far, hands down the best app I have ever used!  After reading through many of the reviews I totally agree with those who say that people who experience issues with this app are also infected with some type of virus or malware. Now is when I must apologize for the star ratting I have posted because truly LOVE this app! All that said and to fault no other than myself I have just spent the last 15 hours repairing my laptop do to some very evil viruses, to winch I can only pray I have conquered...unfortunately I am now feeling less confident about that because I can not seem to get ABP to block all ads on YouTube, witch is the biggest reason I tout on about you to everyone when ever I am forced to endure a video that someone claims I just have to see!  This is usually someone with a mobile phone who has no clue that you even exist. All of this has brought me to whee I am now. Tired and bury eyed I am hoping that my review will catch the attention of someone who can help me get your app up and running like it used to be. This app is invaluable to me. No Exaggeration. I am hoping that it is something very simple I have failed to see/do because I am so exhausted. Like a setting that was changed or needing to reinstall or a updated I missed? IDK where to begin? I have had many issues with viruses and the like over the many years since I first installed ABP and I have never had an issue with this app being effected like this. Although having it turned off has been a sign that I had problems with something nefarious invading my system but for the most part has been very resistant to being compromised and quickly resolved as soon as the problem had been removed. I sur hope someone who knows the best way to resolve my issue here is able and willing to contact me soon? I am not one to wright reviews, I either uninstall an app if I can't get it to work like I want or I put up with it cause it does what I want good enough but never comment either way, Never do I proceed to writing a short novel as I've done here today. This is outta pure desperation as I did leave a message on your site yesterday as soon as the movie length commercials begain appearing on YouTube videos I was trying to view. Exaggerating a bit I hope you don't mind but it's how I feel. Your icon was and is on in my browser and when it originally happened the " allow acceptable add's box " was checked but correcting that didn't help. Also YouTube was listed under sites that I wanted adds allowed on. I'm a no adds person no exceptions unless the site won't let me proceed unless I allow it and only then will I temporally agree to the minimum and only to access the content I am seeking.
-------------------------

Worked amazingly for a long time. I'm not sure how long its been since I added it to my Chrome. It recently stopped working though. I have to reload the page to activate the add-on every time I open Chrome now, and after I do, any video on Youtube that would have had an ad comes up with a grey screen and an error message. I have to wait the length of time the ad would have been and then the video plays. Not to mention I've been seeing the most ads on all other websites, and some of those the ads still won't go away after reloading the page with the extension. At this point I'm wondering if I should be looking for a new extension.

Great extension. I've had it installed in Chrome for a long time now and after a while you start taking it for granted until you open up YouTube on a different device without an adblocker. You forget how many sites are overflowing with intrusive and obnoxious ads.

However, there is a recent issue with this extension which seems to stem from a change that YouTube has made which throws the following error:

"An error occurred. Please try again later. (Playback ID: ...)"

Hopefully there's a fix or workaround that can be applied by this extension.

Does NOT block ads on Pandora.

2020 Update:
I retried this extension to see if it would fix the errors in YT, maybe it was some sort of issue with Adblock (the original and more efficient ad blocker) slacking off or something. But no, it has the same issue, so I'm re-removing it, as Adblock still does more than ABP ever has.

Also, I find it ridiculous that ABP presented a popup claiming it's blocked 295 ads so far when I haven't used it for more than two videos and this page, and only after I started updating this review. Very misleading and dishonorable, ABP. Shame on you.

Excellent. Works very well. Uses rather a lot of memory, but every time I have to turn it off (because a website forces me to) I hear the CPU fan spin up because of all the extra flashing ads it's loading. Would love if you guys can make it harder for websites to force us to take it off.

It used to be amazing, but over a month ago, on Chrome/Mac it simply stopped blocking the in-feed Facebook ads, which was one of the main reasons I got the externsion to begin with.  Before, when this happened, it would take just a few days for the various lists and all to catch up with whatever changes that Facebook had done to get around the filters, but this time, no such luck, even after weeks and weeks.  Other sites are fine, and even the sidebar ads on Facebook are properly filtered out.  I was hoping today's update would have fixed that, but alas, not.  Until then, I'm looking around for something that will.
-------------------------

I have used this for years so I am not sure if the issues I am having are due to Chrome updates or this extensions updates, but I constantly have to "reload" the page for the extension to work...I contacted them about this and they stated I should update my filters, which I did, and I am having the same issues...I guess it is time to find a new solution to this problem...sad when a favorite extension no longer works...

I've been using Adblock for about 10 years, but lately most of the websites I regularly visit detect Adblock and are forcing you to whitelist or disable Adblock to access their site.  It doesn't even matter if you allow unobtrusive ads.  My use for blocking ads is for security reasons, ads are given to you through 3rd party sites embedded in a page.  I used to give Adblock a solid 5 star rating but they have lost my support because they cannot stop a site from forcing all ads upon you!

i have been using this ad blocker for about a year now and when i first downloaded it, it was working amazing it use to block every ad but now it only blocks ads on YouTube and a couple on games and it never blocks ads on crunchyroll anymore   which is really annoying because it shows 3 to 4 ads in every ad break in the video,
-------------------------
load
Some sites require functionality of things blocked by ad blocker and it's so easy to think a website is broken rather than elements being blocked by adblocker... Particularly, forms and Javascript based buttons.

We can either turn it off or on by default, but when you turn it off, and activate it on a site by site basis, these don't remain blocked. This is a very poor experience, as you battle with ads (eg. the ones that open in new tab) to see content every time you visit the website - of course, it's easy to forget about ad blocker and it is a hassle of loading a site, blocking ads, refreshing the site and remembering not to open any links in a new tab as you'll then have to wait for it to load and add the site to the ad blocker. Until the tab is closed or you leave the website... Then you have to start again.

You use 2x the data doing this. It makes the extension pointless and I have to uninstall it as a result.

Ad block plus is recommended for my PC let's you keep the ads away such as accessing you tube videos and even other pop ups.

Used to work perfectly for years and now its simply stopped working. I have to reload every page I go to get ABP working again. If there is someone out there that knows how to get it working please advise ASAP. Or it might be time to search for a new adblocker .... So sad!

Im not your mom, but I dont think you should use Adblock on Youtube as it stops the content creators you watch from getting ad revenue from your viewing, which they rely on as their primary income. I mean, you just have to watch a 5 second ad to be able to support them.

As I look over all of the reviews left in the past two weeks, my fears have come to light.  My trusted adblock has gone over to the darkside.

Same issues here as others, just bogs down chrome and even cyberfox/firefox.  You don't appreciate just how good this extension is until you disable it and every page hits you with 5000 popups (sometimes literally).  I will say thank you to the developers for so many years of awesome browsing, hopefully it can be fixed, or perhaps it's finally a sign from above to turn off the poisonous social media and go outside.  Oh an LOL to the guy that had trouble loading "the guardian".  Don't worry, their readership is so low they should be insolvent in year or so, so you won't have to read that propaganda anymore anyway :)
-------------------------

The November 14 update has essentially broken this extension, it causes all page loading to cease, and certain pages, like pinterest, to just stop responding while the extension is active. Turning it off and on fixes the issue for a time, but this is, by the reviews, a widespread issue, that needs to be addressed ASAP.

I had the extension for YEARS and just removed it from Chrome today. A few days ago, I noticed websites weren't loading, and I couldn't pinpoint why until I messaged some site's support team and they told me it was my Adblocker. I've disabled Adblock Plus and now websites are loading again. The other annoying thing is that some websites would still tell me to turn off Adblock for their site, which I already had, but I would still not be able to access them. I ended up just removing the extension altogether.

I actually don't know if it's Adblock Plus because I was looking for an alternate Adblock extension and others are complaining of the same thing in their reviews. Please reply if you've found a better replacement.

It says it is waiting for this extension in the bottom bar but it will never load unless i disable and re-enable it which is a pain to have to constantly do.
-------------------------

I've noticed the loading problem starts as soon as I open Gmail. Chrome cannot load any other page. I disabled it on Gmail and seems normalcy has been restored.

I cannot load anything on chrome and I see that people are also experiencing the same problem. I would like to uninstall adblock plus for the time being but i cant uninstall it for now so please fix this issue as fast as possible 
Thank You.

Sorry but I have to uninstall this extension for a while until they fix the new update that prevents me (and apparently other people too) from loading all websites on chrome. I love adblockplus, but I hope the devs fix this ASAP so I can install this again.

This has normally been great but now "waiting for adblock plus" has stopped chrome from connecting to ANY site... my Internet Explorer works but not Chrome with the Adblock Plus Extension.  Very odd.  This just started happening yesterday.  Please fix this great product.

On Nov. 14th. something happened (I assume an update) and it is literally blocking any pages from continuing to load in chrome. It it literally unusable now. The developers need to go back and fix this issue. As the recent reviews show this is a recent event, not just with me.

This used to be great but the latest update broke it. I can't actually select any options in settings anymore.

Just wanted to confirm that Adblock Plus is absolutely getting paid by big companies to let their ads through. After installing a better adblocker the Dove ad (the tab was still loaded) disappeared immediately, as did the various other ads I've seen around (all by large companies). I would be VERY interested in knowing the exact figure the developer is being paid because I would like to know if it's even possible for something like an indie brand to pay to let their ads through. I don't think that should be allowed at all but if the price tag is something an indie brand couldn't afford then that makes it even worse. I would whitelist some smaller sites in order to support content creators and it's mostly indie brands being advertised on those sites which also supported them and I didn't mind that since their ads generally weren't annoying, flashing, loud, etc. However, I did not support big brands (and they didn't need the advertising anyway) and so if the developer's price tag was high then no indie brands would be advertised at all, just the big companies that, again, don't even need the advertising that badly.

The developer has SOLD OUT but I would be very interested in knowing how much it cost for them to let ads through.

I really wanted to give a 5 star to this bad boy. But unfortunately, despite its awesomeness and powerful software to block annoying adds, Adblock Plus forgot an essential feature in their software, the ability to turn off the extension from the extension's icon, which other ad blockers provide. Having so many extensions in the chrome bar, creates the need of easy access to essential features like this. I am disappointed such a powerful software forgot an essential common-sense feature like this.

It's good when it works, but a few sites that have pay-per-click and banner ads found a way to circumvent this Adblocker by blocking us from viewing their content while Adblocks on because it detects us not loading the ads i guess? Is there any way to get around this or something?

uBlock Origin was updated with a bitcoin miner. Don't use uBlock Origin. I'm not going to give away my credentials to make this kind of statement but trust me - I've done my 'research'. uBlock used to be great, until an auto-update loaded it with a rootkit to use your computer as a 'bitcoin miner' - activated first when chrome is launched with uBlock and then Chrome is not needed anymore. If you're reading this review and thinking of switching to uBlock Origin - I'm sad to say as a previous user of it myself - do not.

Updated review:
It has become far too bloated or ???  Pages take forever to load, the Chrome status bar very frequently shows "Waiting for extension AdBlock Plus"

It's slowed my browser so much I've had to disable it.  I now see more ads, but at least the pages load more quickly.  The goal of blocking ads was to speed the loading of pages and other benefits, but it's going the other way now.  Ghostery takes care of some of it, but think I'm off to find a new ad-blocker to replace ABP.

==========
Previous review:
5*
Just excellent!  I've been using it for quite a while and it works so well.  The only problem I seem to have is sometimes Chrome says it's waiting on the ABP extension in the status bar.  I'm not sure if something else is causing that or if it's the extension itself.

I'm even nice to the sites and allow the non-intrusive ads but will block the ones that detect ad-blockers.  Here's the deal - play nice or I don't play at all.  (OK, so some eventually get blocked by Ghostery anyway... continue reading.)

This extension in combination with Ghostery takes care of just about everything I need.  Sometimes I've found I have to whitelist sites in ABP to get them to work.  I use Ghostery to block the rest, along with trackers, but it usually needs some tweaking to allow some sites/features to work correctly.

Can you develop it to be more compatible with yandex browser for android ?
- on google chrome its one of the best ad blocking extensions but still lack the ability to stop unwanted popups pages so I use it in combination with poper blocker extension.
Can you develop it to block popups and popunder pages ?
- I still need to use other extentions like adguard or kaspersky total security integrated extention ( anti banner & private browsing ) to be able to block all ads and unwanted popup pages.
Can you develop it and use advantages of these extensions so I can rely only on your extension for blocking ads, popups and popunders ?

was great when I first got it but after a while it has started causing issues. one issue I've noticed is slight buffering on my vids from time to tome despite having a 100/10 connection(buffering should be possible on that when I'm watching 720/1080p vids) and often adblock will crash and I'm forced to go to extensions and reload it to get rid of adds again. but even with that I'd give it a 3/5 for saving me so much time in videos

This is pretty good and blocks all ads for the most part, however it's far from perfect. I'm not sure if these are things the the developers can fix, but they are minuses against this extension. On certain websites, I find that when Ad Block Plus is on the website won't function properly. For example, On YouTube, if the ad happens to be a YouTube survey, then the video just won't load until Ad Block Plus is off. Another example: DeviantArt. In Notifications and Notes, the links to open the comment chain or note will not work at all until 
Ad Block Plus is off. Those are the only two that I'm aware of, though I'm sure they aren't alone. Another thing, some websites have literally made me redirect to a page telling me to turn Ad Block Plus off until I do so. So Ad Block Plus is 100% useless on those sites. Overall I like it and would recommend it, however these problems can be quite annoying and defeat the purpose to the extension in the first place.

I wish I had gotten this extension sooner. It's amazing. Webpages now load up so much faster, I don't get any blocking messages from my antivirus software regarding potentially questionable advertisements. It even blocks ads on Facebook, although from time to time they still get through. Don't quote me on this, but I think it even prevents ads from playing on the free version of Spotify. At least it seemed like that the last time I used Spotify. The music would stop, but the ads wouldn't play. I just had to hit play on a song, and I was on my way again.

Yes, it does what it says but the in performance cost is high.

With nothing else running on a Chromebook, this takes nearly 400MB of RAM.  On the 2 GB CB I first tested, that limited the size of documents I could handle in Docs, and nearly doubled the loading and scrolling times of a 100 page document.

Switched over to uBlock Origin as wowhead.com (awful site and the reason I first installed ABP years ago) fed me ad after ad that I could not block even after selecting the elements. These were consuming enough bandwidth to keep the page constantly reloading and force the stream I was watching to buffer.

I stuck with ABP and recommended it to friends even when they allowed non-intrusive ads, but it seems they are allowing pretty much everything through now from videos to ads that try to serve you (and would have been successful without my AV) malware.  On multiple PCs I have Acceptable Ads turned off and am still shown acceptable and unacceptable ads. 

I'll gladly return to this company and product if they can return to their former main goal of blocking ads.  Really disappointing.

It blocks maybe one in twenty adds.  It's possible to change it so it works.  Got to go to optional settings and un-check "allow some ads".  Adblock has given in to advertisers and decided to stop blocking to increase it's own revenue.  Unclicking it makes it work as intended.
-------------------------
reload
been a longtime user of Adblock Plus and its Element Hiding Helper, but especially over the past couple of years it has become pretty useless.

the reason? site developers are more savvy and, whereas before if I chose an element in the HTML and blocked it, well now, developers run PHP/javascripts that rotate or substitute content within that <div> or element, so the AdBlock works only for the moment you are on that page. if you reload the page or come back to it, boom, a new ad is there and a new element has taken its place.

meaning that advertisers are more sophisticated than the Adblock developers. seems to me Adblock had a good thing but then just decided to let it ride without keeping up-to-date with what advertisers (many of them lowlife advertisers) would come up with to try to get around the block.

Adblock is now old news. i'm looking for something better, one that will not be outfoxed by PHP or javascripts that rotate ad content on every page load and which are impossible to isolate and block using Adblock's filters -- even ones that i custom-write.

FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!

Advertisers pay to have their ads excluded from this program. Since those ads are able to be shown, it makes webpages load slower and makes you vulnerable to scams. Misses ALMOST EVERY AD/ SCAM.

If anyone you know has this extension, please warn them about this and remove it immediately!

Switched to uBlock Origin and it works like how an ad blocker should.

This was a great addon originally, but it hasn't been working well for me lately. I've had multiple instances of it blocking site functionality, especially on Tumblr (hiding the reblog/like/follow buttons in some layouts, for example), and it never worked on in-video ads on Youtube, that I can recall. I have a different addon called Magic Actions for YouTube that knocked those ads right out, and has a ton of other good features besides. I've also had ABP do weird things like periodically, on a random Youtube vid, continue counting up ads on the ABP badge through the duration of the video, to a ludicrous level (a recent one was at about 4500 on the badge by the time the video ended). A similar bug happens on Tumblr from time to time, where I'm reblogging something and adding my own comments, and the badge ticks up for every single keystroke. But anyway, I'm switching to UBlock Origin at a friend's suggestion, because this is ridiculous.

Saves loading time, gets rid of obnoxious ads, if you're unfortunate enough to get a small piece of adware virus that is tricky to remove without reinstalling windows, this blocks it out. Trouble is theres a few sites that I want to support, but don't want certain obtrusive ads.

It'd really benefit from a reverse-block mode where you can enable certain ads on a page, while blocking others.
But I don't know how much more code that would entail. For that matter, how great would it be to simply block the visual part of the ad; have it where it registers the ad being displayed but doesn't show it visually ----websites still get paid for whatever miniscule pennies an ad is worth, but it simply doesn't show up. Some kinda ghost mode of sorts.

NONE of these various adblocker extensions are working against youtube now,   youtube/Google got stronger in the us-against-them ads battle. That's what's happening here.
I had been using the original AdBlock for a long time with no ads anywhere, then recently youtube videos would show a 'playback error', which was actually a 30 sec ad.     No ad shown but it was running silently, preventing the video play for 30 seconds.  As of yesterday the AdBlock quit working, period, can't access options or anything

Advertising is HUGE money. Adblocker (ABP) was the 1st, and is the biggest ad blocker.
It is true that they have started allowing some static ads (but you can change your settings so it blocks ALL ads).
However, please consider 2 things:
1. Some really good free sites rely on ads to survive. If all ads were blocked on all sites then we would lose loads of great sites on the internet, because they can't cover their costs.

2. It may be smart of ABP to 'work with' websites, and allow them a few small static adverts  (that are non-intrusive). If they always block everything, then sites will just continue to hire programmers/ hackers to block anyone from viewing their content if they use adblockers. E.G. Many sites have already started fighting back against ABP by developing software that DETECTS if you are using ABP, and won't let you view content unless you disable it.
THEN...
There are 2 solutions:

1. Add Anti Adblocker Killer to ABP filter.
OR.
2. You can pause it briefly on that page, then click on what you want to view, then turn ABP back on. You can then view the content after the 1st ad pops up, but there won't be any more ads again. 
(E.G. Some Movie sites that bombard you with hundreds of ads, now say 'disable Adblocker to continue' - So, just pause ABP, click on film, then un-pause ABP. - You will see the 1st advert, but ABP will stop all the other ads once un-paused, and the site thinks it's turned off permanently. (SO NO NEED TO ADD ANTI AB KILLER if you are having trouble doing so. 
N>B:
-Solution 1. is best.
-Solution 2. is for people with basic IT skills, that don't like adjusting the extension's subscription filters.

Personally, I can live with 1, maybe 2 small ads on a free site if it let's the website survive.
Also, I rather ABP 'WORKED WITH" sites to limit ads so that it's reasonable; Otherwise there will be a constant war between the sites /programmers to stop AdBlockers - and we will constantly have to update. 
-------------------------
stop
You will know it is working not only because you stop seeing ads but because some websites will detect it and ask you to pay to read their content.

Lately it makes Chrome run some pages incredibly slowly.  Google sites like YouTube, Drive, and Gmail are almost unusable at times.  Most other sites are also slowed down but not nearly as bad.

I've tested and it's definitely Adblock Plus causing this.  Temporarily disabling it immediately makes sites load, scroll, and interact at normal speed again.  I only have the Easylist filter selected.

It wasn't like this until maybe a month ago.

-------------------------
load
Something has changed recently, as ABP is now causing huge responsiveness issues for a period of time after page loading has apparently completed.

On many sites this unresponsiveness lasts for 5-10 seconds, making the extension more intrusive than the ads it is attempting to block.

During this period, the status bar reads:

"Waiting for extension Adblock Plus..."
or
"Processing request.."

For now, the extension is disabled.

Sadly, it just doesn't work with Chrome on Windows 10. I used it for years on Windows 7. But now that I have upgraded to Win10, Pages load very, very, very slow. I love Chrome, so I'm going to have to look for a another blocker. Sorry guys.

Wow dude, your understand of the internet and how it works is atrocious.  
First of all, the internet is NOT free...we pay ISP's out the butt to access the internet and THAT should be considered our "membership" fee (if you will) when it comes to P2P...but, that's a whole 'nother ball of wax.
Secondly, the "internet" doesn't rely on ad's...the websites rely on ads.  And, truth be told, they don't rely on ads, they just take advantage of the opportunity to sell ad's if they're a popular site.  The more popular the site, the more ad's they sell.

If you somehow have a website that reinserts its ads (even without reloading), after you already reinstalled Adblock Plus, blame the website for its use in obtrusive adverts... although if they use a third-party advert service, that site might have gotten vandalized and could be doing malicious code injections as well.

A few years ago I installed ABP on my Windows 7 laptop. It was awesome: I was able to block ads and also websites, which turned out to be ABP's superhero power, in my opinion.

Facebook? Totally blocked! Local newspaper's site that doesn't moderate its comments (a cesspool of racial epithets)? Gone!

Even if I accidentally clicked on a link-shortened URL that led to a site I wanted blocked, it showed me an error page.

When I recently tried out ABP on my Chromebook, it blocked ads. Ho-hum. But if it wasn't an ad, there was no way to tell ABP about the other things I wanted to block.

So, yeah, it does what the name says. But the secret sauce that made me love it is gone.

Great! I would give it 5 stars, but recently I have been seeing banners on some sites that, even when I use the Block Element feature to block them (it allows you to force an ad or banner to be removed by adding it or it's location on the page specifically to the block list), they pop back up instantly. What is unusual is that when they pop back up (when I have not reloaded or refreshed the web page yet) they show up in a different location on the page (the top left area) until I refresh the page and then they are back to where they were originally and unchanged.

I have used this extension for years and have never had issues like this before. I think companies are finding some ways to prevent Adblock-type extensions from doing their job. I figure that this is something that Adblock Plus will fix or figure out how to get around. I hope so at least or I will have to switch to another extension

Nevertheless, I'm going to look for an alternative.

A very good add-on up until recently. It may be because of Chrome updates but Adblock Plus seems to not entirely work, meaning that when I load a page it either keeps trying to load ads and keeps the page in loading mode or the entire page crashes on me.
-------------------------
stop
it worked for a while but it stopped in a few weeks and all ads and malware was back
-------------------------
error
Been using this extension for years now and it does the job of hiding pesky ads splendidly! But I'm currently having issues with it at the moment as the extension seems to crash when attempting to open a URL in a new tab with Chrome notifying me that it is waiting for a response from Adblock before it continues to load the page. Due to this error I'm having to browse the internet with the extension disabled, which is an awful experience for obvious reasons :(
-------------------------
stop
The thing doesn't work at all now, which is a shame because it was one of the reasons I stopped getting viruses on my computer. Now that it's stopped working, I'm very disappointed. Please fix it.
-------------------------

It suddenly stopped working for unknown reasons.

Fantastic. The only "problem" was when I restarted my computer it stopped working. But all I had to do was get the newer version of chrome

Amazing Add on however has recently stopped blocking a lot of Adverts, especially noticeable on YouTube videos.

I got told off at my company for accidentally promoting another product through use of an advert that played before a YouTube video that I was scheduled to play at a client event in front of about 300 clients :/
-------------------------

Web browsing became much faster with this extension. It turned out it was all the video ads that slowed the browser down in the past. The actual content I was trying to see was in fact fairly quick to load.

it stops ads in any browser

it sometimes just stops working and you have to remove and add it again

Does not work very well for removing ads. many times the ads will still load when first opening webpages. does not do this with other adblock apps.

PLEASE HELP.
I cannot access the options, every time I click on options it stays forever loading or the page just crashes.

It stops working every time I restart Chrome, but when it does work it's very nice to not have the annoying ads.

I just wish that I wouldn't have to re-install it every time I open Chrome. I'm on a Mac, so not sure if that influences anything at all, but because of that I can't use regular Adblock, just Adblock Plus...

It works fairly well but on certain websites (especially YouTube) it slows down my browser and takes forever to load. Hopefully this can be fixed.

Used to stop all ads for me. Now it doesn't block pop-ups and in-your-face ads. :/
-------------------------
stop
Would give one star if I could.

Adblock Plus is horrible. Not only does it serve to make bloggers lose revenue, it also makes bloggers want to charge for their content. After all, bloggers have to make money.

EVER HEARD ABOUT ABP'S CORRUPTION? Eyeo is in bed with big business. They're openly and shamelessly extorting money from large corporations like Google by forcing them to pay large amounts of money to whitelist their "safe" ads. Not as innocent as you thought, eh?

Eyeo claims that bloggers can get their ads unblocked for free, but I've applied with no response from Eyeo for over a year.

The only reason I use AdBlock is to test my anti AdBlock software on my blog!

I'm surprised Google didn't remove ABP from the store yet!

SUPPORT A FREE INTERNET, STOP THE GROWTH OF ADBLOCK!
-------------------------
stop
All in all, it does everything it's supposed to really well.  However, sometimes it gets disabled (empty chrome puzzle piece as opposed to ABP stop sign icon) and I can't figure out why.
-------------------------
stop
It blocks every ad: I don't know what garbage people are writing of how it doesn't work; that is, unless you use the two of the Windows series which ABP doesn't work on.

The application gives off viruses which are PUP Optional registry keys. While these viruses are not a big deal and can also be in Microsoft products they can track you and there's no knowing if they can access personal information like bank accounts. Malwarebytes are a good product to remove these. The virus flow will stop if you remove ABP; that's your choice. I don't care if you say I'm straight up wrong; Malwarebytes picked up these viruses and my other downloads are from known publishers (known to Microsoft).
-------------------------
load
This is wonderful!  The best way to test is to go to your favorite websites, Disable it, see all of the ads, then enable it, click refresh and see the difference.  On some sites it cuts the load time  in half.
-------------------------
stop
Very handy in stopping 99% of those annoying and nasty adds from popping up. But one con is some sites block you if you use it so that can be annoying.
-------------------------
stop
ya its good for blocking ads . But , after few days of using , i found it stops responding or blocks half the ads . .
-------------------------
stop
Too All thoes who said it stopped working reason... Google hates it. They make minor Chrome updates to block ABP constantly.
Reason why it lags is cause they perform updates without you knowing to block this.  It sucks but google relies on revenue from popups and ads places in Youtube(which this blocks and stops). Google hates it with a passion... that is also why ABP was not allowed on the store for about 4 months.

It does work, and it run perfectly fine. Doesnt lag anything at all. If you lag or have problems it is your machine usually from viruses already and crap that has already bogged down your system.

If you get FlashBlock as well and Ghostery too this can solve alot of problems in for you period.
-------------------------

It has stopped working, I dunno why

wrorks great 
but often it stops working so i have to re-install it everytime that happens

Easily half the ads on a given page were let through. Trying to manually block an ad typically resulted in the add reappearing on page reload.

Can't block anything, it's all back as soon as I reload the page.

Good when it works, otherwise, causes chrome to crash constantly and sometimes shows nothing on certain tabs, even when I reload. This is fixed for me by opening the same link in another tab.

This extension seems to block most annoying ads. However, it also brings my browser to a grinding halt at times. I see a message in the status bar saying "Waiting for AdBlock". Ugh. Even on a blank "about" page it takes forever to load. So I'm going to uninstall for now.
-------------------------

This was working fine for a long time but recently it's started popping up at random times even when Chrome isn't open and saying that it has been installed. I've reinstalled it three times now hoping that would stop it. Here goes the fourth time...

Why are you running your code on my web pages when I've told ABP not to run on that domain? Shouldn't you be able to see that the domain is blacklisted and NOT inject your js?

You are throwing errors in my console. Stop it.

Happens 4 times:

Uncaught ReferenceError: ext is not defined include.postload.js:539

Fix it and I'll update my rating accordingly.

This is my first day using this app but it is restoring my sanity.  My chrome page started playing video commercials at the bottom. I didn't know they were there at first but I could hear them load. The Adblock Plus app blocked them all, even removed requested to visit other games, I didn't even realize these were adds. It removed the stalker adds on the right side as well, I'd visit a shopping site and it would  give me adds of what I viewed (spoiling the gift surprise for my sis who uses my computer).  I tried removing history and cookies but that did not stop it. This app blocks & Goes Above and beyond what I expected!

bug
It works marvelously, blocking all of the ads on any website.
However, it seems to have a bug or something. It's doing a rather annoying "on again, off again" sort of thing where it only blocks the ads half the time. I've had to uninstall and re-install because of this several times.
-------------------------
stop
i love it. it would be great if it stopped popups so i don't have to install another extension. 

Also it does not have a 'undo' of the last filter. so if you filter something by mistake, it is time consuming to delete that filter. you have to find it and you have to know which one it is.
-------------------------

It's a good app. but after few month it stop work..so i m a little unsatisfied with this app.

The only thing I dislike is that it just stopped working. No matter what I do it just doesn't block ads anymore.
-------------------------
stop
it didn't block or stop adds   a useless program
-------------------------
break
Very hit or miss with video ads, just as likely to make the content fail to play as it is to successfully block the ad. Would still be at least 4 stars if it would just fail silently in those situations, but it's the only extension I routinely have to disable because it breaks things.
-------------------------
load
With this add-on enabled, many pages time-out on load, or half the content doesn't load, leaving broken pages. Ads are effectively removed, but make my entire browsing experience a bit degraded.
-------------------------
stop
It stopped working for me after awhile.
-------------------------
stop
Allows so-called 'acceptable ads' (non-intrusive, clearly marked ads). This setting is on by default, which is why some reviews will tell you that this plugin "does not work totally / stopped working". Just go to settings to get rid of all ads.
-------------------------
bug
it worked for a while but then it didn't. i always had to delete it then upload again but now it won't work after that, hopefully it's just a bug
-------------------------
access
I installed this extension due to the annoyance of all pop-up ads on the lower and right sides of my screen. It seemed to work well as far as that went, but for some reason I was unable to access Facebook AT ALL after 2 days of having it installed. I removed it and Facebook was accessible. 

Ads wouldn't be so bad if they weren't so obnoxious. When they interfere with my ability to see/read content on certain websites, they get annoying. If the sites that depend on ads to operate would make them less annoying, people wouldn't seek out extensions like ABP to filter them out.

Unfortunately, these extensions are garbage. They always seem to do more or less than advertised or desired.
-------------------------

Just installed it 5 mins ago. Went to youtube and clicked loads of random videos; not one add appeared. Usually need to skip ad after 5 seconds or close an ad box while watching a video. Good so far....

This extension bogs down your pages so badly, many times they wont load. At least with ads, they loaded.

Immediately stopped ads on youtube and other sites that I visit. Much better browsing now on my chromebook :)
-------------------------

It was working fine for the past year, then a few  months ago it stopped working. Found a solution  and it started working again. Now, for the past week, ads have been popping up everywhere no matter the website. Some days Adblock works fine, then ads start showing up again, and the cycle repeats itself. It's getting rather frustrating.
-------------------------
stop
A must have for any internet users. I recommend it for older internet users as a way to reduce the number of ways they can get a virus, see scams, etc. For me, it has saved me many hours on Youtube, as I already see enough unskippable ads on TV. 

Sometimes I see a few Facebook ads that are partially blocked. You may have to update the subscription lists manually sometimes. (A quick way to get to that is to right click on the stop sign icon and click Options.) That's really the only negative thing I can say about it, and it's a minor one at that.

EDIT: A recent update added a way to block social sharing buttons, which streamlines loading even more for users with a slow connection, and cleans up a little more unnecessary clutter.
-------------------------

Whenever Chrome gets updated, Adblock Plus stops working. I then have to uninstall (loosing my settings) then add it once more along with my settings.

Please give us an export/import option if possible.

This extension doesn't even work. The only thing it does is actually make more ads show up, and make my pages load very slow.

to everyone who says it stopped blocking ads, just go to its settings and download a pack of urls to block.

It used to work really well and blocked unwanted ads on all of the sites that I visited, but lately it has stopped working all together. All of my sites have ads again, it's like it's just a red dot on the screen now, not an actual functioning app. I'm disappointed

Blocks alot of ads but you still need other extensions as well, if you want to block others.
More and more ads are bypassing this every day, especially on forums & social sites & still showing up.
There's a block element option to try & block the rogue ads, but most places know when you're using it & just reload, rendering the option useless.
Alot of sites are detecting adblock/adblock plus too & wont load unless you disable it first, like itv player & other tv sites.

Adblock Plus is quite a useful plugin that disabled annoying advertisement. Though, as much as I enjoy not seeing ads, websites that can be accessed easily will not be able to gain revenue from the people who use Adblock.

This, at one time, was great. It really does block just about every ad- you dont even see the ones in between moves on words with friends. But. The but in this case is that Adblock Plus has a bug. There are numerous site where if you try to use your "back" button, you find that your history has been filled with one website- The only way to navigate back at this point is to retype your search/address, our open your full history. If you are lucky enough to figure it out early, pressing and holding the back button to open the short list EVERY time you navigate back will stop the repeated duplication, but thats a pain. This is rated at 2.5 stars. It does work great to block ads, but the cost is not worth the benefit. Find another on to use till this one gets fixed.

I loved this extension for the 1 week when it blocked Facebook ads. Then it stopped working ... again. Last time this happened, it took over a month to get the extension to block those ads

I had this work on my computer for months straight, but now it doesn't work. I haven't fiddled with the installation or Easylist. I just unchecked "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" to try to fix this an hour ago and I'm still getting Yputube video ads. So why did it stop working?
-------------------------
stop
Stopped blocking youtube ads. I almost went deaf since stupid ads seem to be 10x louder than normal content.

[EDIT] Found the problem in my settings:

Every time I disable pepperflash in Chrome ALL the ads come back to youtube, also many vids are broken, taking 5-6 refreshes to play the video (audio sometimes mixes, original + ads on top)

Why do I disable pepperflash you ask? I have a 5.1 surround system set up and disabling pepperflash is the only way to make chrome use all 5.1 channels.

My online life has been a nightmare. I have to chose between listening to online audio as it where in silly laptop speakers or be plague with endless ads and broken vids.

For the love of God, may this piece of info be useful in finding a solution.

I would've rated 5 stars, but AdBlock Plus doesn't really work alone.  I tried it as my only ad blocker, but ads still got through -as well as popups.  But once I got regular AdBlock alongside Plus, the popups and ads stopped.  Wish it would've worked on its own.  Also doesn't block those annoying, bright blue ads on Tumblr.

Stopped working, not blocking anything

I just installed it worked great, until I tried to load the casino games on Facebook.  It can't tell the difference between a pop-up and a game loading.  I like the games more that I'll put up with the ads. But Adblock+ is gone.

This worked amazingly until very recently where, like many other reviews say, it has suddenly stopped working, almost entirely. It is now an adblocker that does not block ads. I have tried everything I could find on google to improve, and nothing works. Uninstalling for now, i'll check back in a month or so, in the hopes you actually fix this BS.
-------------------------

It worked...until lately. It blocks a lot of ads but not everything. I still get pop-up ads at some sites (the dangerous ones that try to instantly download .exe files to your computer without asking the second the page loads). What irks me most of all is that it does not WHATSOEVER block the annoying ads and commercials on YouTube. I hate that and is why I want an ad blocker!!!! In the past it used to block them entirely but now not at all >:/ I would switch to another app if I found one that blocked the ads on YouTube. I find that 100% intolerable. I LOATHE ads!

bug
Used to love Adblock Plus  but recently it just isn't working, spending more time reinstalling because support can't do anything about the bugs where ads manage to slip pass the blocks. changing to ad block pro.
-------------------------
stop
Totally stopped blocking banner ads and sidebar ads. I added the elements to ABP, which I didn't have to do before, and when I returned to the website the same ads, women with big jiggly boobs and a host of scantily clad women having fun (really. Are you that desperate?) Going back to AdBlock. Sucks because this one *was* superior.
-------------------------
stop
It seems to block things for a few days then stops  working on any site.  Right now it's not blocking ads on Facebook, Yahoo, or Youtube, (and pretty much any other site).  Will probably remove if this isn't fixed soon.

Last few days it stopped working for me and everyone I know. used to be a much needed add on but now it blocks one pop up out of ten... I just started using "add blocker" and things just got back to normal. Going to be giving them money now just hope they don't send me poems.

For those of you that had it stop working recently (like I did), I was able to fix it like this:  Go to chrome://extensions.  under Adblock Plus, click Options.  A new tab will open.  In the Filter Lists section, click +Add Filter Subscription.  By default it will fill with EasyList.  Click +Add.  It should be working again now.  Not sure why that got cleared out in the first place, but at least it can be fixed!

It is really good while it works, but last week it stopped working for some unknown reason so I had to use another blocker.

Either websites are getting smarter about making it so adblockers don't work, the app itself has a glitch or Chrome broke it, it's not working correctly

It was actually great, up until last week, when it suddenly stopped working. i uninstalled it and then installed it again and again AND again but it made no difference, even when I added the filter subscription- it would suddenly stop blocking ads that needed to be blocked. It makes its own choices and blocks very rarely when it may want to. A very weird case! It really is a shame because it was AMAZING for months. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars. Please fix it if you can. Thank You. :)

It regularly needs to be re-installed. If I don't it stops blocking any ads. This is a problem that needs to be fixed. The filters are also incredibly broken and don't actually block what should be blocked. This is still better than alot of the other options unfortunately.

It used to work but not it seems like it always deletes the lists or deletes adblock altogether (from my browser) when I reload my browser.

Now that Adblick Plus has sold out to Google, i've instinctively clicked on the link at the top of the search result, giving me a virus. After a reformat I am back. Google has conveniently taken away any color or text differentiation between results and adss with ads that often directly mock actual products. This results in viruses being loaded on our machines.  Seriously....sucks.

Adblock doesn't work for youtube anymore because Google paid the developers of adblock to stop blocking their site.

I don't blame Google. They're paying money for the right to show ads which should be their right to begin with. The ABP creators, however, are hypocritical and thieving. I remember watching all their nonsensical propaganda about "Freeing the web of ads" and asking for donations to support their work.

"Failed, download failure"
and I can't find a fix in the chrome help search. 
So, it works for one day... and then it stops working, and I have to uninstall and re-install. I gave it two stars because when it does work, it works perfectly.  Seems to my there is probably an application compatibility problem, and this seems par for the course with crashy Chrome. Hey look... I don't have this problem in Firefox!

It just stops sometimes. all ads show up all of a sudden, then gotta re-install it.

Up until literally two days ago, I would have rated this extension 5*'s, no doubt. It's my favorite extension ever, really. But then two days ago, it just stopped working altogether.

And judging by other user reviews, this is not a private problem, but one that multiple users share.

Stopped working? Loved this on Firefox,never a problem, but had to switch to chrome due to flash crashing on every page. Less than a month, now no ads are blocked, and setting up a filter for every ad is not useful. Installing regular adblock and adblock for youtube to see if that helps.

Dear all, 

My name is Job Plas, and I am the Project Manager for Adblock Plus. Due to a bug, YouTube video ads have been showing for everyone using an adblocker (not only Adblock Plus).

We're happy to announce that we fixed this, and that Adblock Plus is now the only Chrome extension which blocks all annoying YouTube video ads again!

Happy browsing from the ABP team :) 

Best,

Awsome blocks all adds,

only bad thing is it leaves the outline but still 5 stars :D

I liked it for a long time then happened to use a filtered connection for a while, this extension crippled all of Chrome! No pages (even chrome config pages) are allowed to load unless Adblock Plus connects to its servers and if that's impossible then you can wait forever!
Suggestion: add a timeout option at least, after which the page load would go on without filtering the contents...

I really loved adblock, but suddenly it completely stopped working. ads are pouring in!! its enabled yet it is no longer providing the service i loved. for over 6 months i swore by this ap and rescued many friends and family from unwanted advertising. have the ad companies bypassed it? or is adblock making money from advertising companies?
-------------------------

Adblock stopped working ??!??!!!!?!?!
-------------------------

Ads still get through, they are just more subtle. Like words will turn to click through links to ads. All you have to do is make a mistake and hoover over the word and the ad pops up. I think that's more annoying than blatant banners. Basically pick your poison, but either way there is no stopping the ads.
-------------------------

It worked wonders and then it stopped working

Gonna have to let this go until they update it.  Some sites are getting savvy to adblock users and using this breaks WHOLE SITES.  Livestream?   it lets only the chat load, keeps the video from loading, and a few others won't let anything load at all.

Hands down one of the best extensions available. Blocks YouTube ads, search ads, dashboard ads, Pandora ads (on and off), ads of literally every single type. The one improvement that could be made is some way to show if a full-page ad has been blocked; it is sometimes unclear whether a large ad is blocked or the page simply fails to load.

This really does work and i love it, but the past few days it had just stopped working and i cannot figure out why
-------------------------
stop
I know the subject of blocking ads can be a touchy subject but the truth is that without an ad blocker some sites can be dangerous, unusable and sometimes offensive without an blocker so I enabled for these types of sites and disable it for sites I wish to support and whose ads aren't offensive. Just a word of warning Google if you try the same trick as what you have done in the Google play store I'll be moving back to Firefox and removing adblockers from play store hasn't stopped me blocking ads on my android device it made me more determined to and downloaded the app from elsewhere , you don't own my android device I DO and I'll use an adblocker on it if I wish to.

It used to be one of the most important extensions for me, but there is unfixed bug with "got back" in chrome which makes it absolutely unusable.

I'm getting annoyed with having to reload a webpage so that the content will show up correctly. Most of the time, a page will load and there will be just text, no formatting.

It does its job - it blocks ads on Facebook - but it also prevents you from using the 'Back' button to retrieve your previous page, and instead continues to reload your current page.

On some sites, it creates havoc as the page tries to load causing a flash that will induce epileptic seizures.

I'm using Chrome and Windows 7 - and had to disable Adblock the first day I installed it.

This is a great extension for Chrome when it comes to blocking ads on every website. However, there is a HUGE problem with this extension. After a week or so with this installed, Youtube videos load a lot slower. So you might want to disable it if you're having trouble loading Youtube videos.

No good.

This used to be a great plugin but two massive, long-standing bugs prevent me from using this:

- browser history gets corrupted on many popular sites

- adding CSS styles in the Dev Tools doesn't work when ABP is installed

These bugs have been here for months now and no devs have responded to the forum posts about these. As far as I'm concerned this extension has been abandoned.

There is a problem with Adblock Plus saving filters and its continual pop-up page and ALWAYS defaulting to allowing Google ads and Adblock Plus don't seem to want to fix it.

This issue has been addressed by saying it's a known issue, this file is corrupted, go and delete etc. If it's a known issue then FIX IT or say why it can't be fixed.  I and a whole load of other people reported it 10 months ago, back in March and it is now December. I find that unacceptable.

Useful is an understatement. AP has become a dear companion sparing me loads of nonsense ads and upping the loading speed of web pages(a bit..). If a web page doesn't respond well (can't load or similar) I just disable AP or set my own custom filters for that website. Thanx dudes you shine ~d(-_-)b~

The best solution for blocking ads but there is a annoying bug with it. Sometimes it causes the CSS of a website not to load, I'm using the latest version of Chrome - 22.0.1229.96 m

Does what it's supposed to do, but leaks memory like nobody's business.

Repro:

1. Open up any webpage in a tab with Adblock Plus enabled.
2. Open up the Chrome task manager and watch that tab's memory usage.
3. Refresh the tab multiple times, waiting for it to load before refreshing again.
4. Watch that tab's memory usage go up, up, up, up.
5. Try the same thing after disabling this extension.

It does a great job of blocking most ads. Needs to add in the ability to block overlays, and it's Facebook ad blocking is hit and miss.

Also, since updating, I keep getting pop-ups every time I start my browser about how it just updated. I don't care. Stop pestering me. That's why I got this extension...

Latest update (13) now won't stop displaying new tab saying that it has updated. Annoying as f#ck

I hate ads. AdBlock Plus stops advertisers wasting my screen space and bandwidth. Thank you for an excellent, free extension.

Btw, I'm one of the people who hates all ads, so I opted out of the acceptable/non-intrusive ads in the latest version.

ok so this JUST updated and right away its crap on youtube, it brings up a google chrome error saying "This webpage was blocked by an extension.

Sadly doesnt work when playing cartoon network games.... they just wont load
-------------------------

Where do I start?

Well for starters, just because you can't see ads doesn't mean it's blocked... If anything this should just be called AdViewBlock. Ads still load companies still get the info they want, your info. 

People say "This is super fast and low cpu", thats because its NOT DOING anything, it's just not letting you see an ad that is STILL THERE.

AdBlock on the other hand actually blocks the ads from loading, sure on some sites it takes - seconds to completely block but its a small price to pay for actual ad free browsing compared to this AdBlock Plus nonsense. 

About 1.5-2.3 million of the people who got AdBlock Plus only clicked/downloaded it because they though the guy who made AdBlock made this; this is NOT the case. I really hate how the name is AdBlock Plus as it implies that it is some upgraded version.

AdBlock:
-Different Developer
-Actually blocks ads not just hide them
-Perfect for anyone and shows high cpu usage on few sites and even then the waiting period is short

AdBlock Plus:
-Does NOT block ads only hides them
-Companies still get your information
-Low cpu usage
-Useful for people who just want to not see ads but not block them
-The name is a pitiful lie

I only give this 2 starts instead of one because it may be more useful for people not looking not block ads, just not view them.

That is my report.


Cheers.

Much better than the other 'AdBlock' extension. This one has been around for a very long time, and gets 99% of ads, and who cares about the rare ones that might pop up. The 'AdBlock' version uses a very sluggish method, and cannot display pages  correctly until after it is fully modified. It also increases cpu usage significantly and will drink up netbook batterys like gaterade. This is the best choice for almost every situation. Webpages load FASTER due to less work being done, not slower due to the method the other one uses.

I (Chrome 16.0.912.77 m; Win 7) have been using this now for a very long time. Until recently it seemed a perfect ad-blocker (=5 stars rating). However, since a couple of weeks the ads on many of the websites I visit regularly (very popular ones) are not blocked but shown as if Adblock Plus (Beta) would not have been installed (= this is, why I have to subtract one star). When I manually update the filters, everything is ad free again. However, I do not want do that over and over again. What is wrong? Is that a known bug? Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks!

This plugin has completely stopped working for ads from certain sources.

If you install the disable JavaScript extension, whenever a site attempts to shame you for having an ad blocker simply disable JavaScript on that site and show them who is boss!  What are you blocking? Under-taxed Google AdSense revenue?  Why should we reward news sites for being lazy and using thoughtless generic ad networks rife with intrusive ads that spy. Disable JavaScript and all the monkey business stops cold.

i liked it its not bad but there is some problems to fix, in some sites javascript ads still exist, the javascript ads looks like the "CONGRATULATIONS YOU WON!" or some poker stuff, and also the adblock should block reddit promotions because it seems annoying to me because i see it everywhere, and ads still showing up in fandom, and some sites using the block adblock script for their scam website, its annoying because who knows the site is filled with ad trackers, and the others? this extension is amazing! now i don't need to see trash ads that shouldn't belong, there should be an adblock for android but for youtube, i know they made an adblock, but its a browser, i wanted that adblock can block games ads and youtube ads (for android)  ads on youtube android is more trasher, so thats why i want adblock for youtube (and games) ads can be blocked without using airplane mode

I've been using Adblock for about 10 years, but lately most of the websites I regularly visit detect Adblock and are forcing you to whitelist or disable Adblock to access their site.  It doesn't even matter if you allow unobtrusive ads.  My use for blocking ads is for security reasons, ads are given to you through 3rd party sites embedded in a page.  I used to give Adblock a solid 5 star rating but they have lost my support because they cannot stop a site from forcing all ads upon you!
-------------------------
javascript
Some sites require functionality of things blocked by ad blocker and it's so easy to think a website is broken rather than elements being blocked by adblocker... Particularly, forms and Javascript based buttons.

We can either turn it off or on by default, but when you turn it off, and activate it on a site by site basis, these don't remain blocked. This is a very poor experience, as you battle with ads (eg. the ones that open in new tab) to see content every time you visit the website - of course, it's easy to forget about ad blocker and it is a hassle of loading a site, blocking ads, refreshing the site and remembering not to open any links in a new tab as you'll then have to wait for it to load and add the site to the ad blocker. Until the tab is closed or you leave the website... Then you have to start again.

You use 2x the data doing this. It makes the extension pointless and I have to uninstall it as a result.

Y'all need to update to block Facebook sponsored ads. If this issue gets solved, I'll give this add-on 6 stars. All of those who advertise are big companies and can survive without ad revenue. Ain't gonna give another short doses of attention just to give those companies' CEOs their third Aruban mansion.

Injects malware javascript to every page that is loaded breaking them. Very bad. Avoid this.

Yeesh. Of course it's still working - generally. 
Websites change things that break the 3rd party extensions. You hope that the developer can update their extension to make it work again... and in a short time. But, it's not fair to downrate the whole app

IT IS BROKEN! DO NOT GET THIS EXTENSION.

"Allow some non-intrusive advertising": more like "allow most intrusive advertising and very little non-intrusive advertising"!

Also, I tried to contact support, but there's some sort of document that I cannot contact support about this issue without agreeing to. If it were negotiable, then I would take it there first; it is not, and it has some egregiously invasive (and outright false; "[...] this information will not be disclosed to any third party without your consent [...]" yet I am not given the option whether to consent to some other forum user accessing my post; heck, I'm not even notified of it!) terms.

After a brief stint with uBlock, I'm back to ABP because it does a much better job at blocking elements of a page than uBlock does. The fail part of ABP is it's ability to block pop-ups. uBlock did a much better job and to supplement ABP's element blocking ability, I've had to install a 3rd party extension (Poper Blocker) to do the job ABP keeps choosing not to block. I may need to find a different solution than to use two extension to do the job of what what claims it can do both.
-------------------------
javascript
been a longtime user of Adblock Plus and its Element Hiding Helper, but especially over the past couple of years it has become pretty useless.

the reason? site developers are more savvy and, whereas before if I chose an element in the HTML and blocked it, well now, developers run PHP/javascripts that rotate or substitute content within that <div> or element, so the AdBlock works only for the moment you are on that page. if you reload the page or come back to it, boom, a new ad is there and a new element has taken its place.

meaning that advertisers are more sophisticated than the Adblock developers. seems to me Adblock had a good thing but then just decided to let it ride without keeping up-to-date with what advertisers (many of them lowlife advertisers) would come up with to try to get around the block.

Adblock is now old news. i'm looking for something better, one that will not be outfoxed by PHP or javascripts that rotate ad content on every page load and which are impossible to isolate and block using Adblock's filters -- even ones that i custom-write.

Downloaded this in the hopes that it would stop third party add on from putting themselves on my computer which I started to get frequently after going on holidays overseas.
Didn't stop the third party installers such as Bettersurf plus, but keeps annoying side ads at bay.

It works so well, it sometimes blocks javascript that are needed to run the page.  When that happens, I just turn it off for that page. I wish it had an easy way to whitelist URLs.

Have only tested it for a few days, but no issues found so far.  It stopped the most annoying animated and video adds on my favorite sites and also handled gmail.  But most importantly it blocked the third & fourth party pop in adds that would partially load and hang my Chrome browsers. No browser hangs or crashes since installing.
-------------------------
third
I've had it for about 3 weeks now, It worked wonders when it was in order. Not sure if its going through an update currently, but its starting to mess up on my browser. The ads that are blocked show a square that says something along the lines of "This ad has been blocked by a third party extension", and it will disappear, and reappear rapidly almost blinking that square over, and over again slowing down my browser. (Hoping it fixes soon)
-------------------------

Works very well! The only problem I've had with it is that it starts jumping all over the place when I go to my page on youtube, saying "This page was blocked by an extension" and "A third party extension has blocked access to this web page". They always disappear when I disable it. Reappears when it's enabled again... Other than that, I'm very glad to have it. C:

I LOVE ABP for ten years now. Until YouTube stopped allowing my comments over their advertisements I never saw another advertisement. I swore off Chrome when they sent me (and my wife) dating sites. I asked them to stop but then they started sending gay sites. I turned off everything chrome years ago until recently. Now, if I don't allow advertisements my comments are stopped. I'm very old and getting away from all of this _ _. I just learned about Firefox however, PEACE!

Was working good, now it either doesn't block ad's on Fox News or it does and it doesn't allow you to scroll down the page. I have reported this several times and nothing gets fixed. I end up having to turn it off on any page I look at for Fox News. This also happens on CNN.

GREAT SO FAR, SOME HOW AD BLOCKER WAS TURNED OFF AND ADS WERE EVERYWHERE, THIS STOP IT!

manual
Most pages still show ads, even with it "operational". I can manually block the ads by using the manual block tool but that seems to defeat the purpose of the ad-blocker. Also, so many websites detect ABP and make you disable it in order to view their page, so you end up turning it off anyways and seeing adds. Either way, I see ads on 90% of the pages I visit, either because I'm forced to disable ABP to see the page or it just doesn't do its job.

Great most of the time. Blocks annoying ads on most websites, including video ads on YouTube. Unfortunately, some websites have filters that notice when you are using an ad blocker, and so you have to turn it off to load the site. I'm not sure if there are other ad blockers that can sneak past the filters, so this may or may not be ABP's fault.

Used this for a long time without any issues whatsoever. I would have recommended it to everyone.
But then it started blocking everything. Every single site I visited was blocked from opening.
When you can't get to the sites, there isn't a problem with pop ups right?
If your Chrome stops working, turn off Adblock Plus.
I am trying it once more by installing it again.
If it works ok then I'll edit this. If not, then I'll either write a worse one, or edit this to a lower star rating with some more detail.

Here is the skinny, I have used this app literally, for years and years now. It has been, by far, hands down the best app I have ever used!  After reading through many of the reviews I totally agree with those who say that people who experience issues with this app are also infected with some type of virus or malware. Now is when I must apologize for the star ratting I have posted because truly LOVE this app! All that said and to fault no other than myself I have just spent the last 15 hours repairing my laptop do to some very evil viruses, to winch I can only pray I have conquered...unfortunately I am now feeling less confident about that because I can not seem to get ABP to block all ads on YouTube, witch is the biggest reason I tout on about you to everyone when ever I am forced to endure a video that someone claims I just have to see!  This is usually someone with a mobile phone who has no clue that you even exist. All of this has brought me to whee I am now. Tired and bury eyed I am hoping that my review will catch the attention of someone who can help me get your app up and running like it used to be. This app is invaluable to me. No Exaggeration. I am hoping that it is something very simple I have failed to see/do because I am so exhausted. Like a setting that was changed or needing to reinstall or a updated I missed? IDK where to begin? I have had many issues with viruses and the like over the many years since I first installed ABP and I have never had an issue with this app being effected like this. Although having it turned off has been a sign that I had problems with something nefarious invading my system but for the most part has been very resistant to being compromised and quickly resolved as soon as the problem had been removed. I sur hope someone who knows the best way to resolve my issue here is able and willing to contact me soon? I am not one to wright reviews, I either uninstall an app if I can't get it to work like I want or I put up with it cause it does what I want good enough but never comment either way, Never do I proceed to writing a short novel as I've done here today. This is outta pure desperation as I did leave a message on your site yesterday as soon as the movie length commercials begain appearing on YouTube videos I was trying to view. Exaggerating a bit I hope you don't mind but it's how I feel. Your icon was and is on in my browser and when it originally happened the " allow acceptable add's box " was checked but correcting that didn't help. Also YouTube was listed under sites that I wanted adds allowed on. I'm a no adds person no exceptions unless the site won't let me proceed unless I allow it and only then will I temporally agree to the minimum and only to access the content I am seeking.

It works well, and I especially love the "block element" feature, which allows you to manually block images (and other elements, like iframes) on any page.  I do have a couple complaints about this feature, however...

1. It would be nice if your personal filters (i.e. the images, etc. you have blocked manually) were synced to your Chrome account.  They are not.  The same items need to be blocked all over again on any new device, despite using the same Chrome account.

2. If personal filters can't be synced, at least make it easier/more automated to save an upload a personal filter list.

3. If you block the wrong element accidentally, it would be nice if it were quick and easy to undo the mistake, without having to go into settings.  For example: an option to see all blocked elements, but have them marked, and be able to click "unblock" on an individual one.

4. It seems this feature is not available at all on the mobile device version of AdBlock.  Would be nice to see that corrected.

Does NOT block ads on Pandora.

2020 Update:
I retried this extension to see if it would fix the errors in YT, maybe it was some sort of issue with Adblock (the original and more efficient ad blocker) slacking off or something. But no, it has the same issue, so I'm re-removing it, as Adblock still does more than ABP ever has.

Also, I find it ridiculous that ABP presented a popup claiming it's blocked 295 ads so far when I haven't used it for more than two videos and this page, and only after I started updating this review. Very misleading and dishonorable, ABP. Shame on you.

Absolutely totally worthless. It used to be good - a few years ago. But now, pretty much every major site has adblock blockers. So you go to the site, they put up a screen blocking your view and telling you you can't visit the site until you turn Adblock Plus off.

So what good is an ad blocker that can be so easily blocked!?  It's no good at all. If they don't develop some kind of stealth mode they're gonna be put outta business pretty soon.
-------------------------

Use incognito mode, or hit "no thanks"


If you still can't, there's nothing wrong with the adblocker, it's a problem with the website being garbage. 

Many people still use this adblocker and like it, because they don't regularly visit sites that require you to turn it off. Adblock+ is doing exactly its job, the only reason that the website forces you to turn it off is because Adblock+ is otherwise so diligent that the site gets no ad revenue.

Chromebooks and other google devices profit off of the ads, because they make more people  use google to make websites. The more websites, Google gets more web traffic, and profits. It would be nice to have in every computer, but it won't for the simple reason that ads are good for google.

So far, I've been saved so much time, having ads blocked helps hugely, though... the biggest issue for me personally, and possibly the only issue with this extension, is sometimes, even on YouTube, it doesn't allow you to manually block any elements that were leftover from the automatic ad cleanse on the site you're at. This makes it so, ads can get through, and you have literally NOTHING you can do to make the adblock recognize it, and you're stuck having to deal with it. If there is one thing I need this to change on, it is having full control at all times. 

On a side note: I see comments and reviews about this thing being a crypto miner, if there is any solidity to this claim, PLEASE notify me and let me know.

Absolute garbage. This used to be a great adblocker but they sold out and now allow "some" ads. Supposedly you can check off whether to allow "acceptable" ads but checking that box in the settings doesn't seem to actually do anything.

Isn't pop-up blocking pretty much a default (either as simply built-in, or as setting that may be on or off by default) in pretty much any decent browser (including some fringe browsers, desktop or mobile and even most text browsers - I'm betting at least ELinks probably has even option for this - Links, Links 2, eww (actually not text-only, it's a browser for eMacs, which can be ran in terminal as well as GUI window), w3m (which also has an eMacs front end that also shows images, even though w3m is basically a text browser - but it has ability to show images with colored block characters, if enabled. How many pixels one character is in width and height can be set, because using one character per pixel would easily fill the whole terminal even with small image - so far I prefer w3m in eMacs, although apparently eww is written in pure eLisp and is thus native eMacs application; people need to understand that comparing eMacs with other "editors" and "IDE's" is that it may be the main use of eMacs, but it's really an all-capable OS within an OS), they all probably have pop-up blocking either by default or as an option.

I'm pretty certain Chrome and Chromium has had this for a long time, has it not? I'm not checking right now, but I'm surprised if not. If it had not though, I'm sure the most common ad-block lists already block ad popups anyway, thus leaving only actual purposeful pop-up's (which seem to have been disappeared, as people can do this more user-friendly way by showing so-called "in-page pop-up's", like maybe login window, and because this way the browser doesn't block they log-in window from opening :D ).

Is there something I'm misunderstanding with what you mean by "pop-up blocker"?

Same issues here as others, just bogs down chrome and even cyberfox/firefox.  You don't appreciate just how good this extension is until you disable it and every page hits you with 5000 popups (sometimes literally).  I will say thank you to the developers for so many years of awesome browsing, hopefully it can be fixed, or perhaps it's finally a sign from above to turn off the poisonous social media and go outside.

The November 14 update has essentially broken this extension, it causes all page loading to cease, and certain pages, like pinterest, to just stop responding while the extension is active.

I had the extension for YEARS and just removed it from Chrome today. A few days ago, I noticed websites weren't loading, and I couldn't pinpoint why until I messaged some site's support team and they told me it was my Adblocker.

The other annoying thing is that some websites would still tell me to turn off Adblock for their site, which I already had, but I would still not be able to access them. I ended up just removing the extension altogether.

I actually don't know if it's Adblock Plus because I was looking for an alternate Adblock extension and others are complaining of the same thing in their reviews. Please reply if you've found a better replacement.

Love this but starting on the 14th. it is crashing Chrome daily.   Memory usage goes sky high.

That generally works,  until I close Chrome , and open it up later ,  when it pops up again.   Tried your troubleshooting tips,  have uninstalled and reinstalled twice.  Help.

There needs to be an update. Adblock is blocking chrome from loading webpages. The temporary solution I've found is to turn it off and back on, which needs to be repeated if you close out of chrome.

The fix posted here worked to fix "waiting for extension" problems on my computer. The fix is a reply posted here by "A Google User" Nov 5, 2018 that suggests resetting chrome using these steps: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3296214?hl=en 

Take the time to make some notes before you reset: any pinned tabs (you'll have to re-pin them), extensions you have on/off (you'll have to turn them back on), the order of your extension icons to the right of your address bar (turning off all extensions will make it forget what order you had them in). It will also clean your cookies, which will log you out of all web sites. You will have to sign back in again, enter 2-factor authentication codes, check "remember me" boxes, etc. This will be more disruptive to some people. But it fixed the "waiting" issue and so it is worth the small hassle for me.

It crashes lot of times.It is very annoying that I have to reload every time.
I'm using windows 10 newest build all the time.Same with Chrome.
Also using too much memory when your PC is on few days.Its start from 100 mb and the 2nd day 1.5 GB. I have to again reload manually from the Chrome extension menu.It will be great if it can reload by itself.

Yeah its broke again on and off getting a black dam screen now sorry for doubting you guys

It worked like a charm for so long time, but now websites are getting broken by Adblock. I guess it's the webdevelopers who found a way around this block - I tried with three different adblocker (Adblock, AdblockPlus and the Banner Blocker built in Kaspersky Anti Virus) - they all display the same page like it's scrolled all UP (20 centimeters UP ABOVE the screen, so you can't see the top of the content)
Check www.ekstrabladet.dk and see for yourself. Turn Adblock off and see the difference (with ads, sigh)

Else I've been very satisfied with this product, and won't hesistate the slightest to recommend it to others!

As of 9/12/2018 this doesnt work anymore. For a long time it's done what it needs to, but since the last couple of updates, it's broken. It kept shutting off for a while now, but now it crashes so frequently like it can only block a couple hundred adds before it just goes kaput. I used to never have issues but with in the last couple of months it seems like a every few days it crashes and I have to reset my browser, closing all my windows I had opened (which arent alot in comparison) Now it's crashing a couple of times in just ONE day.

Fix it, or I'm going to have to use something else.

Now turned it off. No longer works properly, half my web pages load wrong plus lost images on Facebook.

Good but eats RAM until it causes running problems for chrome, have to manually reset it to clear it out.

This used to be great but the latest update broke it. I can't actually select any options in settings anymore. Additionally, a website that I visit constantly somehow has figured out how to get Adblock to ignore its ads. I had manually blocked them, but now all those settings are gone and I can't block them again. I'm about to look for an alternative.

I really like it but recently it's been turning it self off for no reason
-------------------------

i like the wording of this rating, "liked it", i did like it, emphasis on past tense, it was a simple add on that blocked most ads automatically and let me manually block anything that made it through, unfortunately even with acceptable ads disabled it has started ignoring previously blocked ads and further, i've noticed the ability to block ads manually has become hidden and more complicated
-------------------------
off
I really wanted to give a 5 star to this bad boy. But unfortunately, despite its awesomeness and powerful software to block annoying adds, Adblock Plus forgot an essential feature in their software, the ability to turn off the extension from the extension's icon, which other ad blockers provide. Having so many extensions in the chrome bar, creates the need of easy access to essential features like this. I am disappointed such a powerful software forgot an essential common-sense feature like this.
-------------------------
off
I still have this installed... for now. I always considered this a great extension, then got a bit less thrilled with it when they started whitelisting advertisers that pay them. And of course, the checkbox that enables these ads always seems to turn on by itself, even after I turn it off.

Now whenever I open my browser I get a new tab from Adblock advertising their product.

I understand they need to make money, but this is getting a bit obnoxious.

Worked for years, then in Apr2018, it co-incided with  a disablement of the Google Drive PDF previewer.

Google Drive PDF previewer worked when Adblock Plus was switched off in Chrome (on Win10x64).

Have had to disable Adblock Plus so as to use the previewer.

it was really good no ads then today all the ads are back non intrusive ads are off and yet ads everywere

Threw me off for a minute, but I guess they changed the way to block specific pop ups.
-------------------------

I hate to say it but more and more websites are starting to find a way to get around Adblock Plus. Youtube is the first one I noticed where the video just blanks out until I turn off Adblock Plus. It'll play but I get nothing visual. If I turn ABP off and refresh, I get the video BUT with the annoying ads now. Sigh. 

The app still cleans up websites but occasionally I get websites that know I'm using it and won't show me content until I turn it off so I had to lower my rating for ABP.
-------------------------
manual
It did not remove all ads even the ones I manually blocked
-------------------------
off
This worked great but as the months rolled by more and more ads keep't popping up.
So I did some digging and Adblock Plus is selling out and taking money for not blocking ads.
So I have since switched to "AdBlocker Ultimate" and now everything is blocked again.
At this point with it selling out it's hard to tell whether or not it's working anymore as turning it off and on I still got the same amount of adds on specific websites despite it claiming it blocked 9 ads.
This developer has now been compromised.

It needs an update.  On Chrome after you watch any video on YouTube the audio begins to go off sync.

works great but there needs to be an easier and faster way to turn it completely on or off. had to delete for that reason :(

It clearly wipes out all of the advertisements, sometimes I have to turn it off to read some web pages :))

WOW! That's what a tool is. I am so happy to have this extension. Specially just blocking obtrusive advertising is what I wanted!

You can support the website makers who put good advertising methods in use WOW!

P.S.: I love adverts and sometimes I find new stuff while I'm browsing. But some are straight off irritating. I have this app then problem is solved!

Updated review:
It has become far too bloated or ???  Pages take forever to load, the Chrome status bar very frequently shows "Waiting for extension AdBlock Plus"

It's slowed my browser so much I've had to disable it.  I now see more ads, but at least the pages load more quickly.  The goal of blocking ads was to speed the loading of pages and other benefits, but it's going the other way now.  Ghostery takes care of some of it, but think I'm off to find a new ad-blocker to replace ABP.

==========
Previous review:
5*
Just excellent!  I've been using it for quite a while and it works so well.  The only problem I seem to have is sometimes Chrome says it's waiting on the ABP extension in the status bar.  I'm not sure if something else is causing that or if it's the extension itself.

I'm even nice to the sites and allow the non-intrusive ads but will block the ones that detect ad-blockers.  Here's the deal - play nice or I don't play at all.  (OK, so some eventually get blocked by Ghostery anyway... continue reading.)

This extension in combination with Ghostery takes care of just about everything I need.  Sometimes I've found I have to whitelist sites in ABP to get them to work.  I use Ghostery to block the rest, along with trackers, but it usually needs some tweaking to allow some sites/features to work correctly.

This is pretty good and blocks all ads for the most part, however it's far from perfect. I'm not sure if these are things the the developers can fix, but they are minuses against this extension. On certain websites, I find that when Ad Block Plus is on the website won't function properly. For example, On YouTube, if the ad happens to be a YouTube survey, then the video just won't load until Ad Block Plus is off. Another example: DeviantArt. In Notifications and Notes, the links to open the comment chain or note will not work at all until 
Ad Block Plus is off. Those are the only two that I'm aware of, though I'm sure they aren't alone. Another thing, some websites have literally made me redirect to a page telling me to turn Ad Block Plus off until I do so. So Ad Block Plus is 100% useless on those sites. Overall I like it and would recommend it, however these problems can be quite annoying and defeat the purpose to the extension in the first place.
-------------------------

i think its a contradiction because you run adblocker because you do not want adds , yet adblocker spams you with notifications that are totally irrelevant, Unwanted!!!! and just plain annoying and as far as i am aware you cant disable them or turn it off ... so be ware that you will be spammed by totally uncalled for popups and notifications

It's a charm. But people sometimes pay several hundred dollars for ads, and this extension makes all the money spent simply turn into a joke. Don't recommend it to you unless you see the same ad over and over again. It is very good, but ruins buissness's budgets. I'd give it 4 stars (-1 because of some options not working) but I'm knocking off 1 of the stars for ruining money businesses worked hard to gain and simply turning it into a joke. Also, a pretty high amount of CPU/RAM usage is added with this extension, making me knock off another star, total of 2/5 stars. In other words, this ad gets a 40 out of 100,or pretty much an F, even though i would consider it as a D or maybe even a C.
-------------------------

In all honesty, I wanted ALL ads off of my laptop.  I downloaded this, and all ads were gone. Youtube ads don't pop up before videos, my tumblr feed is clean, my SumoPaint is full screen now, and my sister's webkinz page is now no longer cluttered with ads. I'm in love with this extension, and I don't plan to uninstall it any time soon.

This extension is completely useless on Chrome as even with the non intrusive ads turned off you will still get ad's on sites and even floating banner ad's. Going to give Ad Block a try instead this Ad Block Plus.

Hey there Trelenarto! It may be that the ads you're seeing are part of our acceptable ads program. If you'd like to turn this off, you can go into options and un-check the 'Allow some non-intrusive advertising'!

I have no idea why other people sometimes complain about ABP, except for the CPU usage. But even the Adgaurd extension and uBlock let me down. Someone above said they switched to uBlock Origin and tested it on wowhead.com... well both adguard and ublock failed to block ads on the site, actually when I turned them off the ads were gone. I use adblock plus only know. Little affect on the CPU is a small price to pay for a good adblock, although my AV also blocks some ads & trackers and I have Ghostery which helps too, so it ublock and adguard may have just been incompatible with those add-ons.
-------------------------
off
Switched over to uBlock Origin as wowhead.com (awful site and the reason I first installed ABP years ago) fed me ad after ad that I could not block even after selecting the elements. These were consuming enough bandwidth to keep the page constantly reloading and force the stream I was watching to buffer.

I stuck with ABP and recommended it to friends even when they allowed non-intrusive ads, but it seems they are allowing pretty much everything through now from videos to ads that try to serve you (and would have been successful without my AV) malware.  On multiple PCs I have Acceptable Ads turned off and am still shown acceptable and unacceptable ads. 

I'll gladly return to this company and product if they can return to their former main goal of blocking ads.  Really disappointing.

Really good at blocking most ads but it is necessary to use the element blocker and do it manually instead sometimes. Needs to have developers constantly coming up with new ways to combat ads like PHP/javascripts ones, great work overall though can't complain for sure.
-------------------------
manual
Blocks ads like it's supposed to. And if it doesn't block an ad for some reason, it has a "Block Element" tool that you can use to block that ad manually, as well as an "Add your own filters" tab in the options menu that makes it possible (with a little bit of html/css knowledge) to silence an irritating page-element for good.

You can even whitelist sites (By clicking the icon and then clicking "enabled on this site" to change to disabled) that you want to support, or sites that usually avoid intrusive advertising, to help them make some profit without degrading your sanity.

Only downside is that its reviews page is full of hate from people who are (probably) paid by advertisers to discredit its wondrous power.

...That, and people who just don't know how to use it.

I have used AdBlocker for years, it was one of the first things I installed on peoples computers along with Chrome after having to reinstall windows cause of peoples poor internet habits. I am now seeing a bunch of ads, I have turned off the non-intrusive ads but still seeing ads on sites. It is a shame cause it used to be the thing I recommended to everyone and told them how to whitelist sites they wanted to give ad revenue to and how to block things that ADP might have missed. Now I have to go look for a better option cause I am not going to allow ADP to make money off advertisers for ads they are supposed to be blocking. Normally I do not rate things or review them, but this reversal of what your company stands for is ludicrous.

This would be like buying a water filter to clean up your water and then the water filter company decided to allow certain chemicals through the filter cause they feel they are safe and are also being paid by the chemical companies to allow the chemicals through their filter. Stupid move ADP.

Ad revenue helps some sites (and plugin developers) survive.  I find Adblock Plus' "non-intrusive advertising" to be more than tolerable.  If you are really so self-absorbed that you assume all ads only exist to piss you off, you can always disallow the non-intrusive advertising in the settings and return it to a full blocker.  I'm sure the dev wouldn't mind if you threw him a couple bucks for making this plugin and offering it for free, should you choose to disable the non-intrusive ads.

Does not block a lot of ads and now has started to REPLACE ads with their own so they can gain revenue off of content not made by them.

I used it for years and it was fine, but their selling of ad-space has pushed me to alternatives.

Adblock Plus does not block all ads, but replaces many with what they deem "safe" ads. While it would be fine if they were going to the site owner, ADBLOCK PLUS PROFITS OFF OF THE ADS THAT THEY USE TO REPLACE ADS ON OTHER SITES, WHICH IS HARMFUL TO BOTH THE CONSUMER AND SITE OWNER.
-------------------------

Installed this extension because I wanted to block ads.  I figured an extension called AD BLOCK would block ads. 

However, it turns out this extension does not block ads; it actually displays ads.  They are paid by advertisers to show you certain ads which is a HUGE conflict of interest and completely and utterly ruins any trust in the company.

You can opt out of the paid ads, but if the company REALLY cared about their users, they would turn this off by default and let you opt in to it.  Instead, their plan is to take advantage of people unaware of the opt out.   Unethical business practice that is only allowed because they met the minimum legal requirements by hiding an opt out button in the settings.  

Ads and ad servers can be compromised and even if a website is trustworthy, ads on their page are out of their control and can compromise your computer security, give you viruses, steal your passwords, etc.  This extension used to be a strong line of computer security because it helped prevent this.  Now they give you adds and no matter how sure they are that the ads are safe, there is always the possibility that they will be hacked and start sending you viruses.  This new change will 100% negatively impact your computer security.

As far as the world gets more acquainted with ABP, the auto-block goes to space ): 
Lately I have been experiencing a lot of navigation with ads all over the place (even unchecking the "allow non-invasive ads" box) 
So, I end up mainly using the extension interface to block the ads manually rather than navigating without having this trouble. 

So, from having a great experience with adblock plus to what I am experiencing now, I'm leaving you 3 stars, despite I'd see as more fit if I could give only 2,5 stars.

Advertising is HUGE money. Adblocker (ABP) was the 1st, and is the biggest ad blocker.
It is true that they have started allowing some static ads (but you can change your settings so it blocks ALL ads).
However, please consider 2 things:
1. Some really good free sites rely on ads to survive. If all ads were blocked on all sites then we would lose loads of great sites on the internet, because they can't cover their costs.

2. It may be smart of ABP to 'work with' websites, and allow them a few small static adverts  (that are non-intrusive). If they always block everything, then sites will just continue to hire programmers/ hackers to block anyone from viewing their content if they use adblockers. E.G. Many sites have already started fighting back against ABP by developing software that DETECTS if you are using ABP, and won't let you view content unless you disable it.
THEN...
There are 2 solutions:

1. Add Anti Adblocker Killer to ABP filter.
OR.
2. You can pause it briefly on that page, then click on what you want to view, then turn ABP back on. You can then view the content after the 1st ad pops up, but there won't be any more ads again. 
(E.G. Some Movie sites that bombard you with hundreds of ads, now say 'disable Adblocker to continue' - So, just pause ABP, click on film, then un-pause ABP. - You will see the 1st advert, but ABP will stop all the other ads once un-paused, and the site thinks it's turned off permanently. (SO NO NEED TO ADD ANTI AB KILLER if you are having trouble doing so. 
N>B:
-Solution 1. is best.
-Solution 2. is for people with basic IT skills, that don't like adjusting the extension's subscription filters.

Personally, I can live with 1, maybe 2 small ads on a free site if it let's the website survive.
Also, I rather ABP 'WORKED WITH" sites to limit ads so that it's reasonable; Otherwise there will be a constant war between the sites /programmers to stop AdBlockers - and we will constantly have to update. 
-------------------------
manual
I have switched to Adguard Adblocker and Ublock Origin.
After weeks of frustrating and manually blocking ads I did some research on ABP. Looks like they sold and are allowing advertisers to buy them  off and white list ads. We have no control of it. I will not be using them again.

I greatly miss the old-style block elements manually option. The new one makes it very difficult to tweak settings.

Really classy of you guys to file a ridiculous claim on the word "AdBlock" for Adblock Ultimate extension which sports a much more clean interface without the "Acceptable Ads" nonsense that all of you seem to be going to nowadays. If I get an Ad Blocker, I want it to block ads. Not show me ones that somebody paid to have sponsored. Your extension is worthless. I know I can shut it off, but why shouldn't that be off by default?

We "really" are going to get confused when we are searching for an AD blocker that meets our needs more than AdBlock Plus. I downloaded your terrible extension just long enough to voice my opinion on the matter. Your company is a real work of art. I just wanted to let you all know.

Good riddance. Claiming rights on a name that has become synonymous with ad blocking extensions. Really trying to protect your "Acceptable Ad" revenue, huh?

I think its great to be able to block annoying ads, but there are websites I wish to support by allowing their ads to show. I cannot add them to the whitelist with this program. I copy/paste the domain into the whitelist tab, click add, and nothing happens. I am removing this, trying another, and will check back here "some time" and see if you guys have fixed this problem.

I can understand why this has 5 stars in some reviews, because it's very good at blocking ads, but remember the ads make websites FREE, and you're cutting off their ability to stay in business. Why dont you just quit going to their website, because soon they won't exist anyway!

i like how theyre saying theyre making the internet a better place when the internet relys on ads 

basically cuting off food to the people who add to the internet and make it still free with no fees yet... 

and here are some ad block programs putting their own ads over the existing ads 

how ironic 

a leech is what you guys are to the internet .

Works perfectly.
The best feature, honestly, is the option to turn it off for certain sites. Some sites will just plague you with ads, but others are legitimate sites trying to just make a small bit of money from ads. As long as the ads are unintrusive, I will turn it off for a site.
-------------------------

Ambiguous and Unintuitive! The interface displays only "enabled" or "disabled" for the site you're on. But it is unclear whether this is referring to the plug-in or to Ads. The only indication that it is referring to the plug-in is that the icon turns grey. But that also means that the functionality is not intuitive because from the user's point of view they are turning Ads on and off, not the plug-in. So these are very poor UI decisions and need to change before I can go higher than 3 stars. Otherwise the plug-in is functional and seems to do the job.

It blocks every ad: I don't know what garbage people are writing of how it doesn't work; that is, unless you use the two of the Windows series which ABP doesn't work on.

The application gives off viruses which are PUP Optional registry keys. While these viruses are not a big deal and can also be in Microsoft products they can track you and there's no knowing if they can access personal information like bank accounts. Malwarebytes are a good product to remove these. The virus flow will stop if you remove ABP; that's your choice. I don't care if you say I'm straight up wrong; Malwarebytes picked up these viruses and my other downloads are from known publishers (known to Microsoft).

Works great, I get on other peoples browsers and keep wondering why there is so much junk on their webpages, then I realize it's because all of those ads are blocked on my browser.

It works marvelously, blocking all of the ads on any website.

SPAM do not download! I didn't use Adblock Plus and I got a notification every time I started Chrome that there was a new version of Adblock Plus and that I needed to upgrade.

This extension uses more resources than regular Adblock despite having fewer features. The fact that they're paid off to let ads through by default is just icing on the cake. You'll say "you can turn that feature off" but the fact that the feature exists to begin with is a shame, not to mention a lot of people have claimed it turns itself back on arbitrarily.

Barely blocks any ads, and when you block them manually it doesn't remember after you close down the browser. Would not recommend.

A must have for any internet users. I recommend it for older internet users as a way to reduce the number of ways they can get a virus, see scams, etc. For me, it has saved me many hours on Youtube, as I already see enough unskippable ads on TV. 

Sometimes I see a few Facebook ads that are partially blocked. You may have to update the subscription lists manually sometimes. (A quick way to get to that is to right click on the stop sign icon and click Options.) That's really the only negative thing I can say about it, and it's a minor one at that.

EDIT: A recent update added a way to block social sharing buttons, which streamlines loading even more for users with a slow connection, and cleans up a little more unnecessary clutter.

Faster internet connection as several people said. Blocks off most advertisement as promised. BUT, in some websites, although ads were blocked, some managed to slip in form of pop up. Even though I'm using the infamous Popper Blocker.

Before ABP, I was using AdBlock, no problem at all, no pop up as well. This "Plus" would only mean, "plus more problem to handle".

It's a good extension, but I had enough of random/ unpredictable pop ups, I'm going back to AdBlock.

Doesn't seem to block much in Chrome at all - I had to manually select elements to block on each page, and it doesn't cover YouTube in-video ads or the like either, which makes the whole exercise a bit pointless. AdBlock (totally different extension) works much better.

It worked fine until a recent update. Now it barely blocks anything. Youtube ads are back in full force, and I can only ever block one ad element on a site manually before ABP glitches up and refuses to block any more, unless I refresh the page I'm on.

It will not update anymore, and I have tried clearing my cache as well as uninstalling and reinstalling.

Something about the latest updates just refuses to work with ads anymore.

I've been using Adblock Plus for the past few years, but recently, I'd say within the past month, it's just kinda crapped out. It no longer disables/removes ads.

I found the resolution to the problem. You need to install the list manually Via right click of the adblock icon > Options, then install EasyList Via the "Add filter subscription" button.

Adblock Plus is NOT good. For all of you wanting to know why Adblock Plus is "not working": companies pay Adblock Plus to be whitelisted so they can display ads. Get Adblock. It is run entirely off donations, blocks Youtube ads, and doesn't take payments from companies to whitelist their websites.

Hands down one of the best extensions available. Blocks YouTube ads, search ads, dashboard ads, Pandora ads (on and off), ads of literally every single type. The one improvement that could be made is some way to show if a full-page ad has been blocked; it is sometimes unclear whether a large ad is blocked or the page simply fails to load.
-------------------------
manual
While this works well enough much of the time, it has a tendency to forget what filters you've added manually - meaning that, in cases where it doesn't block something that gets around its normal blocking behavior, it is utterly powerless.

An official port of Element Hiding Helper would be extremely useful, but there isn't one, and the one already listed in the store isn't official and may be a trick of some sort.

There are actually certain reasons/times that this should not be used. Those free applications, file-hosting websites, and other things that some of you love to use are often heavily ad-supported. There are very legitimate uses of this app, I don't deny that. Just remember not to rob honest content providers who need that revenue to either support a family, or more commonly, those that only use the ad money as a way to cover all the expenses of keeping their project afloat. If you happen to remember, just turn it off when using content that you value and frequently use. 
Please, I just ask that people consider what I'm saying. I'm really not trying to preach.

I (Chrome 16.0.912.77 m; Win 7) have been using this now for a very long time. Until recently it seemed a perfect ad-blocker (=5 stars rating).

When I manually update the filters, everything is ad free again. However, I do not want do that over and over again. What is wrong? Is that a known bug? Am I doing something wrong?

I have been using ABP for  several months and i used to be satisfied with it, because it is much lighter and much faster than the ordinary AdBlock. However, lately, let's say the last few weeks, i have noticed that the block - lists have started to become outdated every single day, but ABP doesn't update them so often and it looks as if it didn't find them outdated. As soon as i update them manually every ad disappears till the next day when the same ads appear again and i have to make another manual update. This is rather annoying and i am really disappointed. Everything would be fine if there were a single option for the user to choose how often to make these updates automatically or at least to check for updates. I would be grateful to the developer if he puts this option in the final release. If there is such an option but i have not noticed it i apologize

I've been using this free service for years and have become spoiled by it's wonderful seamless effectiveness!! So much so that it's  intolerable using websites like YouTube on my phone due to the barrage of garbage you're hit with constantly. Other websites have Google ads and others that take up  so much of the screen the content is no longer visible for over 3 flicks of the finger to scroll. Ridiculous!! Don't these people know that makes their websites look cheap and shabby? I know this is likely a normal experience to most but being protected by ABP  on my laptop where I spend most of my time has reduced my tolerance to zilch. I'm not sure why I haven't installed it on this cell I got last May, other than the fact that I already have no internal storage left due to the auto-loaded garbage that cells come with today-and I only have FB (not messenger) installed out of the big 4 media sites. [Thanks, Amazon shopping app etc].  Again, ridiculous!
My only ABP complaint is one that I almost couldn't have made due to the Very recent discovery-then loss of the matter.  I'd just found that there was an option to zero in on certain areas where ads are generated and pop up regularly, which would allow you to select then block just that offense. Alas,  after doing a reset on my poorly advised Acer Chromebook (pretty much a glorified cell phone in itself), this feature is no longer listed in the options anywhere.  I'm not talking about the "Block pop-up ads" check box, but the one that prompted selecting a certain area, which would then become highlighted within a box and featured in confirming whether that is what you wanted blocked. 
Ah, well. Easy come, easy go. It's in no way a deal breaker.  ABP's service was already making my web browsing experience 100% better as it was,  so no real complaints here from me. Thank You!!

i rlly liked this ad-blocker 
my only suggestion would be to add a blacklist feature where blacklisted websites would have all ads disabled but acceptable ads are allowed on every other website 
i have been suffering with some websites that have rlly awful ads but i want to support the other websites that i like, so it would be very appreciated if they had this feature

Always on YouTube.com  I had Adblocker Plus in place. Now I must refresh this page, every time I use it, even when I select another music video or movie feature.  I checked my Whitelist and Youtube was no on it. So I don't understand what happened to Adblock Plus in my Chrome. All other setting are S.O.P. and nothing should be different.

I love it, but I hate it too!  I have to reset my PC very often.  I'm tired of having to re-approve my settings all of the time!

I've been using AdBlock Plus for the past 4 years and have nothing but good things to say about my experience with it...but a recent update somewhere, has made it impossible to go to any websites with this extension installed. I'm having to use AdGuard for now, until this gets fixed.
UPDATE: I found out disabling the new EasyPrivacy Filter fixes it. Disable that if you're having issues!

Great most of the time. Blocks annoying ads on most websites, including video ads on YouTube. Unfortunately, some websites have filters that notice when you are using an ad blocker, and so you have to turn it off to load the site. I'm not sure if there are other ad blockers that can sneak past the filters, so this may or may not be ABP's fault.
-------------------------

Fantastic!  However some websites block me unless I turn-off AdBlocker (white list: eg.Weather.com). I wish there was a similar product for my Fire 10 Tablet.  Currently it runs "Silk" as its browser.  Any ideas from the Gallery..

I can't recommend this enough. It's the first thing I install on every fresh install I do, and the first thing I install in anyone else's computer (with their permission, of course haha). USE ADBLOCK PLUS. I've been using it for years. Recently, more and more web pages started to show a sign that pretty much says "Whitelist us or subscribe to our annoying newsletter. Do that or we won't let you read the article/post". Well, guess what... You can make those stupid things disappear just by using the built-in option that lets you select a new element to block. And straight from the UI, so you have zero need to read any code. USE ADBLOCK PLUS.

Let's be real here. IF I wanted to see ads, I wouldn't even use this plugin. Yet y'all whitelisting sites and their ads here and there by calling them "non-intrusive/acceptable" ads just to get cash from the very sites that nobody wanted ads from. No. You guys have been the backstabber of your own plugin. If anything, by using this trash I've been seeing more ads and "aRE YOU USING ADBLOCK?" popups. What's even the point of this?

Here is the skinny, I have used this app literally, for years and years now. It has been, by far, hands down the best app I have ever used!  After reading through many of the reviews I totally agree with those who say that people who experience issues with this app are also infected with some type of virus or malware. Now is when I must apologize for the star ratting I have posted because truly LOVE this app! All that said and to fault no other than myself I have just spent the last 15 hours repairing my laptop do to some very evil viruses, to winch I can only pray I have conquered...unfortunately I am now feeling less confident about that because I can not seem to get ABP to block all ads on YouTube, witch is the biggest reason I tout on about you to everyone when ever I am forced to endure a video that someone claims I just have to see!  This is usually someone with a mobile phone who has no clue that you even exist. All of this has brought me to whee I am now. Tired and bury eyed I am hoping that my review will catch the attention of someone who can help me get your app up and running like it used to be. This app is invaluable to me. No Exaggeration. I am hoping that it is something very simple I have failed to see/do because I am so exhausted. Like a setting that was changed or needing to reinstall or a updated I missed? IDK where to begin? I have had many issues with viruses and the like over the many years since I first installed ABP and I have never had an issue with this app being effected like this. Although having it turned off has been a sign that I had problems with something nefarious invading my system but for the most part has been very resistant to being compromised and quickly resolved as soon as the problem had been removed. I sur hope someone who knows the best way to resolve my issue here is able and willing to contact me soon? I am not one to wright reviews, I either uninstall an app if I can't get it to work like I want or I put up with it cause it does what I want good enough but never comment either way, Never do I proceed to writing a short novel as I've done here today. This is outta pure desperation as I did leave a message on your site yesterday as soon as the movie length commercials begain appearing on YouTube videos I was trying to view. Exaggerating a bit I hope you don't mind but it's how I feel. Your icon was and is on in my browser and when it originally happened the " allow acceptable add's box " was checked but correcting that didn't help. Also YouTube was listed under sites that I wanted adds allowed on. I'm a no adds person no exceptions unless the site won't let me proceed unless I allow it and only then will I temporally agree to the minimum and only to access the content I am seeking.
-------------------------

It works well, and I especially love the "block element" feature, which allows you to manually block images (and other elements, like iframes) on any page.  I do have a couple complaints about this feature, however...

1. It would be nice if your personal filters (i.e. the images, etc. you have blocked manually) were synced to your Chrome account.  They are not.  The same items need to be blocked all over again on any new device, despite using the same Chrome account.

2. If personal filters can't be synced, at least make it easier/more automated to save an upload a personal filter list.

3. If you block the wrong element accidentally, it would be nice if it were quick and easy to undo the mistake, without having to go into settings.  For example: an option to see all blocked elements, but have them marked, and be able to click "unblock" on an individual one.

4. It seems this feature is not available at all on the mobile device version of AdBlock.  Would be nice to see that corrected.

Have had this app about 3 days. So far I like it. I don't mind the acceptable ads that they let through on the side of the screen.I hated the ads that were in the middle of the content that I was trying to view. Used my first whitelist today for free coloring page for Poppy (VET) craft pictures. Took a little bit to figure it out, first time user.

It used to be amazing, but over a month ago, on Chrome/Mac it simply stopped blocking the in-feed Facebook ads, which was one of the main reasons I got the externsion to begin with.  Before, when this happened, it would take just a few days for the various lists and all to catch up with whatever changes that Facebook had done to get around the filters, but this time, no such luck, even after weeks and weeks.  Other sites are fine, and even the sidebar ads on Facebook are properly filtered out.  I was hoping today's update would have fixed that, but alas, not.  Until then, I'm looking around for something that will.

Just use uBlock Origin. Its faster, isn't as resource hungry, and doesnt accept money from companies to whitelist their ads. Not sure why anybody uses ABP anymore

It works, with the exception of sites that are using an 'adblocker wall' which force you to either whitelist or subscribe.  An increasing number of sites are doing this defeating the whole purpose of having an adblocker in the first place.  Developers have stated that it's possible to block these popups very easily, yet they don't, saying that they have chosen some kind of moral high ground (when it is more likely that they have been bribed by publishers to disable the adblock on certain sites.)  Go with one of the other adblock extensions like uBlock that actually work!
-------------------------
whitelist
I've been using Adblock for about 10 years, but lately most of the websites I regularly visit detect Adblock and are forcing you to whitelist or disable Adblock to access their site.  It doesn't even matter if you allow unobtrusive ads.  My use for blocking ads is for security reasons, ads are given to you through 3rd party sites embedded in a page.  I used to give Adblock a solid 5 star rating but they have lost my support because they cannot stop a site from forcing all ads upon you!

Time to say Goodbye!  Had it for years, not good any more.  Since that "redesign" for FF Quantum, not user friendly interface, NO MORE AUTO BACKUP.  Had a problem with another extension from the Store (Reader View) which messed up terribly.  Finally able to dump that (couldn't for a long time, many problems).  Then ABP was messed up.  Clicking Options gets FILE NOT FOUND!  But it IS there, I checked.  NO BACKUP for my long personal block list.  Cannot get to it now via Options.  It MUST be saved somewhere in all the various files scattered everywhere on the HD.  Tried Forum.  Took an hour to write DETAILS of what happened.  "Saved" in forum, which DELETED THE ENTIRE!  "Sorry, we don't like spam here."  WHAT?  There were no links, no emojis, nothing but text.  Wrote to email support which gave me nonsense answers and NO HELP.  Could not or WOULD not say how the personal list is SAVED on my computer.  Obviously it MUST be saved SOMEWHERE in SOME FILE!  A tech guy CANNOT TELL ME WHERE????  Have another blocker going now, PITA to have to train that one for the personal blocks, but will not trust APB again.

Isn't pop-up blocking pretty much a default (either as simply built-in, or as setting that may be on or off by default) in pretty much any decent browser (including some fringe browsers, desktop or mobile and even most text browsers - I'm betting at least ELinks probably has even option for this - Links, Links 2, eww (actually not text-only, it's a browser for eMacs, which can be ran in terminal as well as GUI window), w3m (which also has an eMacs front end that also shows images, even though w3m is basically a text browser - but it has ability to show images with colored block characters, if enabled. How many pixels one character is in width and height can be set, because using one character per pixel would easily fill the whole terminal even with small image - so far I prefer w3m in eMacs, although apparently eww is written in pure eLisp and is thus native eMacs application; people need to understand that comparing eMacs with other "editors" and "IDE's" is that it may be the main use of eMacs, but it's really an all-capable OS within an OS), they all probably have pop-up blocking either by default or as an option.

I'm pretty certain Chrome and Chromium has had this for a long time, has it not? I'm not checking right now, but I'm surprised if not. If it had not though, I'm sure the most common ad-block lists already block ad popups anyway, thus leaving only actual purposeful pop-up's (which seem to have been disappeared, as people can do this more user-friendly way by showing so-called "in-page pop-up's", like maybe login window, and because this way the browser doesn't block they log-in window from opening :D ).

Is there something I'm misunderstanding with what you mean by "pop-up blocker"?

Just wanted to confirm that Adblock Plus is absolutely getting paid by big companies to let their ads through. After installing a better adblocker the Dove ad (the tab was still loaded) disappeared immediately, as did the various other ads I've seen around (all by large companies). I would be VERY interested in knowing the exact figure the developer is being paid because I would like to know if it's even possible for something like an indie brand to pay to let their ads through. I don't think that should be allowed at all but if the price tag is something an indie brand couldn't afford then that makes it even worse. I would whitelist some smaller sites in order to support content creators and it's mostly indie brands being advertised on those sites which also supported them and I didn't mind that since their ads generally weren't annoying, flashing, loud, etc. However, I did not support big brands (and they didn't need the advertising anyway) and so if the developer's price tag was high then no indie brands would be advertised at all, just the big companies that, again, don't even need the advertising that badly.

The developer has SOLD OUT but I would be very interested in knowing how much it cost for them to let ads through.
-------------------------

I still have this installed... for now. I always considered this a great extension, then got a bit less thrilled with it when they started whitelisting advertisers that pay them. And of course, the checkbox that enables these ads always seems to turn on by itself, even after I turn it off.

Now whenever I open my browser I get a new tab from Adblock advertising their product.

I understand they need to make money, but this is getting a bit obnoxious.

Updated review:
It has become far too bloated or ???  Pages take forever to load, the Chrome status bar very frequently shows "Waiting for extension AdBlock Plus"

It's slowed my browser so much I've had to disable it.  I now see more ads, but at least the pages load more quickly.  The goal of blocking ads was to speed the loading of pages and other benefits, but it's going the other way now.  Ghostery takes care of some of it, but think I'm off to find a new ad-blocker to replace ABP.

==========
Previous review:
5*
Just excellent!  I've been using it for quite a while and it works so well.  The only problem I seem to have is sometimes Chrome says it's waiting on the ABP extension in the status bar.  I'm not sure if something else is causing that or if it's the extension itself.

I'm even nice to the sites and allow the non-intrusive ads but will block the ones that detect ad-blockers.  Here's the deal - play nice or I don't play at all.  (OK, so some eventually get blocked by Ghostery anyway... continue reading.)

This extension in combination with Ghostery takes care of just about everything I need.  Sometimes I've found I have to whitelist sites in ABP to get them to work.  I use Ghostery to block the rest, along with trackers, but it usually needs some tweaking to allow some sites/features to work correctly.
-------------------------

Adblocker Plus was once a wonderful extension known by many. That reputation, from years ago, is why ABP still has good ratings today. Unfortunately, ABP is no longer useful or reputable; they sold out. 

Ad companies now pay ABP to be allowed to bypass this extension. Therefor, you still see ads- ABP just becomes their distributor. On top of this, many sites now have anti-adblocker scripts that cause more disruption to your web browsing than the ads do. Better adblockers can get around this script; ABP will not.

Adblocker Plus is no longer reliable or trustworthy. Try uBlock Origin, or something else instead. To bypass the anti-adblocker scripts and forced whitelisting, you may want to add an additional extension, like uBlock Protection Extension. (I haven't tested uBlock a lot yet, but it has a great rep and seems good so far. It's working on some sites ABP failed miserably with)

The war on intrusive ads is ever-changing. What works today, may be outdated in two months. Adblocker Plus has been dead in the water for about a year now. Never trust them again.

ABP has really gone downhill. uBlock Origin is much more effective. 

Now that ABP accepts money from a couple large conglomerates (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Taboola) in exchange for being whitelisted, lots of ads just can't be blocked anymore. Just about ALL of the annoying video ads on youtube get through! Not to mention all the tracking happening through cookies, etc.

uBlock Origin is now a much better blocker, and uses significantly less system memory/resources as well.

Not true at all! Adblock plus is open source, which means that it PHYSICALLY CANNOT accept money for being whitelisted! Don't make unsupported claims!!

Blocks ads like it's supposed to. And if it doesn't block an ad for some reason, it has a "Block Element" tool that you can use to block that ad manually, as well as an "Add your own filters" tab in the options menu that makes it possible (with a little bit of html/css knowledge) to silence an irritating page-element for good.

You can even whitelist sites (By clicking the icon and then clicking "enabled on this site" to change to disabled) that you want to support, or sites that usually avoid intrusive advertising, to help them make some profit without degrading your sanity.

Only downside is that its reviews page is full of hate from people who are (probably) paid by advertisers to discredit its wondrous power.

...That, and people who just don't know how to use it.

been a longtime user of Adblock Plus and its Element Hiding Helper, but especially over the past couple of years it has become pretty useless.

the reason? site developers are more savvy and, whereas before if I chose an element in the HTML and blocked it, well now, developers run PHP/javascripts that rotate or substitute content within that <div> or element, so the AdBlock works only for the moment you are on that page. if you reload the page or come back to it, boom, a new ad is there and a new element has taken its place.

meaning that advertisers are more sophisticated than the Adblock developers. seems to me Adblock had a good thing but then just decided to let it ride without keeping up-to-date with what advertisers (many of them lowlife advertisers) would come up with to try to get around the block.

Adblock is now old news. i'm looking for something better, one that will not be outfoxed by PHP or javascripts that rotate ad content on every page load and which are impossible to isolate and block using Adblock's filters -- even ones that i custom-write.

Still getting a ton of pop-up windows, from a ton of scam companies, with a fresh install so no mal-ware, no viruses no nothing.

The ad removal is great, but the extension needs more filters - like those in the original Adblock. In terms of ad removal Adblock Plus does a better job compared to Adblock.

I have used AdBlocker for years, it was one of the first things I installed on peoples computers along with Chrome after having to reinstall windows cause of peoples poor internet habits. I am now seeing a bunch of ads, I have turned off the non-intrusive ads but still seeing ads on sites. It is a shame cause it used to be the thing I recommended to everyone and told them how to whitelist sites they wanted to give ad revenue to and how to block things that ADP might have missed. Now I have to go look for a better option cause I am not going to allow ADP to make money off advertisers for ads they are supposed to be blocking. Normally I do not rate things or review them, but this reversal of what your company stands for is ludicrous.

This would be like buying a water filter to clean up your water and then the water filter company decided to allow certain chemicals through the filter cause they feel they are safe and are also being paid by the chemical companies to allow the chemicals through their filter. Stupid move ADP.

I am seeing some one star reviews and I am not sure why people are having issues. I have been using this extension for years. You have to configure what blocking list you want to subscribe to, never see ads on the web and it always throws me off when I am on someone else's computer that doesn't have it.

Advertising is HUGE money. Adblocker (ABP) was the 1st, and is the biggest ad blocker.
It is true that they have started allowing some static ads (but you can change your settings so it blocks ALL ads).
However, please consider 2 things:
1. Some really good free sites rely on ads to survive. If all ads were blocked on all sites then we would lose loads of great sites on the internet, because they can't cover their costs.

2. It may be smart of ABP to 'work with' websites, and allow them a few small static adverts  (that are non-intrusive). If they always block everything, then sites will just continue to hire programmers/ hackers to block anyone from viewing their content if they use adblockers. E.G. Many sites have already started fighting back against ABP by developing software that DETECTS if you are using ABP, and won't let you view content unless you disable it.
THEN...
There are 2 solutions:

1. Add Anti Adblocker Killer to ABP filter.
OR.
2. You can pause it briefly on that page, then click on what you want to view, then turn ABP back on. You can then view the content after the 1st ad pops up, but there won't be any more ads again. 
(E.G. Some Movie sites that bombard you with hundreds of ads, now say 'disable Adblocker to continue' - So, just pause ABP, click on film, then un-pause ABP. - You will see the 1st advert, but ABP will stop all the other ads once un-paused, and the site thinks it's turned off permanently. (SO NO NEED TO ADD ANTI AB KILLER if you are having trouble doing so. 
N>B:
-Solution 1. is best.
-Solution 2. is for people with basic IT skills, that don't like adjusting the extension's subscription filters.

Personally, I can live with 1, maybe 2 small ads on a free site if it let's the website survive.
Also, I rather ABP 'WORKED WITH" sites to limit ads so that it's reasonable; Otherwise there will be a constant war between the sites /programmers to stop AdBlockers - and we will constantly have to update. 
-------------------------
list
I have switched to Adguard Adblocker and Ublock Origin.
After weeks of frustrating and manually blocking ads I did some research on ABP. Looks like they sold and are allowing advertisers to buy them  off and white list ads. We have no control of it. I will not be using them again.

True - some sites are catching up + detect adblocker, then won't let you view their site's content unless you disable Adblocker (ABP).

Generally good, but you used to be able to whitelist domains from the toolbar by clicking the adblock plus icon?

Lately it makes Chrome run some pages incredibly slowly.  Google sites like YouTube, Drive, and Gmail are almost unusable at times.  Most other sites are also slowed down but not nearly as bad.

I've tested and it's definitely Adblock Plus causing this.  Temporarily disabling it immediately makes sites load, scroll, and interact at normal speed again.  I only have the Easylist filter selected.

It wasn't like this until maybe a month ago.

I think its great to be able to block annoying ads, but there are websites I wish to support by allowing their ads to show. I cannot add them to the whitelist with this program. I copy/paste the domain into the whitelist tab, click add, and nothing happens. I am removing this, trying another, and will check back here "some time" and see if you guys have fixed this problem.

I can understand why this has 5 stars in some reviews, because it's very good at blocking ads, but remember the ads make websites FREE, and you're cutting off their ability to stay in business. Why dont you just quit going to their website, because soon they won't exist anyway!

Great! I would give it 5 stars, but recently I have been seeing banners on some sites that, even when I use the Block Element feature to block them (it allows you to force an ad or banner to be removed by adding it or it's location on the page specifically to the block list), they pop back up instantly. What is unusual is that when they pop back up (when I have not reloaded or refreshed the web page yet) they show up in a different location on the page (the top left area) until I refresh the page and then they are back to where they were originally and unchanged.

I have used this extension for years and have never had issues like this before. I think companies are finding some ways to prevent Adblock-type extensions from doing their job. I figure that this is something that Adblock Plus will fix or figure out how to get around. I hope so at least or I will have to switch to another extension

Spent some time doing basic research, found a rabbit hole. In short, ABP has sold out and now accepts money from companies to whitelist their ads, so it's effectively fighting itself and is not working towards the intended purpose of blocking ads in the first place.

Avoid, look for alternatives.

Adblock Plus no longer is blocking ads. I started seeing annoying things on the web. I unchecked "allow some non-intrusive ads", but still continue to see crap.

This plugin used to work correctly. Now, it doesn't even block ads half the times I use it. I have non-intrusive advertising disabled, so every ad should be blocked. Oh, and the block element feature barely works correctly, making that another useless feature. Contacted the developers, and they told me to restart chrome and make sure that all of the filters were enabled. That didn't help in fixing the plugin. This just shows how broken the plugin is, and how neglectant the support for it is. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

Adblock Plus is horrible. Not only does it serve to make bloggers lose revenue, it also makes bloggers want to charge for their content. After all, bloggers have to make money.

EVER HEARD ABOUT ABP'S CORRUPTION? Eyeo is in bed with big business. They're openly and shamelessly extorting money from large corporations like Google by forcing them to pay large amounts of money to whitelist their "safe" ads. Not as innocent as you thought, eh?

Eyeo claims that bloggers can get their ads unblocked for free, but I've applied with no response from Eyeo for over a year.

The only reason I use AdBlock is to test my anti AdBlock software on my blog!

I'm surprised Google didn't remove ABP from the store yet!

I have used ABP for a long, long time and I have installed it on MANY computers. It isn't horrible but, unfortunately, I think it has lost its way. It now literally sells the ability to bypass its filters to big-shot advertisers such as Google and Microsoft. In my opinion that is unethical, opt-out notwithstanding.

Adblockers should block ads. I put no conditions or exceptions on that statement because none are needed. All ads, all the time, no matter what -- that's what adblockers should do.

The adblocking community has moved on to different tools and continuing users of ABP should consider alternatives.

WARNING---The developer is paid by advertisers to allow “Acceptable Ads” through the filters.  They claim this is a noble act, intended to change online advertising for the better, while at the same time providing the funding necessary to keep Adblock Plus running.  Unfortunately this approach not worked in other industries where the regulators are funded by those they intend to regulate.  

Adblock Plus now provides these “good” ad companies with a database of more than 20 million daily users (a very conservative estimate) who prefer not to receive annoying ads all over their browsers.  This treasure chest of user data will be packaged and sold to the less honorable advertisers and help them create more subtle ad placements designed to blend with the content or even replace real content with “sponsored content”, which is a far worse outcome than a flashing banner ad. 

If the folks behind Adblock Plus needed additional funds, why didn't they just appeal to their users or try crowdfunding?  The variety of alternative funding systems available today should give an idealistic company plenty of options other than selling out.

I installed this extension due to the annoyance of all pop-up ads on the lower and right sides of my screen. It seemed to work well as far as that went, but for some reason I was unable to access Facebook AT ALL after 2 days of having it installed. I removed it and Facebook was accessible. 

Ads wouldn't be so bad if they weren't so obnoxious. When they interfere with my ability to see/read content on certain websites, they get annoying. If the sites that depend on ads to operate would make them less annoying, people wouldn't seek out extensions like ABP to filter them out.

Unfortunately, these extensions are garbage. They always seem to do more or less than advertised or desired.

A must have for any internet users. I recommend it for older internet users as a way to reduce the number of ways they can get a virus, see scams, etc. For me, it has saved me many hours on Youtube, as I already see enough unskippable ads on TV. 

Sometimes I see a few Facebook ads that are partially blocked. You may have to update the subscription lists manually sometimes. (A quick way to get to that is to right click on the stop sign icon and click Options.) That's really the only negative thing I can say about it, and it's a minor one at that.

EDIT: A recent update added a way to block social sharing buttons, which streamlines loading even more for users with a slow connection, and cleans up a little more unnecessary clutter.

Works wonders!  It blocks all of the annoying ads and discretely hides them away.  Webpages are presented as they should be sans the advertising.  It occurred to me how well this extension works when I used a friends' computer which was not running Adblock Plus.  I couldn't believe how many ads this extension blocks!  However, this extension is not perfect.  The only drawback I have found is that it will incorrectly block the basic functionality of certain websites.  This can be easily fixed by adding the site to your "Whitelist".  I gave it five stars because this is one of the essential extensions you should use! I have used this on Opera and Firefox as well.  Works just as well on any browser.

it says too many filters can crash your browser and i put on 3 total not additional and it deletes the filters every like few days and i have to put them back on...and not to mention when i have the filters on it's also inconsistent with the blocking and takes up lot of ram space

Used to be amazing for me, worked flawlessly in the background. In 6 months I had around 20,000 ads blocked or so without having to think about it. An easy 5-star rating, with thoughts of donating to support it (I rarely do that)

Recently, however, the extension seems to periodically 'forget' the  filter list I've selected (EasyList), which then lets all the ads back in - YouTube, Facebook, etc.  The developer reccommends a reinstall, but that hasn't fixed this problem. 

So it still works great when it runs properly, but having to redownload the filter lists twice a day really cuts into the convenience this extension provides. Docked it 2 stars for that.

This, at one time, was great. It really does block just about every ad- you dont even see the ones in between moves on words with friends. But. The but in this case is that Adblock Plus has a bug. There are numerous site where if you try to use your "back" button, you find that your history has been filled with one website- The only way to navigate back at this point is to retype your search/address, our open your full history. If you are lucky enough to figure it out early, pressing and holding the back button to open the short list EVERY time you navigate back will stop the repeated duplication, but thats a pain. This is rated at 2.5 stars. It does work great to block ads, but the cost is not worth the benefit. Find another on to use till this one gets fixed.

755,254 Ads blocked by this Noble Prize worthy piece of software. This lifesaver has saved my visual cortex from having to process a gazillion gigabytes of advertisements. I'm in the developers of this software debt. For the newbs, you have to select and download a filter list. I use Easy and Adblock custom. In addition if you view the "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" list, select, copy, and paste it in to "Add your own filters" Chrome will be hitting 88 mph and you'll be seeing some plutonium speeds!

"Plus" would suggest this is somewhat better than the original "AdBlock" but it is not.

In fact it is a lot worse. While the original AdBlock is developed by one person who relays entirely on donations and is not making any contracts or what so ever with add companies this here is developed by a company (Eyeo GmbH) which gets a ton of money from add companies and in return puts their adds on a whitelist. Still they are so bold to beg their users for donations (as if they wouldn't make enough money already). They also block news about their marketing scheme in various countries. So with Addblock Plus you just see what they want you to see (including some adds which could afford to pay).

So just use the AdBlock instead and don't support this rip-off.
-------------------------
filter
For all you saying it no longer works PLEASE READ: simply click on the 'Adblock Plus" icon, click 'options', click 'Add filter subscription', then add your region's 'EasyList'. Now all the annoying ads will be blocked again.
-------------------------
list
No longer blocks pop-up ads in some sites(including torrent sites). Uses 50+ MB of RAM. Can be replaced by Ghostery. Only offers support for Easy List. Whitelist only option: no blacklist! Too many concessions to vendors, using the "non-intrusive ads" excuse.
-------------------------

It would be a 5/5 until today when I saw every ad leaking through the filter. I updated lists and everything and still happens. Hope they fix it
-------------------------
filter
Adblock Plus is no longer effective.  Ads are getting through, and pop-ups are becoming a regular sight on my screen.  The filter lists seem to be ineffective all together.
-------------------------
list
Works well, but it seems slow and Chrome keeps hanging up on "Waiting for extension Adblock Plus."  Would also be nice to see a list of what ads were blocked instead of just a count.
-------------------------
filter
Guys i had the same problem. All you need to do is to edit your filter lists.  It got reset.
-------------------------
list
To all those complaining about it "not working" or "not allowing you to change what it disables", Adblock Plus operates using block lists, which (obviously) contain lists of sites to block content from, by customizing these lists you can change what it blocks. If it isn't working, then you probably aren't using a very good block list, try finding a different one. Just because ads aren't being blocked doesn't mean the extension is broken, it just means it's not been told to block these ads. I think regular ad block (not plus) ships with a better list by default, so you could try that as well.
-------------------------
list
In responce to 'dvwxxx.', here is my own review.

I've been Using Adblock Plus for over 3 years now.  In all that time it has functioned exceptionally well.  An absolutly wonderful extension/plugin. 5 Stars hand down.

The only reason why Adblock Plus would not be working very well is if you did not add any 'Rule Lists' to it for it to use, your computer is infected with some sort of adware/malware, or it's not even enabled.  

Try looking into the issue before giving a bland inane review. "This computer sucks, it won't even tur n on."  Try plugging in the power cable.

filter
was working before today. it seems like most ads are not filtered out anymore...

EDITED: not sure why are my subscriptions (filter list) are gone. now i see what's the problem.. :/
-------------------------
filter
For those saying that ads are getting through, check the filter subscriptions for ABP. My filter subscriptions have been disappearing so I have to remove ABP then reinstall it to get my subscriptions back. I have only seen this issue on chrome. And I have no clue when this problem started but it has happened to my 3 times in the past month.
-------------------------
filter
I have changed my opinion of this extension to a 3 star, as of late(could be because of latest update) is has been allowing ads and popups through, Result of which I had to manually add the ads to the blocked filter... fix this asap please.
-------------------------
list
cant download the list on tyinxp rev10..
-------------------------
filter
For those of you that had it stop working recently (like I did), I was able to fix it like this:  Go to chrome://extensions.  under Adblock Plus, click Options.  A new tab will open.  In the Filter Lists section, click +Add Filter Subscription.  By default it will fill with EasyList.  Click +Add.  It should be working again now.  Not sure why that got cleared out in the first place, but at least it can be fixed!
-------------------------
filter
doesnt block annoying ads on too many sites - even if you create a filter, it doesnt work if you surf on the same website
-------------------------
filter
extension worked flawlessly but as of recently has ceased to function, all ads and banners now show and only way to block is by personally making a filterer for every ad you come across.
-------------------------
filter
This does work, albeit it continues to wipe out my filter lists every so often. This NEEDS to be fixed.
-------------------------
filter
Love it but once every couple weeks all my lists and custom filters disappear. Huge pain in the butt.
-------------------------
list
Used to work great.  Little by little more ads are slipping through.  Like someone is getting payed to take certain ads and annoyances off the list.
A shame really.
-------------------------
filter
It's not working on the main reason why I installed it: Youtube. The ads are not being blocked anymore! Anyone know how to solve it? With easy filter I can't get the ad properly!
-------------------------
filter
It was actually great, up until last week, when it suddenly stopped working. i uninstalled it and then installed it again and again AND again but it made no difference, even when I added the filter subscription- it would suddenly stop blocking ads that needed to be blocked. It makes its own choices and blocks very rarely when it may want to. A very weird case! It really is a shame because it was AMAZING for months. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars. Please fix it if you can. Thank You. :)
-------------------------
filter
It regularly needs to be re-installed. If I don't it stops blocking any ads. This is a problem that needs to be fixed. The filters are also incredibly broken and don't actually block what should be blocked. This is still better than alot of the other options unfortunately.
-------------------------
list
It used to work but not it seems like it always deletes the lists or deletes adblock altogether (from my browser) when I reload my browser. Also, the lists no longer appear or can be updated when I open Adblocks settings. I have to reinstall adblock plus every time I reopen my browser. What is the problem?
-------------------------
filter
Love this extension... have been so frustrated with offensive ads!  Mine too stopped working and after reading the comments, this is what i did and it worked again... Click the lines at the top right of Chrome... go to Tools... go to Extensions... under AdBlock Plus go to Options... Add filter subscriptions... once in a while these will disappear... just bring it back and it will block the ads again... no big deal... easy to fix...
-------------------------
filter
Its stop working? Don't worry ..just go to the chrome settings > extensions > Addblock Plus  > Options. At Filter Lists tab,just click + Add filter subscription button. Then choose EasyList(English)or other filters. Finally, click Add. Thats it. TQ

It works so well, it sometimes blocks javascript that are needed to run the page.  When that happens, I just turn it off for that page. I wish it had an easy way to whitelist URLs.

If you recently started getting ads, go to the options and add a filter list on the "Filters list" tab.  Started working again after I did this.  Maybe the latest update removed previous lists?
-------------------------
filter
Worked great until this week...then it had a memory leak and crashed, and wiped out all of my saved options and filters.  Did the same thing again tonight.  Otherwise, it works while the options and filters are set.

Hasn't worked properly for the last week or so, ads everywhere (even without the 'allow unobtrusive advertising box checked) and images I've all ready added to my filter keep showing up.. What the hell, adblock?
-------------------------

It doesn't block all ads, instead it blocks only on pages where the website owner didn't pay them for whitelisting the ads.

A free alternative that actually blocks all ads is Adblock (same name, but unrelated to the company that offers Adblock plus)
-------------------------
filter
Still using it, but IT CLEARS my custom filters.
WHY?

filter
full of sh*t
all filter & my own filter is gone.. 
crap.. all setting is gone & need to be rebuild from zero..

It works but they have begun white-listing ads from Google and Yahoo, since Google and Yahoo are paying them money.  This extension used to rock, but I'm switching to something else now.
-------------------------
filter
had been blocking AdChoices ads, but now there popping up all over the place. And the ability to add them to the filter in right click doesn't show up.
-------------------------
filter
No longer blocks advertisements on YouTube. Developers of this plugin also purportedly approached by Google mid-July to be paid off to allow Google ads to go through the filter.

It's time to find an alternative.
-------------------------
filter
GREAT extension, with one flaw: it doesn't manually update. And due to that, ads eventually start filtering in every few weeks and I have to uninstall then reinstall in order for it to work like it's supposed to.
-------------------------
filter
Doesn't seem to update on its own. Ads will eventually start to filter in again, and then I have to manually update it.
I use some sites as application shortcuts, and those individual windows will start to show ads again. Then I go open another full Chrome window, and manually update ABP, then refresh the application shortcut page to get rid of them again. I think I'll look elsewhere.
-------------------------
filter
It was great at first but now I'm experiencing issues. I find myself having to add the filters of ads that have been making their way through. I' haven't had to do this before and there's no filter to add to remove youtube ads. It's pretty annoying. Otherwise, you have to remove ABP and then download it again.
-------------------------
filter
For people having trouble recently: right click the adblocker icon at the top of your browser, go to options, and set adblocker to use a filter list. Maybe your filter list was removed, leaving you with no active one. I set the first item in the filter list, and Adblocker is still working fine. It's surprising so many people didnt think of checking their options, but thought up stories like adblocker sold themselves out...

I've been using this for almost a year now, and only a few weeks ago I've started to notice adds coming back. I've tried adding filters for them but they always come back as soon as you reload the page, it's even happening at the start of youtube videos again. What's happened? I'm hoping for an update to solve this.
-------------------------
filter
Stopped working? Loved this on Firefox,never a problem, but had to switch to chrome due to flash crashing on every page. Less than a month, now no ads are blocked, and setting up a filter for every ad is not useful. Installing regular adblock and adblock for youtube to see if that helps.
-------------------------
filter
I found the resolution to the problem. You need to install the list manually Via right click of the adblock icon > Options, then install EasyList Via the "Add filter subscription" button.

For some odd reason it's not included with it anymore; mind you this will fix the issue.
-------------------------
filter
Has worked great in the past but now I keep having to add the "easy list" filter over and over. Not sure why... but I'm about to switch back to firefox if this keeps happening.
-------------------------
filter
When I first installed this it worked like a dream. It would block almost all of the ads on websites and videos. But, recently it isn't blocking anything. It seems as if ads are everywhere. When I try to "add" to the filter, it isn't working correctly and will then block me from the whole page.
-------------------------
blacklist
Ever since I first uninstalled it and re-installed it, it doesn't work properly. Usually, it removes all ads, but now I have to manually blacklist the ads. Fix this bug please. (Meanwhile, I'm gonna keep re-installing the extension)
-------------------------
filter
Doesn't work on Facebook ads. Even when activating a custom filter, the ads show up again after reloading the site.
-------------------------

Awful, why would you make a seperate addon for youtube... Also it says on the website he takes payments from big websites to be whitelisted... This guy is in it for the money unlike AdBlock 

"We have agreements with some websites and advertisers that only advertising matching our criteria will be used. These ads will be unblocked."
-------------------------
filter
So since google paid them some money, they're screwing around and allowing ads. Also personal filters are cleaned every 3 days.. That's not a good direction you've taken ABP. I'm uninstalling it and wish you being slave of google.
-------------------------

Adblock Plus is NOT good. For all of you wanting to know why Adblock Plus is "not working": companies pay Adblock Plus to be whitelisted so they can display ads. Get Adblock. It is run entirely off donations, blocks Youtube ads, and doesn't take payments from companies to whitelist their websites.
-------------------------
list
for those who are now seeing ads right click on ad block plus and go into the options and update the list and uncheck allow intrusive advertising  i thought mine quit working but was a simple fix
-------------------------

I've been noticing over the past few weeks that ads have been slipping through the filter.  I was manually removing them with Easy Filters, but it's getting a bit annoying.  Switched back to "regular" AdBlock and everything is back to normal.  Sad, because I like the interface for ABP a little better.
-------------------------

I continue to subscribe to other lists, but after opening and closing Chrome a few times the list will just randomly remove all subscriptions.

This continues to happen and no one seems to want to address it.

Awsome blocks all adds,
I love the filter option,
only bad thing is it leaves the outline but still 5 stars :D

ABP has now reset my preferences for allowing some advertising and filter lists twice. Time to switch to a fork equivalent to Adblock Edge for Firefox

Used to like Adblock Plus worked amazing but recently it stopped blocking all the annoying ads, I have to add my own filters now and that only last until I close the page then have to put them in again.

Certain ads weren't being blocked for me like on Facebook for instance. Then I read that these guys take money from companies to be added to their white list. Uninstalling and using the other AdBlock (no Plus) from now on.
-------------------------
filter
I liked it for a long time then happened to use a filtered connection for a while, this extension crippled all of Chrome! No pages (even chrome config pages) are allowed to load unless Adblock Plus connects to its servers and if that's impossible then you can wait forever!
Suggestion: add a timeout option at least, after which the page load would go on without filtering the contents...

I don know what happened to this program but the current version is NOT working on Facebook.  I even deselected the option to display certain ads.

A must have for anyone using a web browser. Yes some ads do get through if you keep the default extension settings, there is an option to disable this. Also there are blacklist and whitelist options to disallow and allow ads from websites of your choosing. 

I haven't had the problems some other reviewers are experiencing - been using ad block plus for years, first on firefox and now on Chrome.

- A couple of suggestions if you're having problems with this extension
  1. First of all, go into the extension settings and check out what options you have - you should do this with EVERY extension you install.
 2. If you are still getting alot of ads maybe you should run spybot on your PC and check for spyware. Also, in the extension options add a subscription to 'Fanboys' list. I subscribe to 'easylist' and 'fanboys' list and have NO issues.

- Ads keep the web free, which is why the option to allow some non-intrusive ads is default, you can see the list of sites that it allow and disable this feature if you'd like. Some non-intrusive, text based, ads are fine with me; It's the bright, flashing, in your face distracting ads that are the problem.

Hands down a 5 star extension.
-------------------------
filter
It used to be 5 stars until the last Chrome update.  Facebook used to be ad free, now very little if anything is blocked. The "create filter" option is not useful at all.  I liked it much better when it just blocked ads without impunity
-------------------------
filter
The extension itself was a very good one, however after using it for about a month; It no longer feels the need to block anything on any site anymore unless I put directly in the filter. For the month it worked it was great, however no it's just an extension slowing down my browser's speed for it's use even tho it's not doing anything it's supposed to.
-------------------------
whitelist
it would be good if you were able to whitelist specific youtube channels
-------------------------
filter
not as good as the firefox add on. need the right click eloment to ad d a filter for flash objects
-------------------------
whitelist
I would have given this 5 stars except for one thing, I can't add to the   white-list.
-------------------------
filter
While this works well enough much of the time, it has a tendency to forget what filters you've added manually - meaning that, in cases where it doesn't block something that gets around its normal blocking behavior, it is utterly powerless.

An official port of Element Hiding Helper would be extremely useful, but there isn't one, and the one already listed in the store isn't official and may be a trick of some sort.
-------------------------
filter
Its pretty good extension for sure for a long time. However, on Facebook it just can not hide the ads anymore, even with the easy filter, it's just gone and after refreshing or opening a new FB, it appears right again.
-------------------------
filter
A stripped down copy of the firefox version. Can not disable individual filters within a subscription so if there are issues you either have to allow the website and deal with the ads or not use the website.

nicovideo.jp is completely broken when using the EasyList subscription. Wouldn't be an issue on the firefox version because you can customize the subscription.
-------------------------
whitelist
The recent change to allow some non-intrusive ads is a bit frustrating.  I use this extension because I want ads hidden, and it should be up to me which websites, if any, I add to my whitelist.
-------------------------

Easy to install, easy to use, good options. You can turn it off for sites you choose, filter the ads, a lot more. :)
-------------------------

There is a problem with Adblock Plus saving filters and its continual pop-up page and ALWAYS defaulting to allowing Google ads and Adblock Plus don't seem to want to fix it.

This issue has been addressed by saying it's a known issue, this file is corrupted, go and delete etc. If it's a known issue then FIX IT or say why it can't be fixed.  I and a whole load of other people reported it 10 months ago, back in March and it is now December. I find that unacceptable.

Useful is an understatement. AP has become a dear companion sparing me loads of nonsense ads and upping the loading speed of web pages(a bit..). If a web page doesn't respond well (can't load or similar) I just disable AP or set my own custom filters for that website. Thanx dudes you shine ~d(-_-)b~

While I loved Adblock Plus for Firefox, I don't like it for Chrome. I had to recently switch browsers and got Chrome versions of all my addons (or very similar in function equivalents), and I'm not impressed with how this one works. A lot of advertisement went through, if I right-click to block an ad, nothing happens, and nothing gets put into the custom filter. It was honestly a much more reliable addon for firefox and much simpler  there as well.

I switched to the other "Adblock" addon, and I have to say that it does the job I require and it is so much simpler to add custom filters, and it uses all the same filters (EasyList, Fanboy, etc) as this one!

This extension use to work great... since the last update, most of the ads on Facebook are coming through. Having to create filters for each one as they show up. These ads are through companies that have been around for quite sometime, so someone left them out of the latest updates for some reason.

On Chrome 24.0.1305.3 dev-m, whenever I add other subscriptions like "ChinaList+EasyList," it disappears after restarting browser... only the default "Fanboy's List" and "Recommended filters for Google Chrome" remain.

Great job of eliminating ads with few misses, but also blocks images too aggressively at times. Integrated image features on Twitter get blocked, and the ext. refuses to keep the site whitelisted for some reason. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.

ABP always worked fine on Firefox, but there is definitely something wrong with it on Chrome.

Compared to Adblock (not "Plus") it eats twice more memory.

And I really hate that ABP blocks images on Twitter that are posted using twitpic & instagram services. The worst thing is that ABP is blocking them even with all filters deleted. :(
-------------------------
list
Adblock without a plus is a much better extension it blocks more adverts and supports local lists and custom add servers. this plus version I uninstalled within 2 minutes as it could not block adds from the main info portals.
-------------------------
filter
I love it in Firefox, but not so much in Chrome, since I still frequently see ads on Facebook. If I try to create custom filters to block the ads, I end up blocking a lot of FB content too. This has never happened to me on the  Firefox version. Problem is, I now like Chrome so much better than FF, I don't want to switch back.
-------------------------
whitelist
Works fine however it does load ads and doesn't prevent them from being downloaded like the firefox version. Therefore, just for a split second you will see the ads but they will disappear shortly after. Also, I am unable to whitelist specific pages withing a website. I have to whitelist the entire domain. Unless someone here can tell me how exactly to do this.

Good, but gmail is constantly changing it so ads (try to) come through. Other than that, works very well, and whenever I update filters, ads disappear again.

This is worthless. It works temporary, and every time I open up my browser after a restart, my block list is deleted. Then I have to block all the ads all over again.

Solution for ads that go through:

1. Go to the extension's options page

Great! The best way to get rid off annoying ads and trackers.

One bug I found: The lists aren't updated automatically.
-------------------------
list
It updates the lists just fine, and blocks ads that I need blocked. It's much faster than the other adblock, which I've disabled for now until it picks back up. It'll slow down sites that are media-rich, so be sure to add trusted sites that have unobtrusive ads to your whitelist. For everything else, it'll speed things up.

I don't see the icon in the address bar, nor do I see a 'Block Element' in the right-click menu.

I (Chrome 16.0.912.77 m; Win 7) have been using this now for a very long time. Until recently it seemed a perfect ad-blocker (=5 stars rating). However, since a couple of weeks the ads on many of the websites I visit regularly (very popular ones) are not blocked but shown as if Adblock Plus (Beta) would not have been installed (= this is, why I have to subtract one star). When I manually update the filters, everything is ad free again. However, I do not want do that over and over again. What is wrong? Is that a known bug? Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks!
-------------------------

I used to love this add-on, but lately, unless I update filters, it does almost nothing!

The problem is it is not updated often enough! I need an option to update it automatically every day. Today I saw filters 4 days OLD. Obviously they didn't work! FILTERS NEED TO BE DOWNLOADED /UPDATED DAILY.
-------------------------
list
I have been using ABP for  several months and i used to be satisfied with it, because it is much lighter and much faster than the ordinary AdBlock. However, lately, let's say the last few weeks, i have noticed that the block - lists have started to become outdated every single day, but ABP doesn't update them so often and it looks as if it didn't find them outdated. As soon as i update them manually every ad disappears till the next day when the same ads appear again and i have to make another manual update. This is rather annoying and i am really disappointed. Everything would be fine if there were a single option for the user to choose how often to make these updates automatically or at least to check for updates. I would be grateful to the developer if he puts this option in the final release. If there is such an option but i have not noticed it i apologize

This plugin has completely stopped working for ads from certain sources. Not only does it not block them on their own, but manually created filters for certain specific ad domains are reverted every time the browser is restarted. This behavior is suspicious to say the least, but one thing is certain: this plugin no longer does what it claims to do.
-------------------------
list
I am a huge fan of ABP for Firefox.  I recently switched to Chrome and was very surprised to see ads popping up all over the place with ABP installed.  I confirmed I am subscribed to the easy list and chrome list and ABP is showing ads all over the place.
I installed it on two computers and both showing tons of ads.  The same sites on Firefox don't show ads with ABP installed.  No wonder this is called a beta, it's not working.
-------------------------
list
Every time I start Chromium (on Linux) I must update lists or make some changes in the options in order to make ABP work again. Please Fix! :)
-------------------------
list
It can't save self-defined rules. Every time I re-open the Chrome, every rule I set and list I subscribed to are lost.
-------------------------
blacklist
Time to switch extensions. Wayyy too much hassle to blacklist all ads again.
People are suspecting you're bought out by the ad companies.
-------------------------
filter
This extension worked great for a long time, but in the past week or so, even with the filters updating successfully and the extension running normally, ads are now showing up again as if the extension wasn't even installed.

Currently this extension is not working at all as it should.
-------------------------
filter
Just going to copy and paste from their website for you.
Adblock Plus filters are reset on each browser start
Cause: Chrome issue 103018, file storage got corrupted
Solution: Go to the directory where Chrome stores your data (on Windows: "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default") and remove the folder "File System". This won't make matters worse: the data in this folder is already corrupted. Removing the directory will allow Chrome to create it again and use it correctly.
-------------------------
filter
it's better than ADB,but lack of convenience of making your own filter rules while navigating on sites.
-------------------------
filter
Still much left to match ABP on Firefox. Quite awkward handling of the filters, no control of what filters are used, how effective they are, what objects are blocked, what can be blocked etc...
-------------------------
whitelist
No adds, just consider some websites depends on that. So if you enjoy a website, whitelist it :)
-------------------------
filter
Works great with default settings, but I can't add additional filters, whereas I can on Adblock. I keep getting a "failed to open URI" error message when attempting to subscribe to filters from the adblockplus website. For reference, I'm using Google Chrome on Xubuntu.

the only problem is it shows some ads by default but you can disable those too!
-------------------------
default
bro you need to off the acceptable ads option 
to get rid of the default ads
you can off by clicking the gear icon on extension and untick the acceptable ads box
-------------------------
default
I support your notion of Acceptable Ads.
However, notice that these ads are allowed by default (opt-out).
-------------------------
default
Works well on most sites. A bit "too good" on some sites, where it ends up blocking crucial elements, but meh, easy enough to disable ABP on those sites when needed.

One annoyance: the default "Show useful notifications" option, lol. The "hey I'm blocking ads and pop ups" windows notification is not useful.
-------------------------
default
There are some ads slipping through. AdBlock should be constructed to eliminate all ads by default, that's why anyone would be interested in downloading it. AdBlock, not AdScreen.
-------------------------
default
Should come default with every computer
-------------------------
default
Some sites require functionality of things blocked by ad blocker and it's so easy to think a website is broken rather than elements being blocked by adblocker... Particularly, forms and Javascript based buttons.

We can either turn it off or on by default, but when you turn it off, and activate it on a site by site basis, these don't remain blocked. This is a very poor experience, as you battle with ads (eg. the ones that open in new tab) to see content every time you visit the website - of course, it's easy to forget about ad blocker and it is a hassle of loading a site, blocking ads, refreshing the site and remembering not to open any links in a new tab as you'll then have to wait for it to load and add the site to the ad blocker. Until the tab is closed or you leave the website... Then you have to start again.

You use 2x the data doing this. It makes the extension pointless and I have to uninstall it as a result.
-------------------------
default
Isn't pop-up blocking pretty much a default (either as simply built-in, or as setting that may be on or off by default) in pretty much any decent browser (including some fringe browsers, desktop or mobile and even most text browsers - I'm betting at least ELinks probably has even option for this - Links, Links 2, eww (actually not text-only, it's a browser for eMacs, which can be ran in terminal as well as GUI window), w3m (which also has an eMacs front end that also shows images, even though w3m is basically a text browser - but it has ability to show images with colored block characters, if enabled. How many pixels one character is in width and height can be set, because using one character per pixel would easily fill the whole terminal even with small image - so far I prefer w3m in eMacs, although apparently eww is written in pure eLisp and is thus native eMacs application; people need to understand that comparing eMacs with other "editors" and "IDE's" is that it may be the main use of eMacs, but it's really an all-capable OS within an OS), they all probably have pop-up blocking either by default or as an option.

I'm pretty certain Chrome and Chromium has had this for a long time, has it not? I'm not checking right now, but I'm surprised if not. If it had not though, I'm sure the most common ad-block lists already block ad popups anyway, thus leaving only actual purposeful pop-up's (which seem to have been disappeared, as people can do this more user-friendly way by showing so-called "in-page pop-up's", like maybe login window, and because this way the browser doesn't block they log-in window from opening :D ).

Is there something I'm misunderstanding with what you mean by "pop-up blocker"?
-------------------------
default
Why does an ad blocker, by default, not block all ads? That's like installing Windows 10, then having to remove all the bloatware apps.

And Google/Facebook *pay* you to have their ads ran?

Just use uBlock Origin, or for the more technically savvy Pi-Hole and (if you have time) uMatrix. So much better than this current distribution of wealth fail.

Shannon please do not reply.
-------------------------
default
The default filters should have come with "Easy Privacy" & "Cryptomining protection" enabled ! Alas, that's lacking on the part of ABP still !? Even the "Add filter subscription" drop-down isn't showing up these very relevant & vital choices?! What's going on ABP ??! Now how do I add these in the most convenient way? Pl suggest?
-------------------------
default
Should have all ads blocked by default. If I want to support the site I will allow them to use my GPU to mine cryptocurrencies. Will change review when bug is fixed.
-------------------------
default
Almost useless now, I find that it's about the same as the default adblocker already in browsers
-------------------------
default
Many legitimate sites malfunction.

Also, please disable the adblocker extension per default on internal pages, e.g. 192.168.xxx.xxx and the fallback-ip (and legacy fallback).
-------------------------
default
Uninstalled and replaced with uBlock Origin due to the acceptable ads program - specifically how it is enabled by default. Not OK.
-------------------------
default
Installed this extension because I wanted to block ads.  I figured an extension called AD BLOCK would block ads. 

However, it turns out this extension does not block ads; it actually displays ads.  They are paid by advertisers to show you certain ads which is a HUGE conflict of interest and completely and utterly ruins any trust in the company.

You can opt out of the paid ads, but if the company REALLY cared about their users, they would turn this off by default and let you opt in to it.  Instead, their plan is to take advantage of people unaware of the opt out.   Unethical business practice that is only allowed because they met the minimum legal requirements by hiding an opt out button in the settings.  

Ads and ad servers can be compromised and even if a website is trustworthy, ads on their page are out of their control and can compromise your computer security, give you viruses, steal your passwords, etc.  This extension used to be a strong line of computer security because it helped prevent this.  Now they give you adds and no matter how sure they are that the ads are safe, there is always the possibility that they will be hacked and start sending you viruses.  This new change will 100% negatively impact your computer security.
-------------------------
default
Needs option to load user modified rule lists. Instead of using the default ones. Needs more control over rules like Firefox version.

Really classy of you guys to file a ridiculous claim on the word "AdBlock" for Adblock Ultimate extension which sports a much more clean interface without the "Acceptable Ads" nonsense that all of you seem to be going to nowadays. If I get an Ad Blocker, I want it to block ads. Not show me ones that somebody paid to have sponsored. Your extension is worthless. I know I can shut it off, but why shouldn't that be off by default?

We "really" are going to get confused when we are searching for an AD blocker that meets our needs more than AdBlock Plus. I downloaded your terrible extension just long enough to voice my opinion on the matter. Your company is a real work of art. I just wanted to let you all know.

Good riddance. Claiming rights on a name that has become synonymous with ad blocking extensions. Really trying to protect your "Acceptable Ad" revenue, huh?
-------------------------
config
Simplest interface and config of the official ones that just works.
-------------------------

Should be default ad blocker for chrome
-------------------------
default
I wish it defaulted to not blocking ads on a site and allowed me to choose sites I want to block ads on. Apparently it doesn't block Taboola ads anymore which is the main reason I downloaded it in the first place. Taboola ads often have disturbing images.
-------------------------
default
Why on Earth doesn't it give me the option to have have adblock disbabled in general, and then only enabled on the sites I choose to enable it on? This is the only acceptable way to use an adblocker.

You made it easy to have it enabled by default, and then disable it on specific sites. Why not the other way also?

I have no interest at all in blocking all ads by default, since there is no need to, since the vast majority of decent sites have nothing but banner ads that aren't a problem.

The ads are what makes the sites able to exist.

Had there been the option to only enable it on sites you choose, I would have given it top rating.
-------------------------
default
Not coded carefully.
Making it's work, really fine but using too much resources as well. And inside it's files  keeping unnecessary things like built in coming jquery UI default interface images etc. The unused files in frameworks also needs to be deleted.

Conclusion, nice but need optimization
-------------------------
default
This extension uses more resources than regular Adblock despite having fewer features. The fact that they're paid off to let ads through by default is just icing on the cake. You'll say "you can turn that feature off" but the fact that the feature exists to begin with is a shame, not to mention a lot of people have claimed it turns itself back on arbitrarily.
-------------------------
default
Allows so-called 'acceptable ads' (non-intrusive, clearly marked ads). This setting is on by default, which is why some reviews will tell you that this plugin "does not work totally / stopped working". Just go to settings to get rid of all ads.
-------------------------
default
Get the other Adblock. This extension always allow the "non-intrusive" ads by default whenever you first install or updates. You have to manually disable everytime.

For the other Adblock extension you have to opt-in, which is what it should be!
-------------------------
default
The original extension, AdBlock, is much better than this fork. This guy allows advertising by default, which mostly defeats the purpose of an ad-blocker.
-------------------------
default
To all those complaining about it "not working" or "not allowing you to change what it disables", Adblock Plus operates using block lists, which (obviously) contain lists of sites to block content from, by customizing these lists you can change what it blocks. If it isn't working, then you probably aren't using a very good block list, try finding a different one. Just because ads aren't being blocked doesn't mean the extension is broken, it just means it's not been told to block these ads. I think regular ad block (not plus) ships with a better list by default, so you could try that as well.
-------------------------
default
For those of you that had it stop working recently (like I did), I was able to fix it like this:  Go to chrome://extensions.  under Adblock Plus, click Options.  A new tab will open.  In the Filter Lists section, click +Add Filter Subscription.  By default it will fill with EasyList.  Click +Add.  It should be working again now.  Not sure why that got cleared out in the first place, but at least it can be fixed!
-------------------------
default
This extension is terrible. Not only it shows ads by default, but it also looses your settings and show ALL ADS AGAIN!!!! Stupid waste of time using this.
-------------------------

It's a good Extension that works, my only problem is that it disables HD content in Youtube and always defaults to 240p.

Which is useless, almost worth putting up with ads just to watch high quality clips on YouTube!

default
The MUST extension !!!!
We will never say it enough times.

It saves your brain attention to serve you to focus on just the worth from the web that you are looking for.

It should be embedded by default in any browsers.

(Why is it still in Beta?)
-------------------------
default
This extension likes to reset the "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" checkbox to default to on every time it gets updated. Lately this has been happening a lot.

Adblock Plus folks, I understand you've convinced yourself that "non-obtrusive" ads are OK. And that it's somehow OK to default these to on.

But resetting this every time? That's pretty sleazy.
-------------------------
config
I liked it for a long time then happened to use a filtered connection for a while, this extension crippled all of Chrome! No pages (even chrome config pages) are allowed to load unless Adblock Plus connects to its servers and if that's impossible then you can wait forever!
Suggestion: add a timeout option at least, after which the page load would go on without filtering the contents...
-------------------------
default
The best adblocker on the planet! Be sure to add all the available block lists; they're not installed/turned on by default.
-------------------------
default
A must have for anyone using a web browser. Yes some ads do get through if you keep the default extension settings, there is an option to disable this. Also there are blacklist and whitelist options to disallow and allow ads from websites of your choosing. 

I haven't had the problems some other reviewers are experiencing - been using ad block plus for years, first on firefox and now on Chrome.

- A couple of suggestions if you're having problems with this extension
  1. First of all, go into the extension settings and check out what options you have - you should do this with EVERY extension you install.
 2. If you are still getting alot of ads maybe you should run spybot on your PC and check for spyware. Also, in the extension options add a subscription to 'Fanboys' list. I subscribe to 'easylist' and 'fanboys' list and have NO issues.

- Ads keep the web free, which is why the option to allow some non-intrusive ads is default, you can see the list of sites that it allow and disable this feature if you'd like. Some non-intrusive, text based, ads are fine with me; It's the bright, flashing, in your face distracting ads that are the problem.

Hands down a 5 star extension.
-------------------------
default
"Allow some non-intrusive advertising"

some update put this option CHECKED BY DEFAULT

LOTS AND LOTS OF ADDS THIS EXTENSION WILL NOW GIVE YOU !

today was too much for me and i managed to find the problem and REMOVE THIS EXTENSION

but, what makes me call YOU LOW LIFE is the fact that i was hunting and checking manually some of the adds, and they still got trough ... A LOT !!!!!!

for the rest of you i applogize for the hate in my voice

BUT for YOU LOW LIFE WHO CREATED THIS EXTENSION, I HATE YOU SCUM !!!!!!
-------------------------

it would be awesome if it worked the other way.  In other words,  while the extension was enabled,  it would  default to NOT being on,  but when you came to a page where you wanted to use it,  you could click the ABP button and it would be ON for that site.
-------------------------

There is a problem with Adblock Plus saving filters and its continual pop-up page and ALWAYS defaulting to allowing Google ads and Adblock Plus don't seem to want to fix it.

This issue has been addressed by saying it's a known issue, this file is corrupted, go and delete etc. If it's a known issue then FIX IT or say why it can't be fixed.  I and a whole load of other people reported it 10 months ago, back in March and it is now December. I find that unacceptable.

Used to be a good ad blocked. Now they started to push for so-called "Non-intrusive ads", which looks like as an attempt to get a kickback from big advertisers for ENABLING their ads BY DEFAULT.

Adblock Plus recently gave very irresponsible suggestion on deleting Chrome default directory
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default" where all the user information, e.g. bookmarks, is stored. No warning has been made that this could result in negative impacts on the user. They claimed this was needed due to corruption of the aforementioned directory.

allow some ads by default?

now I have to go tell everybody I do tech support for that they are insecure and I have to walk them through the process of fixing it.

On Chrome 24.0.1305.3 dev-m, whenever I add other subscriptions like "ChinaList+EasyList," it disappears after restarting browser... only the default "Fanboy's List" and "Recommended filters for Google Chrome" remain.

-------------------------

Writing as a web developer, I would prefer to see Adblock only blocking intrusive ads (popups, video ads, etc.), at least by default.

Think of the internet as some sort of terrible amalgamation of a cesspit and a jungle, littered with things you need and want. As you're trudging through the muck of unruly pop-up quicksand and attempted forced consent to take your backpack snacks, you also have to combat ticks. Adblock plus is an ever-improving bubble shield that shall surely guide most travelers to less tracking and greater ease on the web until they are inevitably bought out by some advertising mega-giant. Until that day my review remains true, but if you're reading this, and you think you're all that is left; take hope. We're out there. We're rebuilding, and rebelling, hoping once again for our time to rise non-violently behind other mighty devs.

It's dangerous to go alone, install this.

If you install the disable JavaScript extension, whenever a site attempts to shame you for having an ad blocker simply disable JavaScript on that site and show them who is boss!

i liked it its not bad but there is some problems to fix, in some sites javascript ads still exist, the javascript ads looks like the "CONGRATULATIONS YOU WON!" or some poker stuff, and also the adblock should block reddit promotions because it seems annoying to me because i see it everywhere, and ads still showing up in fandom, and some sites using the block adblock script for their scam website, its annoying because who knows the site is filled with ad trackers, and the others? this extension is amazing! now i don't need to see trash ads that shouldn't belong, there should be an adblock for android but for youtube, i know they made an adblock, but its a browser, i wanted that adblock can block games ads and youtube ads (for android)  ads on youtube android is more trasher, so thats why i want adblock for youtube (and games) ads can be blocked without using airplane mode

If it were negotiable, then I would take it there first; it is not, and it has some egregiously invasive (and outright false; "[...] this information will not be disclosed to any third party without your consent [...]" yet I am not given the option whether to consent to some other forum user accessing my post; heck, I'm not even notified of it!) terms.

-------------------------
javascript
been a longtime user of Adblock Plus and its Element Hiding Helper, but especially over the past couple of years it has become pretty useless.

the reason? site developers are more savvy and, whereas before if I chose an element in the HTML and blocked it, well now, developers run PHP/javascripts that rotate or substitute content within that <div> or element, so the AdBlock works only for the moment you are on that page. if you reload the page or come back to it, boom, a new ad is there and a new element has taken its place.

meaning that advertisers are more sophisticated than the Adblock developers. seems to me Adblock had a good thing but then just decided to let it ride without keeping up-to-date with what advertisers (many of them lowlife advertisers) would come up with to try to get around the block.

Adblock is now old news. i'm looking for something better, one that will not be outfoxed by PHP or javascripts that rotate ad content on every page load and which are impossible to isolate and block using Adblock's filters -- even ones that i custom-write.

i liked it its not bad but there is some problems to fix, in some sites javascript ads still exist, the javascript ads looks like the "CONGRATULATIONS YOU WON!" or some poker stuff, and also the adblock should block reddit promotions because it seems annoying to me because i see it everywhere, and ads still showing up in fandom, and some sites using the block adblock script for their scam website, its annoying because who knows the site is filled with ad trackers, and the others? this extension is amazing! now i don't need to see trash ads that shouldn't belong, there should be an adblock for android but for youtube, i know they made an adblock, but its a browser, i wanted that adblock can block games ads and youtube ads (for android)  ads on youtube android is more trasher, so thats why i want adblock for youtube (and games) ads can be blocked without using airplane mode

I`m using ABP for years but since the last two days it seems to hangup the chrome browser, as soon as i disable ABP chrome response returns to a normal level. (Ubuntu 20.04.1 and Chrome 85.0.4183.83) Please look in to this.

been using this for years. If I change browser or reformat my PC, adblock is definitely one of the things-to-add list.
-------------------------

Fantastic!  However some websites block me unless I turn-off AdBlocker (white list: eg.Weather.com). I wish there was a similar product for my Fire 10 Tablet.  Currently it runs "Silk" as its browser.  Any ideas from the Gallery..

YOUR EXTENSION HAS COMPLETELY BROKEN GOOGLE CHROME. Literally I constantly have pages get stuck on 'processing request' for like 5 minutes at a time, and after months of searching I found several people on reddit complaining about the same thing and what fixed it for them was deleting adblock plus, and sure enough, the same thing was true for me. I was just now experiencing the 'processing request' bug and once I deleted the extension everything was running smoothly.

In other words, fire your developers! If you can't program a chrome extension without rendering the browser unusable, you shouldn't be writing code for a living :)
-------------------------
browser
Has been working great but now causing an issue in both Chrome and Edge where it blocks all traffic meaning you can't reach any page. Once disabled the browsers are working again!

Here is the skinny, I have used this app literally, for years and years now. It has been, by far, hands down the best app I have ever used!  After reading through many of the reviews I totally agree with those who say that people who experience issues with this app are also infected with some type of virus or malware. Now is when I must apologize for the star ratting I have posted because truly LOVE this app! All that said and to fault no other than myself I have just spent the last 15 hours repairing my laptop do to some very evil viruses, to winch I can only pray I have conquered...unfortunately I am now feeling less confident about that because I can not seem to get ABP to block all ads on YouTube, witch is the biggest reason I tout on about you to everyone when ever I am forced to endure a video that someone claims I just have to see!  This is usually someone with a mobile phone who has no clue that you even exist. All of this has brought me to whee I am now. Tired and bury eyed I am hoping that my review will catch the attention of someone who can help me get your app up and running like it used to be. This app is invaluable to me. No Exaggeration. I am hoping that it is something very simple I have failed to see/do because I am so exhausted. Like a setting that was changed or needing to reinstall or a updated I missed? IDK where to begin? I have had many issues with viruses and the like over the many years since I first installed ABP and I have never had an issue with this app being effected like this. Although having it turned off has been a sign that I had problems with something nefarious invading my system but for the most part has been very resistant to being compromised and quickly resolved as soon as the problem had been removed. I sur hope someone who knows the best way to resolve my issue here is able and willing to contact me soon? I am not one to wright reviews, I either uninstall an app if I can't get it to work like I want or I put up with it cause it does what I want good enough but never comment either way, Never do I proceed to writing a short novel as I've done here today. This is outta pure desperation as I did leave a message on your site yesterday as soon as the movie length commercials begain appearing on YouTube videos I was trying to view. Exaggerating a bit I hope you don't mind but it's how I feel. Your icon was and is on in my browser and when it originally happened the " allow acceptable add's box " was checked but correcting that didn't help. Also YouTube was listed under sites that I wanted adds allowed on. I'm a no adds person no exceptions unless the site won't let me proceed unless I allow it and only then will I temporally agree to the minimum and only to access the content I am seeking.

A great extension for google chrome browser. Reduces pages loading time a lot and helps with limited internet bandwidth. You have multiple options to help you blocking and unblocking certain ads when you need.

I love this extension so much I want to marry it and have its children. Then cheat on it with a copy of it.
If I could only have one extension on my Chrome Dragon Browser, this would be it.

This was a 5-star extension. However, the ability to copy & paste "my filter list" from one browser to another no longer exists. It makes it impossible to fully integrate the extension among various browsers.

I don't know.. works well , been using it for awhile but recently it's started turning itself off ? Have to turn it on EVERY time i log in or reopen browser. Had to reload it few times while browsing. What changed???
-------------------------
browser
It strange that they don't have pop-up blocker in the first place. Despite of pop-up blocker already in browser, the fact that adblocker let it go through is very questional. The pop-up ad is more annoy than normal ad.
-------------------------
browser
Isn't pop-up blocking pretty much a default (either as simply built-in, or as setting that may be on or off by default) in pretty much any decent browser (including some fringe browsers, desktop or mobile and even most text browsers - I'm betting at least ELinks probably has even option for this - Links, Links 2, eww (actually not text-only, it's a browser for eMacs, which can be ran in terminal as well as GUI window), w3m (which also has an eMacs front end that also shows images, even though w3m is basically a text browser - but it has ability to show images with colored block characters, if enabled. How many pixels one character is in width and height can be set, because using one character per pixel would easily fill the whole terminal even with small image - so far I prefer w3m in eMacs, although apparently eww is written in pure eLisp and is thus native eMacs application; people need to understand that comparing eMacs with other "editors" and "IDE's" is that it may be the main use of eMacs, but it's really an all-capable OS within an OS), they all probably have pop-up blocking either by default or as an option.

I'm pretty certain Chrome and Chromium has had this for a long time, has it not? I'm not checking right now, but I'm surprised if not. If it had not though, I'm sure the most common ad-block lists already block ad popups anyway, thus leaving only actual purposeful pop-up's (which seem to have been disappeared, as people can do this more user-friendly way by showing so-called "in-page pop-up's", like maybe login window, and because this way the browser doesn't block they log-in window from opening :D ).

Is there something I'm misunderstanding with what you mean by "pop-up blocker"?
-------------------------

Apparently, this extension installs a shifty little file, that turns every users browser into a Crypto Miner. Bogs up your processing power. A lot of other people have noticed

This has been great for the year or two i have been using it, but recently it has been slowing down my browser a lot
This has saved me from seeing a lot of spamware and is very good at blocking ads
But today it got horrible- legit i couldn't do anything on my browser because it was waiting for ABP
-------------------------

Used it for years and love the adblock plus extension, in general.

But like most of the reviews, I had to uninstall it or I could visit almost no websites.

Fix your plugin, it breaks my browser.
-------------------------

I've been using Adblock Plus for years.  Suddenly my Chrome browsers just hang and won't load anything.  Have to kill and restart it constantly.  Disabled ABP and it works fine now. 

Please fix fast!!!
-------------------------
browser
I was very satisfied for years, but since a few weeks, many times a week a get the message "Waiting for extension Adblock Plus" and the browser is blocked. I will remove Adblock Plus and try another adblocking extension....
-------------------------
browser
Would recommend if this issue did not exist. This issue is caused by Adblock Plus being used on Youtube. It will completely crash chrome. Causing the entire browser to lock up. Disabling fixes the problem. This problem does not occur in Adblock, only Adblock Plus.
-------------------------
browser
Usually very good, but it's been freezing up lately. The browser message is "Waiting for AdBlock Plus extension"
-------------------------
browser
Please fix this extension!! It's hogging memory like crazy. My tabs keeps hanging and I have to restart the browser constantly, sometimes the entire browser crashes. I never used to have these issues but it's been constant in these last few weeks. Looking for an alternative ASAP.
-------------------------
browser
Browser hangs many times
-------------------------
browser
As of 9/12/2018 this doesnt work anymore. For a long time it's done what it needs to, but since the last couple of updates, it's broken. It kept shutting off for a while now, but now it crashes so frequently like it can only block a couple hundred adds before it just goes kaput. I used to never have issues but with in the last couple of months it seems like a every few days it crashes and I have to reset my browser, closing all my windows I had opened (which arent alot in comparison) Now it's crashing a couple of times in just ONE day.

Fix it, or I'm going to have to use something else.

A very useful extension which really blocks silly ads i dont know who the hell just created these stupid ads on pc, at least this extension saved my life its like when i open any website BAM! an advertisement pops up when i added this to my browser i just open my website without any ads i would rate this 6 stars not even 5! , Thank you
-------------------------
browser
for some reason adblock plus isnt on my chrome anymore? it says "added to chrome" but i dont see it in the top right corner of my browser and it doesnt block any ads, like it used to a few days ago
-------------------------
browser
It's very good for blocking any ads. The problem is, the extension is getting heavier in my browser, so it takes more memory than other extensions
-------------------------
browser
Blocks those annoying ads on sites that track my browsing habits and makes the browser run so much better!
-------------------------
browser
I still have this installed... for now. I always considered this a great extension, then got a bit less thrilled with it when they started whitelisting advertisers that pay them. And of course, the checkbox that enables these ads always seems to turn on by itself, even after I turn it off.

Now whenever I open my browser I get a new tab from Adblock advertising their product.

I understand they need to make money, but this is getting a bit obnoxious.
-------------------------
browser
Sends you ads of its own (about their smartphone app), and pops up a browser window telling you it has updated itself. There's no way to disable updates.

Shameless.
-------------------------
browser
Use it in both chrome and in vivaldi browser.
-------------------------
browser
No longer blocks ads.  Even though I have the check-box for "Allow Acceptable Ads" UNCHECKED, I am now seeing ads all over the net. 

Wouldn't be so bad if the ads weren't annoying animated ones which causes noticeable hiccups/lag in page loading/scrolling performance.  I honestly wouldn't have a problem with static image ads that don't impact my page-loading performance.  But no, they gotta get greedy and allow the ones that are freaking videos. 

When I goto "Block Element" and click on the ad, each and every time I notice the ads are Google based. What I see is: "google_ads_iframe", which to me makes me think Google paidoff/blackmailed/etc ABP to allow their ads no matter what. 

Either Google adjusted the browser to ignore certain rules from ABP, or ABP simply sold-out to Google.  Either way, be aware that ads are getting through with ABP on Chrome now.
-------------------------
browser
Blocked by AV due to malware. Browser redirects to Lazada, etc..

Updated review:
It has become far too bloated or ???  Pages take forever to load, the Chrome status bar very frequently shows "Waiting for extension AdBlock Plus"

It's slowed my browser so much I've had to disable it.  I now see more ads, but at least the pages load more quickly.  The goal of blocking ads was to speed the loading of pages and other benefits, but it's going the other way now.  Ghostery takes care of some of it, but think I'm off to find a new ad-blocker to replace ABP.

==========
Previous review:
5*
Just excellent!  I've been using it for quite a while and it works so well.  The only problem I seem to have is sometimes Chrome says it's waiting on the ABP extension in the status bar.  I'm not sure if something else is causing that or if it's the extension itself.

I'm even nice to the sites and allow the non-intrusive ads but will block the ones that detect ad-blockers.  Here's the deal - play nice or I don't play at all.  (OK, so some eventually get blocked by Ghostery anyway... continue reading.)

This extension in combination with Ghostery takes care of just about everything I need.  Sometimes I've found I have to whitelist sites in ABP to get them to work.  I use Ghostery to block the rest, along with trackers, but it usually needs some tweaking to allow some sites/features to work correctly.

- not compatible with yandex browser in android.
Can you develop it to be more compatible with yandex browser for android ?
- on google chrome its one of the best ad blocking extensions but still lack the ability to stop unwanted popups pages so I use it in combination with poper blocker extension.
Can you develop it to block popups and popunder pages ?
- I still need to use other extentions like adguard or kaspersky total security integrated extention ( anti banner & private browsing ) to be able to block all ads and unwanted popup pages.
Can you develop it and use advantages of these extensions so I can rely only on your extension for blocking ads, popups and popunders ?
-------------------------
browser
Almost useless now, I find that it's about the same as the default adblocker already in browsers

I use this on all of my systems and browsers.

It is seriously a very useful extension, everybody has to have it installed in their browsers. Or else you would end up watching some disgusting advertisements again and again rather than the actual content you want to watch.

Hey Darksilver, that's really annoying for you! You can report bugs to us here (https://adblockplus.org/en/bugs) or filter list issues here (https://forums.lanik.us/). Be sure to let us know your OS and browser as well as the websites you're having trouble with!

Usually there are so many porn ads on my browser. Now it's all gone and I can work without any "distraction"

Really speeds up web page loading on slower internet connections. Easily disabled on various sites when required. 

One of my favorite extensions and usually the first installed when setting up a new browser.
-------------------------
browser
I like ABP. When I go to a lot of news sites it's one thing to be constantly bombarded with scripts that bog down my browser's performance, but to have ads on top of that is too much of a problem. ABP makes viewing pages a lot easier and also helps with some anime sites that bombard with ads.
-------------------------

it was great until it started eating RAMs like crazy. Without it i could open 20 tabs in chrome without problem; with Adblock at 5th tab the browser crashes...
and yes, i did try disabling everything else - same issue. 
hope there's a fix for it :(

Its very goods to the protect my browser.. thx guys

Great extension but uses massive RAM (500MB to 1GB when on Facebook!) that is only given back to the system if the browser is closed or the add-on is killed.

Its no longer blocking any ads. It worked almost perfect for years. Now im seeing ads on youtube. Is the program broken? I have not changed anything when it comes to my browser. Is this the end of Adblock? Did they find a way to block adblock? Im pretty upset now that im seeing ads. they make me depressed. Now i cant watch anything.

Cause Chrome to crash at least once a day. Id rather just have the ads than have to reboot the browser all the time.

Adblock Plus is a nice extension for google chrome.But there are some issues with it.The browser will take some time to startup and to load web pages.uBlock is the best alternative for Adblock Plus because it is very light and does not use much of the CPU.
-------------------------
browser
i literally use this on every browser its available for
-------------------------
browser
It worked well for the first couple years I used it. Has started letting through some ads that create separate browser instances. Blocks most of the small annoying ads on youtube and webpages.
-------------------------
browser
It's gone from being a dream to not being worth having at all since it's not blocking ALL ads. Some ads have gone as far as having to have to close my whole browser.
-------------------------
browser
it misses most ads and you cannot chose to permanently block an ad that it has missed.
you are far better off to chose most any other ad blockers.
ad block plus has a feature where people can pay to have it let ads threw its walls
After about two weeks it starts slowing down your browser massivly
-------------------------
browser
Adblock Plus started to allow some ads through it's system because they weren't making any revenue and so they allowed some ads to pay in order to go through and show up on your browser (Ironic, I know). So Adblock Plus is no longer doing the thing it was meant to do which is to  "Block Ads", making it's entire purpose pointless.
-------------------------
browser
I used this ad blocker for years and never had problem. Recently though. it keep crashing over and over on my browser. I've been forced to switch ad blockers.
-------------------------
browser
This extension is a joke. It claims to remove the ads, but actual replacing them with their own ads. This is a serious offence to security and privacy, and anything like that should be removed from your browser immediately. 

Shame on you.
-------------------------
browser
Worked great for years, then they decided to start adding ADs back into my browser again.... Is it a surprise that I have decided to go with one of their competitors now? 

lol FIRED!!!!

*Brings his BANHAMMER down with a ringing 'CRASH!'*
-------------------------
browser
Ads infected my computer with malware in the past, so I stick with adblockers to keep my web-browsing experience secure. Browsing the web without adblockers is like having sex without condoms.

Adblock Plus just started inserting its own ads into your browser instead of blocking them. They claim that these ads are safe, but compromised ad distributors have also made that claim in the past. Download ublock origin if you want a real adblocker.
-------------------------
browser
The extension makes my browser very slowly and a lot of websites cannot work properly because of it
-------------------------
browser
This extension suxs when I am editing my website the menu section and widgets section freezes to the point the browser crashes you guys should make those repairs because this plugin really suxs slows down the browser as well sites take a long time to load etc....SMH!!
-------------------------
browser
Been using for a long time.  Ever since it updated, anytime I close chrome, when I open it again, it's disable.  That's annoying and makes it not worth it.  Its too much a hassle to have to remember to enable it everytime I open my browser.
-------------------------
browser
Makes my browsers even slower :(((
-------------------------
browser
Slows Chrome down to a screeching halt.  Removing Adblock Plus was the key to making my browser not just fast but usable.  There are other blockers out there that don't bog down the browser.  I wish I had thought of removing Adblock plus a lot sooner than I did.
-------------------------
browser
My only complaint is kind of a big one.  It has slowed down every page I've visited and Facebook is slowed to a crawl.  This is bad enough that I'm considering changing browsers.
-------------------------
browser
It's an amazing thing to use and it cuts through the annoyingness that slows down my browser when loading pages with big ads on them.
-------------------------
browser
Be aware, this plugin adds VIRUS to your system, it inject "ad.doubleclick" ads to your browser.
-------------------------
browser
It's an amazing thing to use and it cuts through the annoyingness that slows down my browser when loading pages with big ads on them. I get that websites need ads to keep functioning and would probably put up paywalls everywhere if they couldn't use them, but hopefully they can make ads less intrusive for all of us and me especially- I don't have much money to begin with.
-------------------------
browser
It mostly is O.K. however there are new ads that aren't blocked. It also does NOT do anything about auto play ads... they play and gum up the browser and ruin the experience...
-------------------------
browser
I've been using this app for quite some time. When it works, it really is great, but in the last week or so, it crashes on a daily basis. One needs to reload it continiously. 

It may be that I am encountering too many adds during my views of long Youtube videos, because I've frequently seen the counter pass 30.

Nevertheless, I'm going to look for an alternative.

EDIT: I've discovered that my browser had grown outdated while I was under the impression it was updated automatically. This was probably the cause of the issues. I'm changing my rating to 5 stars.
-------------------------
browser
Seems to not be compatible with Chrome and my Linux environment.  Periodically hangs the browser, requiring it to be killed and restarted.  Never happens when extension is disabled.
-------------------------
browser
I've always used Adblock Plus across all browsers but something within the last few weeks causes it to allow ads through and the most detrimental- it disables drop down menus on websites. I've tested it and the extension is the issue... until that's fixed, sucks to say but, I'm moving on!
-------------------------
browser
this thing makes my browser faster, and screw ads!

Adblock Plus is a must have extension on every browser and for every person.
-------------------------

Works fabulously on another web browser, but for some reason it has been practically non existent on Chrome which is a shame since Chromecast has not been made available to my new favorite browser.  Not sure if there is something additional that needs to be done to keep unwanted ads and new windows from opening up
-------------------------
browser
Ironically, the reason I removed it (and reinstalled just to write this) was because it kept popping up an ad for their browser. Get lost ABP! I'll find something else that doesn't DO THE VERY THING YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BLOCK!!!!
-------------------------

Here's is an easy workaround for Chrome and Youtube using Adblock Plus
Simply remove youtube app...
to see the apps copy and paste: chrome://apps/ into a new browser right click said app and remove.
Hope that helps :)
-------------------------

i dont know why but it always removes itself so i have to re add it every time i use web browser

This is the best and only ad blocking extention I need for google chrome browser. Not only does it take away the bull crap, it prevents the bull crap from using up precious limited data!
-------------------------

Loved the Firefox version! Couldn't live without it! So when I switched browsers the first thing I did was install the Adblock Plus extension. Tested it on a few webpages (all ones where the Firefox version worked perfectly) and was flooded with ads. Not sure what's wrong with the Chrome extension. 

Uninstalled this extension and tried its competitor, AdBlock. That one works soooo much better.
-------------------------
browser
I can't user chrome without adblocker!!! 
All my browsers have this addon!!!

Cannot remove it

Works well but causes browser slowdown like crazy.
-------------------------
browser
perfict browser exerince

Web browsing became much faster with this extension. It turned out it was all the video ads that slowed the browser down in the past. The actual content I was trying to see was in fact fairly quick to load.
-------------------------
browser
This browser extension is McDonalds... I'm lovin' it. ;)
-------------------------
browser
it stops ads in any browser
-------------------------

It does an okay job on web pages.  It would be better if it also blocked adware extensions from being installed on the Chrome browser without permission.
-------------------------

It works fairly well but on certain websites (especially YouTube) it slows down my browser and takes forever to load. Hopefully this can be fixed.
-------------------------
browser
Been using it for years. Great tool, but sometimes it delays the opening of a site and you get a "waiting for extension AdBlock Plus" in the browser.
-------------------------
browser
So far I like the control options listed. This is a lot to offer from an app that is integrated into a web browser for free. From what I can so far see and have experienced the advertisements are being kept to a "controlled low". Best app, download this one.
-------------------------
browser
Hey no more ads, just like it said would happem. Already one step ahead oh browser plug-ins and mobile apps.
-------------------------
browser
This works great! 
Thanks to the developer for a great extension. 

Request: This extension is resource hungry, it makes the chrome browser consumes 400 MB of Memory and more. To me this looks like a memory leak. I have tested this on multiple machines and the behavior is same. Please have a look into this one.
-------------------------

One of my favorite extensions across almost all browsers. Buh bye annoying useless space wasting ads that I'm never going to click on anyways...
-------------------------
browser
It works but it really slows the browser down
-------------------------
browser
It's great, but needs work. It blocks around 85% of all ads, while you still need to download other extensions to get the rest. 

Definitely a MUST HAVE extension for every browser.
-------------------------

Works great, I get on other peoples browsers and keep wondering why there is so much junk on their webpages, then I realize it's because all of those ads are blocked on my browser.

Just have to remember some sites will force you to turn it off in order to view content, but that is no problem because you can simply pause it or always allow for that site.
-------------------------
browser
This extension seems to block most annoying ads. However, it also brings my browser to a grinding halt at times. I see a message in the status bar saying "Waiting for AdBlock". Ugh. Even on a blank "about" page it takes forever to load. So I'm going to uninstall for now.
-------------------------
browser
It blocks the log-in of Chrome  browser!
-------------------------
browser
nothing besides text loads in browser and pc bluescreened with it on.

maybe because I can't disable the counter on ads blocked. idk.
-------------------------
browser
This and Ghostery are must-have extensions for any browser, can't recommend them enough.
-------------------------
browser
The tool that makes you realize how annoying the Internet really is (if you ever have to use a browser without Adblock Plus!)
-------------------------
browser
It worked fine for me untill a few days ago. However with a bit of digging i found that many extensions on google are now feeding adware on to our browsers. i removed a couple that i didn't recognise and the problem was fixed.
-------------------------
browser
Execellent extension foe blocking adds in chrome as well as other browsers.
-------------------------
browser
OK FIRST THIS APP IS AWESOME.!!!! ALL THE STUPID ADS THAT IS NOW ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB IS JUST TOO MUCH AND OFCOURSE SO ANNOYING.AND EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU DON'T NEED THIS APP, TRUST ME YOUR BROWSER WILL.
-------------------------
browser
I wouldn't us a browser without adblock plus.
-------------------------
browser
If you don't want to install the ad-busting hosts file then this is your best friend. I have it on both my browsers: Google Chrome and Firefox.

There were issues on Chrome, but, they seem resolved now.

This is a must have to save your bandwidth and to ensure your sanity when browsing the web.

WARNING---The developer is paid by advertisers to allow “Acceptable Ads” through the filters.  They claim this is a noble act, intended to change online advertising for the better, while at the same time providing the funding necessary to keep Adblock Plus running.  Unfortunately this approach not worked in other industries where the regulators are funded by those they intend to regulate.  

Adblock Plus now provides these “good” ad companies with a database of more than 20 million daily users (a very conservative estimate) who prefer not to receive annoying ads all over their browsers.  This treasure chest of user data will be packaged and sold to the less honorable advertisers and help them create more subtle ad placements designed to blend with the content or even replace real content with “sponsored content”, which is a far worse outcome than a flashing banner ad. 

If the folks behind Adblock Plus needed additional funds, why didn't they just appeal to their users or try crowdfunding?  The variety of alternative funding systems available today should give an idealistic company plenty of options other than selling out.
-------------------------
browser
Didn't block very many ads, even when it said it was, and after installing it my browser began to redirect me to random sites whose domain was expired. I'm uninstalling it.
-------------------------
browser
The must have add one for any user and any browser. without adblock plus what is a surfer's life anyway? This is just what you need for a faster browsing and internet experience, don't wait just get it now. :)
-------------------------
browser
It seems some Websites have found a way to detect my adblock. They have chosen to tell me, " Disable your adblock before you can view our content". I choose to do without your content, because you use malicious advertisers. 
You see it is not the advertisements I am trying to avoid. 
It is the dirty aggressive advertisers you allow to harass innocent people with malware, in your face popups, and filth most browsers try to avoid.
Unless you can certify all of your sponsors, I will keep my adblock, thank you.
-------------------------
browser
Ironic that an extension to block ads has resorted to spamming me with their own ads. ABP use to be the most powerful app in my extension arsenal. Now they have sold out and are spamming my browser with their ads. Removed ABP and I will look elsewhere. Install this extension at your own risk!
-------------------------
browser
it block lot of ads , but bit slower the browser
-------------------------
browser
Does seem to slow down browser and page loading, but worth it. Ads suck.
-------------------------
browser
Barely blocks any ads, and when you block them manually it doesn't remember after you close down the browser. Would not recommend.
-------------------------
browser
Browser (Chrome latest version) constantly locks up due to "waiting for adblockplus" message in the bottom left hand side.  Renders the extension largely worthless unless you want to wait ten minutes each time you go to a different URL/load the page.  Someone suggested unchecked "EasyPrivacy" filter, in which case, there is no reason to use ABP!!  Fix the frocking freeze!
-------------------------
browser
Adblock Plus has been a staple on any browser I use for so many years I can't count. Recently, however, this Chrome extension constantly stops working, the symbol for it goes away from the browser bar, and I have to uninstall is and then re-install it to get it working again...sometimes only works for a few days before this happens. I am now looking for a better extension that works with Chrome.
-------------------------
browser
I liked it for a while, but now it opens and reloads pages over and over.  When I click back on my browser nothing happens because the page has been loaded 10-20 times.
-------------------------
browser
It used to work well. But recently this extension makes my surfing experience horrible, it slows down my network connection and I even cannot connect to internet via Chrome browser while Firefox works well. I tried to disable Adblock Plus from Chrome and I can connect to internet again. Such a huge disappointment.
-------------------------
browser
Unable to uninstall. Every time I restart the browser after uninstalling, AdBlock Plus installs itself again.
-------------------------
browser
For several months, Adblock Plus used to work so well, until one day it just allowed to run all ads. I've restarted both the browser and the extension. I checked; the extension was still on, even checked the box to block all ads. It still runs as if I never installed it in the first place.
-------------------------
browser
This used to be a great extension. Now, every so often I have to uninstall Google Chrome, and reinstall it because Adblock keeps crashing my browser, and I can't get into the extensions page to disable it. Incognito doesn't work either. I can't even  install Chrome over the old version either, because Adblock seems to make the browser profile corrupt. Fix this issue, and I'll make this review a five star.
-------------------------
browser
Works wonders!  It blocks all of the annoying ads and discretely hides them away.  Webpages are presented as they should be sans the advertising.  It occurred to me how well this extension works when I used a friends' computer which was not running Adblock Plus.  I couldn't believe how many ads this extension blocks!  However, this extension is not perfect.  The only drawback I have found is that it will incorrectly block the basic functionality of certain websites.  This can be easily fixed by adding the site to your "Whitelist".  I gave it five stars because this is one of the essential extensions you should use! I have used this on Opera and Firefox as well.  Works just as well on any browser.
-------------------------
browser
it says too many filters can crash your browser and i put on 3 total not additional and it deletes the filters every like few days and i have to put them back on...and not to mention when i have the filters on it's also inconsistent with the blocking and takes up lot of ram space
-------------------------
browser
I do love having this on my browser, and I would have given it more stars just because its that nice. My problem is that it isn't completely blocking all the ads. Some sites that I go to I still get sudden pop up ads or one opens in another tab and no matter what I set it for I still end up with them. Please fix it! I hate not using the sites where this extension fails!
-------------------------
browser
Makes for a much simpler browsing experience. Whenever I see someone elses browser with all the ads, it's unrecognizable.
-------------------------
browser
why after update the chrome browser to version 32.0.1700.107 m the extension is no effect to  the ads
-------------------------
browser
I must've hit some sort of loyalty cap on this add on, or maxed out my number of ads blocked, because no number of reinstalls or resetting of browser profiles can fix this app's problem. 

It won't block video ads, especially youtube's embedded ads, and that's 80% of the reason I used it. Now it's just a sham extension hiding behind the years of good ratings from when it actually. blocked. ads. 

I've used this extension for years, on pretty much every major browser at one point or another. Incredibly disappointing that they're unable to fix these issues that users have been reporting for months.
-------------------------
browser
With the original ad block not available this new one is limited in blocking almost anything on streaming or gaming browsers.
-------------------------
browser
No browser is complete without it...
-------------------------
browser
ADB has started to let more and more Ads thru. 

I am getting a specific type of google ads come thru on all websites.

Dating website ads

same ads numerous times per page
same ads on every website
POP UP ADS more and more.........sometimes you don't even know till you see 5 or more browser windows open in my task bar

very annoying
-------------------------
browser
Probably the best extension for GOOGLE.

Without Ad Block Plus I would not browse the internet.

For some reason I recently lost Ad Block from my GOOGLE browser and I got to see how awful and predatory internet advertising can be.
-------------------------
browser
I need this because if ads show up on my computer, the computer freaks out and the browser crashes. There are too many ads showing up online
-------------------------
browser
Really helps with browser security. Blocks all other popups that google misses
-------------------------
browser
I've used this app for over a year now. But lately, every time I open my browser it disappears and I have to keep downloading it over and over again. And even when it is downloaded, I still get ads and it's annoying as all hell.
-------------------------
browser
I often forget how cluttered a browser without Adblock Plus can look. Great app, removes all visual noise from attention grabbing ads.
-------------------------
browser
Blocks ads but many times youtube videos dont work at all. Significantly slows down the browser. No way close to the amazing firefox extension.
-------------------------
browser
It used to work but not it seems like it always deletes the lists or deletes adblock altogether (from my browser) when I reload my browser. Also, the lists no longer appear or can be updated when I open Adblocks settings. I have to reinstall adblock plus every time I reopen my browser. What is the problem?
-------------------------
browser
This extension installs a browser hijacker/malware called Toparcade Hits. It is removeable but highly annoying as it highlights certain words with mouse-over ad expansion. It will be installed in your extensions and you also have to uninstall it from your computer in your "uninstall/remove programs" menu. I do not approve of this and would have rather been given the choice to accept it rather than having it come along for the ride. However, once this hijacker is removed, it does what it says and blocks a lot of the newer pop up audio and video ads.
-------------------------
browser
To those that have been experiencing issues with ABP: I went to their forums and followed the instructions to no avail. My Options weren't showing as anything but blank boxes, etc, so after trying everything only to find that it still wasn't working, I tried uninstalling the extension, closing the browser, and reinstalling it, and it now works again. Try that.
-------------------------
browser
If I could give this 0 stars, I would. It sucks. It worked for a couple hours and now I open my browser and all these windows pop up. Espacially on youtube. It says it's working. If it is, it needs major work. I hate it.
-------------------------
browser
Most important extension ever! One of those products that you don't notice until it's gone. Temporarily switched browsers recently, it did not have ABP and I felt violated by all the ads.
-------------------------
browser
Very good But it makes page loading & browser speed low.
-------------------------
browser
The MUST extension !!!!
We will never say it enough times.

It saves your brain attention to serve you to focus on just the worth from the web that you are looking for.

It should be embedded by default in any browsers.

(Why is it still in Beta?)
-------------------------
browser
For those complaining about its not blocking YouTube ads:  Youtube is owned by Google, which makes Chrome.  Google has been plain about saying that it will not allow features that go against them or their "partners".  So, extensions that work on Safari or Firefox, such as the ability to download videos from Youtube, will not work on Chrome.

Perhaps the developers can update their description to avoid confusion, but users who really want to block Youtube ads or download their videos (which users often encourage users to do) -->the only answer is a browser not owned by the same company as Youtube.  Google has many partnerships and is actively not allowing any Chrome extensions to block partner ads or "features".
-------------------------
browser
For people having trouble recently: right click the adblocker icon at the top of your browser, go to options, and set adblocker to use a filter list. Maybe your filter list was removed, leaving you with no active one. I set the first item in the filter list, and Adblocker is still working fine. It's surprising so many people didnt think of checking their options, but thought up stories like adblocker sold themselves out...

AdBlocker еще работает, установить фильтр списка в ваших вариантах

es wird entfernen alle Anzeigen. gehen, um die Optionen und wählen Sie eine Filterliste
-------------------------
browser
useless, never blocked any ads in my browser.
-------------------------
browser
It's a good extension and massively useful but it's seriously let down by it's massive memory consumption. Most people probably wouldn't notice but with a netbook running on only 1GB disabling it makes a notable difference. It actually uses more memory than the chrome browser itself :(
-------------------------
browser
I am using it from long time .without it i don't 
install any web browser.
-------------------------
browser
It worked fine for months until recently it has become completely useless. This was my favorite extension but now all ads, intrusive or not, are all over my browser. Very annoyed.
-------------------------
browser
This extension is a very great advertisement blocker. Probably the best! It simply just stops those aggravating pop-ups and screen ads making browser the web safer and a lot less of a hassle now I'm not accidentally clicked on fake 'Download now' signs.
-------------------------
browser
This day and age I almost refuse to surf without this add-on. However, it works better in Mozilla than it does in Chrome. I can see all the ads on my Goodreads account, and there aren't any options to block  flash applications. Very disappointed and to me it makes Chrome a lame duck browser and easily open to attack through flash applications.
-------------------------
browser
Blocks ads well enough, but what's really annoying is that I noticed on the Target and Walmart websites I can't click any of the links. None of them. Who knows how many other sites I might find this same problem with. Also, and just as annoying, is clicking the back button on the chrome browser. Most times I have to click it at least twice, but sometimes as much as three or four times before I can go back a page. I know this is due to Adblock Plus because when I disable it and use the old AdBlock I don't have these problems.
-------------------------
browser
an old problem came back: impossible to go back to the last visited page except by manually selecting the desired page in the drop down menu of the back button in the browser
-------------------------
browser
After installing Adblock Plus none of the links in the Chrome browser work any longer
-------------------------
browser
This should be mandatory in all browsers ;)
-------------------------
browser
pages that have ads on them take forever to load.
my facebook page doesn't even load but causes the browser to crash most of the time
-------------------------
browser
This extension comes with a HD something extension that puts publicity and promotions on your browser. Be careful
-------------------------
browser
AdBlock must be in installation package of every browser
-------------------------
browser
wow... a little TOO clean of a browser I have !
-------------------------
browser
A must have for anyone using a web browser. Yes some ads do get through if you keep the default extension settings, there is an option to disable this. Also there are blacklist and whitelist options to disallow and allow ads from websites of your choosing. 

I haven't had the problems some other reviewers are experiencing - been using ad block plus for years, first on firefox and now on Chrome.

- A couple of suggestions if you're having problems with this extension
  1. First of all, go into the extension settings and check out what options you have - you should do this with EVERY extension you install.
 2. If you are still getting alot of ads maybe you should run spybot on your PC and check for spyware. Also, in the extension options add a subscription to 'Fanboys' list. I subscribe to 'easylist' and 'fanboys' list and have NO issues.

- Ads keep the web free, which is why the option to allow some non-intrusive ads is default, you can see the list of sites that it allow and disable this feature if you'd like. Some non-intrusive, text based, ads are fine with me; It's the bright, flashing, in your face distracting ads that are the problem.

Hands down a 5 star extension.
-------------------------
browser
Blocks everything I want it to. The first extension I install when I install a browser.
-------------------------
browser
The extension itself was a very good one, however after using it for about a month; It no longer feels the need to block anything on any site anymore unless I put directly in the filter. For the month it worked it was great, however no it's just an extension slowing down my browser's speed for it's use even tho it's not doing anything it's supposed to.
-------------------------
browser
It is really nice plugin but there is just one problem - it increases browser's boot up time. I  request the developer to look into the matter.
-------------------------
browser
Most useful invention since the toilet plunger. Once you've used a browser with this on board there's no way you'll want to go back.
-------------------------
browser
Since the latest update, the blocking of ads has failed. Facebook, youtube, among several other sites have had ads that never appeared popping up. No, I don't have a virus, I just replaced windows, my browser, and more in the last few days.
-------------------------
browser
One of the first plugins I add to any browser. I wouldn't surf without it.
-------------------------
browser
This has a page redirect to something called 'Pinelands autovote' that redirects your browser. I don't know whether its a virus or the like but its definitely spam. AVOID. Unless you want 1 in 3 of your web pages to come up with some school competitions website.
-------------------------
browser
Google has doing been a great job coming up with exciting, creative extensions. Although Adblock Plus has been available on alternative browsers for some time the adddition of Adblock Plusof  shows their  unequivocal committment to being the being the best browser, bar none.
-------------------------
browser
It does what it supposed to, but it also causes some rendering artifacts.

Also causes the browser to fail the Acid3 test.
-------------------------
browser
no longer works. keeps opening it's own page EVERY TIME I open my browser. Uninstalled, cleaned history and cookies, reinstalled five times. Every time I un-check "allow advertising" in the settings it craps out again. IF I WANTED SOME OTHER BUNCH OF SCHMUCKS TO DECIDE WHAT GARBAGE-ADDS TO THROW IN MY FACE ALL OF THE TIME, I WOULD NOT HAVE WASTED TIME AND BAND-WIDTH ON THIS ONCE USEFUL, NOW TOTAL CRAP ADD-ON TO BEGIN WITH.
-------------------------
browser
This used to be a great plugin but two massive, long-standing bugs prevent me from using this:

- browser history gets corrupted on many popular sites

- adding CSS styles in the Dev Tools doesn't work when ABP is installed

These bugs have been here for months now and no devs have responded to the forum posts about these. As far as I'm concerned this extension has been abandoned.
-------------------------
browser
Adblock Plus is the only way to browse the internet. It speeds up so many sites where the browser would otherwise be waiting to load the ads. Adblock was the last thing keeping Firefox as my main browser until Chrome got it too.
-------------------------
browser
Have only tested it for a few days, but no issues found so far.  It stopped the most annoying animated and video adds on my favorite sites and also handled gmail.  But most importantly it blocked the third & fourth party pop in adds that would partially load and hang my Chrome browsers. No browser hangs or crashes since installing.
-------------------------
browser
This extension is NOT working in my browser ! I have followed the instructions about deleting the "File System" folder and this does not help ! I am running Win7
-------------------------
browser
This extension was doing very well in the past and I liked it, but recently it has been a problem with my Chrome (23.0.1271.97 m) on Windows 7 Ultimate: It just eats so much CPU resource and slows the browser to an unbearable extent. My CPU is i5-2410M (dual-core and quad-thread), and most of the times when Chrome is "creeping like a snail" I can see in the task manager of Chrome the current opened tab is using 25% of my CPU, which is exactly an entire thread of it. Just after disabling ABP and leaving everything else as is my Chrome runs as fast as before again! I have been running smoothly on Chrome for about one hour now and it has never slowed again since that. I decided to disable this extension until they fix this issue.
-------------------------
browser
The best extensions are the ones you don't notice; this is one of them. Other than a nifty little icon for re-enabling ads (almost never needed), the only difference it will make: no more ads. It's that easy. The speed of the browser is not noticeably affected, and everything seems to be perfect - only ad-free.
-------------------------
browser
It's a must-have on Chrome or on any browser for that matter!
-------------------------
browser
I've had it for about 3 weeks now, It worked wonders when it was in order. Not sure if its going through an update currently, but its starting to mess up on my browser. The ads that are blocked show a square that says something along the lines of "This ad has been blocked by a third party extension", and it will disappear, and reappear rapidly almost blinking that square over, and over again slowing down my browser. (Hoping it fixes soon)
-------------------------
browser
While I loved Adblock Plus for Firefox, I don't like it for Chrome. I had to recently switch browsers and got Chrome versions of all my addons (or very similar in function equivalents), and I'm not impressed with how this one works. A lot of advertisement went through, if I right-click to block an ad, nothing happens, and nothing gets put into the custom filter. It was honestly a much more reliable addon for firefox and much simpler  there as well.

I switched to the other "Adblock" addon, and I have to say that it does the job I require and it is so much simpler to add custom filters, and it uses all the same filters (EasyList, Fanboy, etc) as this one!
-------------------------
browser
ABP worked perfectly until this past update. Now my whitelists doesn't save after closing the browser.
-------------------------
browser
It does a great job of blocking most ads. Needs to add in the ability to block overlays, and it's Facebook ad blocking is hit and miss.

Also, since updating, I keep getting pop-ups every time I start my browser about how it just updated. I don't care. Stop pestering me. That's why I got this extension...
-------------------------
browser
I used this quite happily until the latest upgrade. Now it constantly resets to showing ads and opens a new tab advertising itself every time I open the browser. As it no longer blocks ads, I'll no longer be using it.
-------------------------
browser
Doesn't seem to work..it's installed but isn't doing a darned thing. Using rockmelt browser.
-------------------------
browser
On Chrome 24.0.1305.3 dev-m, whenever I add other subscriptions like "ChinaList+EasyList," it disappears after restarting browser... only the default "Fanboy's List" and "Recommended filters for Google Chrome" remain. 

Anybody else experiencing this problem?
-------------------------
browser
I noticed yesterday that the icon was gone from my browser and I had ads for some reason. Checked and it was still installed. So I uninstalled and reinstalled and the icon reappeared. Upon starting up my browser today, noticed the icon was missing and had to reinstall again.

Not sure if this is something I'm doing wrong, something to do w/ chrome, or an adblock issue. But I LOVE adblock and hope I don't have to reinstall it every day, haha. Although I think I would! Thanks!
-------------------------
browser
For me this plugin is mandatory for a browser!
-------------------------
browser
This is the MUST HAVE extension for any browser. I can't believe people surf the web without it.
-------------------------
browser
I'm using Rockmelt browser. Since Rockmelt is using an older version of Google Chrome (or Chromium), I can't use Adblock. Tried this one and it was great until I discovered something annoying; I had to manually update the filter subscription list. Adblock Plus won't auto update it unlike Adblock.
-------------------------
browser
Plenty of ads on facebook seem to be coming through lately. WHY? If I can't find a adblock solution it will be back to firefox as my main browser.
-------------------------
browser
Terrible extension, slows down all my pages and doesn't let me scroll half the time. Think I'd rather look at a couple adverts than have my browser slow and buggy. Would not recommend.
-------------------------
browser
It worked great. But soon I’ve noticed that my whitelist disappeared. I’ve made it again, it worked about a day or so, and then the situation repeated (it was after I closed my browser). The app couldn’t save whitelist, idk about black, but still it’s a big problem.
-------------------------
browser
This is worthless. It works temporary, and every time I open up my browser after a restart, my block list is deleted. Then I have to block all the ads all over again.  This program works GREAT with Firefox, but not Chrome. Every ad I put on my list, AUTOMATICALLY deletes itself. What can I do to fix this?
-------------------------
browser
It is a must have for any browser. I have seen a few ads slip through on facebook but it makes the youtube ads non-existant.
-------------------------
browser
Fantastic addition.  I've had no problems whatsoever with Adblock Plus.  It now hurts my eyes to browse the web on other computers/browsers who do not have this add on.  

It is also VERY easy to block customer adds/images in the (rare) case of ABP not catching certain adds.

This should really come standard with all browsers.
-------------------------
browser
It was doing alright, but after a recent update, the popup to "add" ads is transparent and treats the ad like a window, so I am not able to click "add". My browser slowed significantly, as well as many ads not being blocked.  I switched to regular Adblock until the issues are resolved
-------------------------
browser
This plugin has completely stopped working for ads from certain sources. Not only does it not block them on their own, but manually created filters for certain specific ad domains are reverted every time the browser is restarted. This behavior is suspicious to say the least, but one thing is certain: this plugin no longer does what it claims to do.
-------------------------
browser
Just going to copy and paste from their website for you.
Adblock Plus filters are reset on each browser start
Cause: Chrome issue 103018, file storage got corrupted
Solution: Go to the directory where Chrome stores your data (on Windows: "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default") and remove the folder "File System". This won't make matters worse: the data in this folder is already corrupted. Removing the directory will allow Chrome to create it again and use it correctly.

yup this is non profit so it won't share any data I believe
-------------------------

Some sites require functionality of things blocked by ad blocker and it's so easy to think a website is broken rather than elements being blocked by adblocker... Particularly, forms and Javascript based buttons.

We can either turn it off or on by default, but when you turn it off, and activate it on a site by site basis, these don't remain blocked. This is a very poor experience, as you battle with ads (eg. the ones that open in new tab) to see content every time you visit the website - of course, it's easy to forget about ad blocker and it is a hassle of loading a site, blocking ads, refreshing the site and remembering not to open any links in a new tab as you'll then have to wait for it to load and add the site to the ad blocker. Until the tab is closed or you leave the website... Then you have to start again.

You use 2x the data doing this. It makes the extension pointless and I have to uninstall it as a result.
-------------------------
data
That's not true. It has this in settings, and I am pasting it here to show you.  If you set ON SPECIFIC sites. it allows you to enter them.

Site access

On specific sites
On all sites

If the folks behind Adblock Plus needed additional funds, why didn't they just appeal to their users or try crowdfunding?  The variety of alternative funding systems available today should give an idealistic company plenty of options other than selling out.

it used to block ads efficiently before. Now the annoying ads keep coming back and eats up my internet data!

It was fantastic for the longest time, but this week it just quit. Needs some much needed encryption updates as well as bug fixes. Switching to adblock for now.

data
Why this extension can access my data on all websites et my tabs and browsing activity ??
-------------------------
data
Just going to copy and paste from their website for you.
Adblock Plus filters are reset on each browser start
Cause: Chrome issue 103018, file storage got corrupted
Solution: Go to the directory where Chrome stores your data (on Windows: "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default") and remove the folder "File System". This won't make matters worse: the data in this folder is already corrupted. Removing the directory will allow Chrome to create it again and use it correctly.

Used for several years, mostly successfully. Had to delete because it was causing ALL pages to take forever to download and other malfunctions. If your computer slows down a bunch, try deleting to see if it's ABP. At first I thought is was my crappy Comcast service, but definitely ABP.

Works wonders for me, YouTube was the reason I decided to get this extension and it works as though YouTube doesn't have any ads. Another great thing I found while on the web was that the sites that usually have those pop-up ads and the ones that show up in the bottom right of the screen are gone. I've had this extension for about a year now and it works all the time and doesn't slow down my computer. I have an AMD ryzen 5 1400 and 16gb of 3200hz ram. Its better than some computers, however its not the best computer. Either way I know for a fact that most computers can run this extension because I had seen a lot of people complaining about that.

Wenn ich ehrlich bin weiß ich nicht was viele haben. Ich mag den Adblocker. Er macht was er soll. Nur leider habe ich mitbekommen dass er auf Twitch.TV und Spotify nicht funktioniert. Stört mich nicht weiter weil ich Spotify Premium hab und bei Twitch ist es nur eine Werbung am Anfang eines Live Streams. Das es Chrome verlangsamen soll oder sehr viel CPU Leistung zieht kann ich auch nicht bestätigen. 5 Sterne auf jeden Fall wert.

Excellent. Works very well. Uses rather a lot of memory, but every time I have to turn it off (because a website forces me to) I hear the CPU fan spin up because of all the extra flashing ads it's loading. Would love if you guys can make it harder for websites to force us to take it off.

Updated review:
It has become far too bloated or ???  Pages take forever to load, the Chrome status bar very frequently shows "Waiting for extension AdBlock Plus"

It's slowed my browser so much I've had to disable it.  I now see more ads, but at least the pages load more quickly.  The goal of blocking ads was to speed the loading of pages and other benefits, but it's going the other way now.  Ghostery takes care of some of it, but think I'm off to find a new ad-blocker to replace ABP.

==========
Previous review:
5*
Just excellent!  I've been using it for quite a while and it works so well.  The only problem I seem to have is sometimes Chrome says it's waiting on the ABP extension in the status bar.  I'm not sure if something else is causing that or if it's the extension itself.

I'm even nice to the sites and allow the non-intrusive ads but will block the ones that detect ad-blockers.  Here's the deal - play nice or I don't play at all.  (OK, so some eventually get blocked by Ghostery anyway... continue reading.)

This extension in combination with Ghostery takes care of just about everything I need.  Sometimes I've found I have to whitelist sites in ABP to get them to work.  I use Ghostery to block the rest, along with trackers, but it usually needs some tweaking to allow some sites/features to work correctly.
-------------------------
speed
100% blockage of ads and no effects on speeds of loading or anything else. Flawless app.
-------------------------

Ridiculous memory leaks and cpu usage. 600 kb when chrome isn't open? Ublock origin or just ublock or even the original adblock are much better.

Really speeds up web page loading on slower internet connections. Easily disabled on various sites when required. 

One of my favorite extensions and usually the first installed when setting up a new browser.

getting more and more higher cpu usage. I think I'll find another ad-blocker
-------------------------
cpu
I have no idea why other people sometimes complain about ABP, except for the CPU usage. But even the Adgaurd extension and uBlock let me down. Someone above said they switched to uBlock Origin and tested it on wowhead.com... well both adguard and ublock failed to block ads on the site, actually when I turned them off the ads were gone. I use adblock plus only know. Little affect on the CPU is a small price to pay for a good adblock, although my AV also blocks some ads & trackers and I have Ghostery which helps too, so it ublock and adguard may have just been incompatible with those add-ons.

Promised ad blocking, but the very next day it instead slows everything down significantly to redirect pages and push it's own ads. When I am on Amazon shopping, for example, it throws adds all over the place to give me comparative prices i do not want, and more importantly, represents a significant invasion of my privacy since it's clearly monitoring everything I am doing in order to target ads.

They should look up the definition of an ad blocker: BLOCK ADS. Who ever heard of ad supporter ad blockers?   

Oh, and contrary to what it says, there is no option to disable the ads, nor is there warning in advance of pushing them. This app needs to be shut down.

See screenshot here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4_9hPPWxAWBZlF1ZDE1eWxqMTA/view?usp=sharing

Adblock Plus is a nice extension for google chrome.But there are some issues with it.The browser will take some time to startup and to load web pages.uBlock is the best alternative for Adblock Plus because it is very light and does not use much of the CPU.
-------------------------
speed
This started out as at least decent for me, I've been able to do things a lot faster and I have a horrific internet connection, so having ads playing on YouTube in like 1080p is not at all ideal... Recently, even after telling the ad NOT to allow "non-intrusive" ads and such, I'm CONSTANTLY getting ads on YouTube. Everywhere. Even ones I tell it to block specifically. Most of them are loud, annoying, and do not adjust quality to my connection speed. 

Unfortunately, I'm stuck using this until I find another one I like.

it misses most ads and you cannot chose to permanently block an ad that it has missed.

Lately it makes Chrome run some pages incredibly slowly.  Google sites like YouTube, Drive, and Gmail are almost unusable at times.  Most other sites are also slowed down but not nearly as bad.

I've tested and it's definitely Adblock Plus causing this.  Temporarily disabling it immediately makes sites load, scroll, and interact at normal speed again.  I only have the Easylist filter selected.

It wasn't like this until maybe a month ago.

Slows Chrome down to a screeching halt.  Removing Adblock Plus was the key to making my browser not just fast but usable.  There are other blockers out there that don't bog down the browser.  I wish I had thought of removing Adblock plus a lot sooner than I did.

My only complaint is kind of a big one.  It has slowed down every page I've visited and Facebook is slowed to a crawl.  This is bad enough that I'm considering changing browsers.

It's an amazing thing to use and it cuts through the annoyingness that slows down my browser when loading pages with big ads on them.

Next step, permanent removal of ABP with a reminder to avoid it forever.

I love this extenuation it does an awesome job at blocking the video ads that kept making my watching of anime slow and choppy.

It's nice for blocking out intrusive ads, but doesn't stop scripted popups or some Flash embeds from playing.  It also slows everything to a crawl on my new computer.  It's actually slightly faster with the extension disabled!

But after a week or so, it almost stopped working also ads powered by AdBlocker appeared, thus slowing down the system, finally had to remove it.

It slows page loads down a lot. Worse, it has suddenly stopped working. I guess Facebook et al. found a workaround. Rrrrrrrrrrrrr.

This is a must for anyone who uses the internet. I've had it ten seconds and my computer already runs better than before. All of these advertisements had been slowing my computer down, but now thanks to Adblock, i don't have to worry about that. Seriously, stop reading this and get Adblock!

Oh it works fine.. but..
To the point where it slows down Chrome to much! The web pages become "Not Responding" and then crash the whole computer starts to become "Not Responding" and then you have to reboot the system.
Don't get me wrong it works great!
But after the umteenth time of Chrome "Sh*ting it self" naa I removed it.. Had to :-(

Works pretty well but really needs to block those annoying useless autoplay videos that are popping up everywhere! Pretty light too but due to the way advertisers work they are constantly finding ways around this! The updates however are pretty rapid when they do get around it!
-------------------------
slow
A must have for any internet users. I recommend it for older internet users as a way to reduce the number of ways they can get a virus, see scams, etc. For me, it has saved me many hours on Youtube, as I already see enough unskippable ads on TV. 

Sometimes I see a few Facebook ads that are partially blocked. You may have to update the subscription lists manually sometimes. (A quick way to get to that is to right click on the stop sign icon and click Options.) That's really the only negative thing I can say about it, and it's a minor one at that.

EDIT: A recent update added a way to block social sharing buttons, which streamlines loading even more for users with a slow connection, and cleans up a little more unnecessary clutter.

It blocks ads perfectly, but at a high price - It can make Chrome frustratingly slow.  If you work with many tabs and suddenly everything starts to crawl, disable adblock to get things moving again.

The extension itself was a very good one, however after using it for about a month; It no longer feels the need to block anything on any site anymore unless I put directly in the filter. For the month it worked it was great, however no it's just an extension slowing down my browser's speed for it's use even tho it's not doing anything it's supposed to.

Adblock Plus is the only way to browse the internet. It speeds up so many sites where the browser would otherwise be waiting to load the ads. Adblock was the last thing keeping Firefox as my main browser until Chrome got it too.

Sorry, but i thinks it works fine. I have NO adds on any site. and it is still much faster than addblock! adblock (that without plus) slows down every webpage i visit. ABP ist still "the same" like adthwart (only the laughing devil i miss :) )

This extension was doing very well in the past and I liked it, but recently it has been a problem with my Chrome (23.0.1271.97 m) on Windows 7 Ultimate: It just eats so much CPU resource and slows the browser to an unbearable extent. My CPU is i5-2410M (dual-core and quad-thread), and most of the times when Chrome is "creeping like a snail" I can see in the task manager of Chrome the current opened tab is using 25% of my CPU, which is exactly an entire thread of it. Just after disabling ABP and leaving everything else as is my Chrome runs as fast as before again! I have been running smoothly on Chrome for about one hour now and it has never slowed again since that. I decided to disable this extension until they fix this issue.

Useful is an understatement. AP has become a dear companion sparing me loads of nonsense ads and upping the loading speed of web pages(a bit..). If a web page doesn't respond well (can't load or similar) I just disable AP or set my own custom filters for that website. Thanx dudes you shine ~d(-_-)b~

Fast and easy; I like having the icon in the address bar for quick access to settings.

However, some ads still slip through, and I wish that the ads that are blocked would collapse (as they do in Firefox).

The best extensions are the ones you don't notice; this is one of them. Other than a nifty little icon for re-enabling ads (almost never needed), the only difference it will make: no more ads. It's that easy. The speed of the browser is not noticeably affected, and everything seems to be perfect - only ad-free.

I've had it for about 3 weeks now, It worked wonders when it was in order. Not sure if its going through an update currently, but its starting to mess up on my browser. The ads that are blocked show a square that says something along the lines of "This ad has been blocked by a third party extension", and it will disappear, and reappear rapidly almost blinking that square over, and over again slowing down my browser. (Hoping it fixes soon)

Where do I start?

Well for starters, just because you can't see ads doesn't mean it's blocked... If anything this should just be called AdViewBlock. Ads still load companies still get the info they want, your info. 

People say "This is super fast and low cpu", thats because its NOT DOING anything, it's just not letting you see an ad that is STILL THERE.

AdBlock on the other hand actually blocks the ads from loading, sure on some sites it takes - seconds to completely block but its a small price to pay for actual ad free browsing compared to this AdBlock Plus nonsense. 

About 1.5-2.3 million of the people who got AdBlock Plus only clicked/downloaded it because they though the guy who made AdBlock made this; this is NOT the case. I really hate how the name is AdBlock Plus as it implies that it is some upgraded version.

AdBlock:
-Different Developer
-Actually blocks ads not just hide them
-Perfect for anyone and shows high cpu usage on few sites and even then the waiting period is short

AdBlock Plus:
-Does NOT block ads only hides them
-Companies still get your information
-Low cpu usage
-Useful for people who just want to not see ads but not block them
-The name is a pitiful lie

I only give this 2 starts instead of one because it may be more useful for people not looking not block ads, just not view them.

That is my report.


Cheers.

Much better than the other 'AdBlock' extension. This one has been around for a very long time, and gets 99% of ads, and who cares about the rare ones that might pop up. The 'AdBlock' version uses a very sluggish method, and cannot display pages  correctly until after it is fully modified. It also increases cpu usage significantly and will drink up netbook batterys like gaterade. This is the best choice for almost every situation. Webpages load FASTER due to less work being done, not slower due to the method the other one uses.

Can you people tell me the actual difference between adblock plus and adblock for chrome in terms of performance
(things like adblocking efficiency, speed etc). I chose adblock plus because I didn't like the donate page with emotional stuffs that comes with adblock. I used adblock for just 2 days. So I can't judge the relative performances. Also I wanted to know if I install both what will happen? Will websites /chrome start crashing? Please answer

It updates the lists just fine, and blocks ads that I need blocked. It's much faster than the other adblock, which I've disabled for now until it picks back up. It'll slow down sites that are media-rich, so be sure to add trusted sites that have unobtrusive ads to your whitelist. For everything else, it'll speed things up.

I don't see the icon in the address bar, nor do I see a 'Block Element' in the right-click menu.

It was doing alright, but after a recent update, the popup to "add" ads is transparent and treats the ad like a window, so I am not able to click "add". My browser slowed significantly, as well as many ads not being blocked.  I switched to regular Adblock until the issues are resolved

It's not perfect, it's best to have a backup adblocker but there's a reason I've kept this one for many years while the backup often changes. This is the toughest most reliable adblocker I've ever had, too tough for some as it can break some websites. It might not always catch all the ads but the manual blocking tool works great and the ads stay blocked. This extention with a supplementary kinder adblocker for those sites that can't take it has made being on the internet so much easier and less annoying

I've been using this extension for at least 5 years, and on it's own it's a must have, as it blocks so much AND allows for manual blocking of html stuff on any given website. But in conjunction with ABP, ads/pop-ups/malware potential are absolutely taken care of.

However, as of writing this, the extension appears to be broken for me on Chrome, where pages refuse to completely load, and I can't access or manage the extension on my toolbar other than disabling it (which fixed the issue completely). I hope this is an issue that not many other users are experiencing, and it gets fixed soon, because this extension is a godsent.

Edit: Just uninstalled it and reinstalled it, if you have this issue, this seems to fix it

A review after years of using it:

It is amazing and works great! But let me elaborate on that.

IF you don't know what you're doing, don't do it. I recommend reading the "manual" on github first, if you intend to highly customize it to your liking.

I did not know how to actually use it, for a veeeery long time... I did not know why ads were getting in, on pages and when watching videos(tv shows). And I added tons of custom filters to it, on top of its built-in filters, to force block them. Now, on top of making my PC very slow because of it, the ads were still popping up. And my PC is an R9 3950X with 32GB of RAM...
Well, in my defence, it's built-in filters were not that great in the beginning.

I was always complaining on github about stuff not working, and ending with the creator scolding me........ And everybody was always telling me to restore it to its default settings, use its built-in filters, and never play with the dynamic filters. I didn't understood why, and never listened, I was stubborn.

But this year finally I read the manual for it, and understood why nothing was working. And duh, it was my fault because I played with the dynamic filters when I didn't even know how exactly they work.
Then I restored it to its default settings and only used its built-in filters. And guess what, everything started working as advertised, with no issues. But to add, the built-in filters are way better than they used to be years ago. And more extension updates I guess.

So if people want to use it, I suggest reading its manual on github first. I promise a lot of confusion and things not working, will go away.

Also, this is not an AdBlocker. It may have some filters for blocking Ads, but it is a more advanced tool for blocking page elements and other stuff.

PS: Sorry @gorhill for being an idiot...

Overall great but I don't like that it blocks Honey by default and it's hard to stop it unless you just turn it off. It gives me the option to add to whitelist, so I choose that and it opens a page with a bunch of code and no other instructions. I figure it's good to go and it's still blocking honey. Would be nice if it made it more clear on how to whitelist chrome addons.

The extension as of the present time, completely stopped working on Google Chrome across all tabs. This appears to be the result of an update gone wrong, with requests being blocked coming up with the number "?". Please fix this ASAP.

Update: This issue I was able to resolve by using Extensity to shut off all my extensions and turn them back on. This issue lasted for many hours even when the browser was closed until I did this.

Update 2: Been a couple years, this extension has worked wonders. The latest update adding a "block element in frame" is welcome and I hope it helps get those particularly hard-to-delete elements blocked. Very impressed with this extension, everything else is a very distant second place.

Update 3: Breaks the Brave browser to the point it cannot load any webpages. Tested and verified this specific extension when turned on and off multiple times was the only culprit, no other extension replicated the issue. That is completely asinine and needs to be fixed. Flat 1 star until resolved.

uBlock Origin is free and open-source, so you know you can trust it. Blocks all YouTube ads, completely removes ads from all websites.

Better than Adblock Plus. ABP is great especially combined with a browser with built in adblocking, but it only goes so far, there are still some ads that can get through them such as ones built into video player clients (no other adblocking method I've tried has been able to stop them besides uBlock Origin). uBlock also blocks other ads too, but I was mostly concerned with trying to get the ads baked into video players to go away.

Quite literally essential when browsing the internet. There are so many intrusive, distracting, obstructive and just annoying ads nowadays, you can't go without a solid adblocker, and this one is the solid-est of them all.

Also works with annoying UI elements on websites that don't contribute to anything and just waste space, like most of the fandom wiki website.

You can even block entire websites from appearing at all! You can even block the little recommendation bar that appears when you pause a youtube video on a third-party website

You merely need to tell uBO that you want it to allow these resources. (They are blocked by default since most Internet users find these features overly privacy-intrusive.)
You can either:
- disable the privacy-related filters on the "3-rd Party Filters" pane (I don't recommend it, but this will fix all the social buttons everywhere): https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters
- whitelist specific resources on specific pages, for that refer to documentation (harder, but in my opinion wort the effort):

Also should mention, every so often an ad will get through somewhere. There is a battle between getting ads to people and the tech that goes into blocking them. So whenever youtube finds a new way to slip the ads past the ad blocker, updates are required to block those ads, and Ublock always comes through within a few days.

It was perfect for years, but over the past year or so more and more functionality has disappeared. Ads are not blocked on Twitch AT ALL. I kept waiting hoping that this would eventually be fixed, but as I said it has been a long time and no changes. Additionally, more and more sites are detecting the app and refusing access to the site until you disable it, which obviously defeats the purpose of having it in the first place.

Best ad and content blocker, the real deal. Even if something slips past once, you can block it manually and it will never appear again.

This extension is a two-sided coin. It is by far the best chrome extension I've used for comprehensively blocking all ads (even popups, chat box nonsense, etc). But it's also the most likely extension I've used (of any extension type) to create problems with functionality. It doesn't play well with many e-commerce sites, banking sites, etc.

You can whitelist the sites, or even specific pages quite easily, by clicking the extension icon when it is over aggressively blocks site elements.. Presto changeo!

NOT happy!!!!!!!!!!! I now no longer can use Google image search as more than half of the images are blocked with colour blocks and any image that shows up is unclickable! And NO it is not malware in my computer, nor is it cache clearing which I have tried and I have tried zapping off the extension for google images, NOTHING works!!!!!!!!!!! I tried disabling, still FAIL!!!!!!! Furious as hell! YOU fix this now or I will be making a formal report against you! I only got this extension installed to get rid of the silly cards that pop up at almost end of youtube videos!!!

I hate to be that guy but this ad blocker isn't really the "Holy Grail of adblockers" that people have been championing for years. Sure it's independant, open-sourced and lightweight, and while that's great and all, uBlock is a bit too extreme when it comes to blocking. For years I had to put up with many websites not functioning properly (e.g. cannot submit form, some UI elements missing), and then I finally realize that it's due to uBlock, so I turn it off and the site functions perfectly.

In the description it says "think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using". Well... I hate to break it to you (and I hate to sound ungrateful), but I believe those people are the reasons why some sites do not function properly. There are probably way too many filters that go off as false positives, which unintentionally block UI elements that were actually important for the site to function. I took a look at those filter lists and it made my head dizzy so I'm probably not going to bother trying to figure out the culprit myself.

Youtube constantly changes how it works. Every single extension/script ends up either having a short period of not working or end up dead due to this. Just have some patience and your problem will get fixed.

PS: For me, even 1 hour after your post, μblock Origin works. I have tested it with the 100 ads in one video, which is 3 hours long and I test my extensions on, since I use a different extension for youtube, to allow ads from my subscribed channels. But μBlock Origin just blocks it all as intended, so it seems to be a problem from your side.

I used it for years but for the past month it just stopped blocking YouTube ads. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it still doesn't work. If it is my own fault I will change to 5 star but until then it will remain 3 star.

Goodbye Ad's!

I run a Pi-Hole system on my network but it didn't block all the ad's all the time, and I noticed recently that IMDB had shifted the ad's to a new format which the Pi wasn't blocking anymore.

So I am using this extension on my school computer, I am unable to turn it off which Im pretty sure is not on accident. It's a good extension, blocks garbage, but there is a HUGE problem.

No matter what I do it always blocks it. I even turn it off. Please allow me to use sites that I want to use.

Ublock origin works for the most part, and up until recently it was borderline flawless. However. over the last few years, it has failed to keep up with various tactics used to circumvent it. Bestbuy, Twitch, various news outlets (even with javascript disabled) just to name a few examples.

As time goes on, more sites find ways to detect Ublock users and disable essential/simple functions (login, watch a stream, etc), and the only option is to disable Ublock when it happens. Workarounds don't get introduced, and as more websites add these tactics it will render Ublock useless except for a niche userbase.

I hate ads. 
I have been using this extension for quite a bit now, without realizing what it was doing. Recently, I had to format my PC, and I was shocked with the amount of ads present in my everyday websites!! YouTube is impossibly irritating, every video now has an ad prior, which I didn't know BECAUSE THIS EXTENSION WORKS!! (Even Gmail has some fake emails to display ads, which I also didn't know, because this blocks even that!)

Definitely recommend

Regular: This extension blocks all ads and gives the user some measure of control and oversight over what's on their computer. I'm nontechnical, but this extension is what got me looking a little into the internet. The problem is as more users get this extension, more focus will be put onto those who don't. I don't know what's going on behind the scenes, but I didn't expect this to last as long as it has.

Dramatic: The one extension that redeems the internet, at least for now.

Something bad happened recently. While this extension can get bloated and heavy on resources, it had  some really good filter lists, those lists now have quasi corrupted the extension breaking a lot of functionality on many sites like on Twitter and many more. Often, it won't block many annoyances and ads like it did before. Furthermore, the option to disable WebRTC actually enables it and it doesn't do anything.You are forced to use another extension to block WebRTC — unbelievable. As a result, I am now solely using Adguard instead.Perhaps one day I might return to Ublock. However, I think this extension is going to become unsupported unless it becomes a paid model.

Fantastic x1000!!! My favorite feature is the element zapper (the lightning bolt after you click the ublock icon in the top right) - this gets rid of banners that follow you through the whole page which blocks a huge chunk of the screen and any other intrusive part of a website.

DYNAMITE! This extension supremely exceeds my expectations. All I expected it to do when I first added it to my web browser was to just block annoying pop-ups but it also blocks my YouTube ads. Not only that, there is also a neat feature called "Block element..."! This may be TMI, but I had an assignment on Google Classroom from a previous semester which I wasn't satisfied with my grade, though my teacher would not let me redo it. Sometimes I would accidentally click on old assignments, and it the grade on that assignment still haunted me every time I saw it, even though it was from the past. I used the "Block element" feature to hide my grade and comments from my teacher on that specific assignment from my view. Bam! I don't have to see any unwanted negativity from the past. This extension is a MUST-HAVE! 😁

After a period of using it I ran into lots of false positives. I wasn't able to receive e-mails and messages on my computer but I could on my phone, and upon uninstalling uBlock I discovered it was because it blocked the scripts responsible for loading content. I've also observed it blocking CloudFlare CDNs, making some essential scripts not load. To leave a review I needed to turn off uBlock as it was blocking the ability to rate the extension.

Sometimes this would just... stop working. Specially after my computer does an update. Don't get me wrong it works, but it takes almost an hour for it to remember "Oh right I'm supposed to block things..."
So video ads get through, ads on other sites, pop-ups... it all gets through. Just sometimes it forgets "Oh right, I should actually start blocking things." like it just woke up and hasn't had it's boot up coffee.
When it works, it's solid! But when it doesn't work, like on boot up... it's why I'm giving it 3 stars.

Bad issue appeared!
In uBlock Origin v1.30.2 when "Prevent WebRTC from leaking local IP addresses" is On - WebRTC exposed my public IP address!

Thus, this uBlock's privace option is working vice versa!

Is there a list to block facebook sponsored ads? They are most of my newsfeed at this point.

Has always done me good, but like many others it has recently stopped working on Twitch. I would not blame this on the devs of uBlock Origin because Twitch just rolled out an update to the ads that has them actually playing through the stream. So, in terms of what the extension "sees" it's not blocking the ad traffic because you would also have to block the stream as well.

It's been a faithful companion on any browser I use for years. Unfortunately, it seemed to stop blocking ads on recipe sites. I know, makes me sound like a boomer, but since I use my chromebook as my recipe book... it's kinda annoying. These recipe sites not only make you scroll through a mountain of crappy dialogue about the recipe before the actual instructions itself, but now I gotta see completely ridiculous ads? Boo!

Other than that, I'll never use any other adblocker. I can't trust a site that asks me to turn it off; between them and Ublock, I"ll chose ublock every time.

Used for years without an issue, then within the last few months it's started failing. When Facebook got its new update, this extension was no longer able to block its ads. I assumed this extension would then just get an update to work with it, but it didn't.

Still works MOST of the time but I wish they'd patch this up.

Was great for years. Then this 'update' appeared at the end of June, and it's been nothing but pain and wasted time ever since. Yes, I've read the "release 1.28.0 notes". No, it does not solve the multitude of problems I now encounter daily across Websites I frequent. In fact, it's now faster and easier to simply turn uBlock completely off.

Addendum: with more experimentation, and starting from scratch (getting rid of YEARS of customized My Filters data), it's a much better experience, mostly due to simply disabling a number of the default Filter Lists that come with uBlock Origin. It seems to be that the combination of "old defaults" and "new block methods" were the crux of the problems I'd experienced. I'm constantly needing to add block rules to my 'new' My Filters & My Rules lists, but at least I don't have to endure what advertising majors call "the modern Web-browsing experience," full of crappy, annoying, MOVING ads, that track us across multitudes of sites.

I can't say whether starting from zero will fix anyone else's issues, but it's certainly worth a try if you've been using uBlock Origin for a very long time, and you've suddenly started having problems with uBlock since late June, making your browsing experience...let's say "irritating."

Always worked great, but predominantly used it to block YouTube ads. Now it does not do that properly. You just get a white screen until the ad timer is done ticking down. Would be great if that were fixed.

Developers please help. This popular site has persistent pop up ads, and it's impossible to stop them using this extension. Open this page then wait for 5 seconds, to see the ads. https://www.y2mate.com/youtube/z_mCnVHsX7Q

Also please help us block "Switch to Chrome ads" on Google, Gmail, and other Google sites when using the new Microsoft Edge Chromium browser.

It's okay, still getting ads on some website and YouTube. Also getting ads in Gmail which is weird, never happened before. Also it blocks a lot of the websites that I visit and don't know how to create an whitelist or exceptions, the extension is not clear on how to accomplish this. Might look for something else that makes it easier to whitelist and create exceptions.
-------------------------
block
This used to be the only ad/tracker blocker I would use. But since they change it so you can no longer Green Light (to allow) a certain website I no longer use it. Sometimes uBlock blocks links that needs to run, and being able to easily change the permission from red to green was very helpful. I REALLY hope they but that feature back. Until then I will be using a different extension.
-------------------------
block
U-Blocker Gave me the option to block any, imean any ad i want and it wont pop up again, also it blocks ads imediatly
-------------------------
block
Recently, this extension decided to remove easy access to greening/allowing rules which makes this extension extremely annoying to use when the filter set used is overeager to block sites. It's terribly user unfriendly. I shouldn't have to hunt through custom settings to restore a feature that should have been there to begin with.
-------------------------

Blocked ads that the Adblock extension couldn't. Looking at you WoWhead.com.

It's explained in the release notes: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/1.28.0

It seems you were misusing dynamic filtering, you should use noop (gray) rules to bypass block rules.

Hear about the feature on tiktok from a content and the person said that it would block all ads on YouTube, it doesn't block the ad at all it keep causing Chrome to crash and i have to reinstall Chrome 100x to get it to work again so I came back to the chrome web store and looked up the extension again. this is what I found out "uBlock Origin is not an "ad blocker", it's a wide-spectrum content blocker with CPU and memory efficiency as a primary feature." so basically it does nothing at all to block any ads on YouTube so this tiktok content person lied to me and a lot of other people sad
-------------------------

I've been using this extension for well over a year now (since I got my current computer) and up until today, it's worked perfectly. HOWEVER, right on this very day as I write this review it suddenly started blocking a bunch of non-ads making me unable to use any site. Everything just appeared as plain text.
Not sure why it started to happen.

It seems youtube implemented a new form of advertisements, although they are still technically getting blocked by this extension since you receive a white screen indicating the source is being blocked, the new ads are built into the player and make you wait a set amount of time until you can skip. this extension needs an update

Pretty good adblocker with room for improvement.  While ublock does have the most stringent ad blocking it's a completely scorched earth product by default.  Unlike the original adblock there's not an easy way to operate in a blacklist mode instead of a whitelist mode (blacklist meaning ads are allowed unless you blacklist the site you are on at which point they are blocked).  .Ideally with one or two clicks it could be changed to a blacklist mode blocker.

The performance is good, and the amount of ads that are blocked is unrivaled.  Good product overall but I prefer the original adblock so I can allow more easily allow sites some ad revenue by default and only block them if their ads are obnoxious.

Fantastic extension, but there is a BUG and a missing feature.
The bug is that the "Block media elements larger than" does not always work on Chrome; this is 100% true.  To help debug or work around an unknown Chrome bug (not present in firefox), it does work in combination with the extension block image, and yes as you guessed it, the perpetrator that wasn't being blocked is images.  The image block chrome extension interestingly does not work by itself, but it does work with ublock when the block media option is used.  I don't like the terminology used.  It could "block" prior to download or after download.  Which is why you either need to rename or implement the feature "Do not download  media elements larger than", and you can use the extension image block to extend it to other media elements.  

  This problem is absent on Firefox.  The missing feature that I want is "

I really like it. But it stopped blocking ads on YouTube. Can you do something about it?
-------------------------

Only gripe with this app is that I have some things on my filter to block them, but whenever it blocks me, it sends me a notification in a new browser, which is basically just sending me an ad to tell me that it has blocked an ad. It totally defeats the purpose.

Unlike other crappy adblockers which are paid off by media corporations, uBlock blocks ALL ADS, and makes it easy for you to add custom filters. It's insane that it's free.

Ublock Origin is preventing any page from opening for me as of about 12 hours ago...  
I've used it for years and it's been great, not sure why it's suddenly causing problems. Hopefully it gets fixed in the future.  
  
EDIT: I fully uninstalled/reinstalled ublock and it's working again, but all my custom ad-block setups are gone which is rather annoying as i'd been adding to them for years.  
It's working again, so it's still the best ad-blockers out. I had to use Adblock Plus for a week while I sorted out my Ublock issue, and it truly is much worse.

THIS IS THE REAL UBLOCK origin. Do not use any OTHER UBLOCK as they have recently been compromised. I almost got burned by craftprimes.com (a malware hotbed) thanks to "ublock pro" which decided I needed to install loads of garbage from that website by injecting JS into every web request I made. Ublock origin prevented this attack from occurring to which I am deeply grateful.

No other ad blocking app works as well as this and none add to its capabilities.  Only it is needed to block ads.  I find other apps necessary to block scripts and handle cookies, but not to block ads.

Would have given it 5 stars, because it does a great job of blocking actual ads, but it goes way overboard and literally disables essential functions of certain websites.

Well I figured out the issue which I couldn't find any information on anywhere. Developer should have mentioned that when creating custom filters for images and Etc. We used to put an Asterisk in front of the url path to shorten it's path and block anything with that image name. Yet now the Asterisk * isn't needed yet it wasn't noted by the Developer.

I downloaded this because it's supposed to help block videos and other things on youtube. It does not work at all for really anything. I haven't seen it block one ad or video. Luckily I still have another ad blocker that nearly gets everything. This is not worth the time or effort to try and get it to work. You need an advance degree in coding to use it anyway, or you have to trust sites that post block coding. Just move on from this and find something better to use.

So used to this app and how well it works that using a machine without it looks bizarre and bloated. Works great "out of the box" but with a few tweaks you'll never see annoyances or ads again. Be sure to know how to whitelist a site if you find its blocking an element you need. Don't leave a negative review because you don't understand or know how to do something, that's on you not uBlock.
***Be sure to use uBlock ORIGIN only not uBlock***

Works same as before, but recent 'problem' is that my usual streaming site, which has harmless link that I can click for new tab to affiliate site, can no longer open new tabs from links.

It's good, it makes it easy to block/unblock sites, and seems to block most ads (though not all). That being said, I might like to see an enhancement regarding possible recommendations/ratings to block or unblock a site. Perhaps the blocker could detect what it blocked in terms of knowing what ad-supply sites in the page have bad reputations. I have it set to block all sites except the ones I manually whitelist. 

Case in point, just a few minutes ago I saw a pleasant message on tomsguide.com asking me to unblock them when I found an interesting article linked in a Google search, and I went ahead and did. I should have clicked "Continue reading with Ad Blocking," however, because I instantly got hit by a compromised ad that replaced the article with a full-screen red page saying my Chrome was infected and call Microsoft at "this number" and a pop-up dialog box, which we all know is one of those fake tech support things. I immediately closed the page. Running MalwareBytes and McAfee scans indicated I'm safe from anything that might have gotten downloaded without admin rights, however. 

So, moral to the story is, keep everything blocked using uBlock Origin unless it keeps a site from loading correctly at all. I acknowledge that "recommendations" could open the extension to problems (fake recommendations, or even ad companies paying to get good recommendations), as I believe led to the downfall of at least one previous popular ad blocker.

One of the very few truly trustworthy pieces of software that, it seems, Google have now effectively blocked from the chrome web store.

I was so sick of mediocre ad blocking extensions, but then I found this one. No, its name and interface aren't as attractive as some of the bigger ones out there, but the point of an effective ad blocker is to do its job in the background. You're supposed to be able to forget it's there while it performs at 100%. And it's supposed to actually block ads instead of just letting some of them slip through.
This does exactly that.
Recommended use: Combine with Anti Adblock Killer.

By blocking simply all ads, the internet will be hurt, and possibly really bad. First of all, small websites really need some revenue from ads to be able to keep existing. Do we want to end up with an internet where only the big websites keep existing? Secondly, big publishers will start to do more and more to prevent ad-blocking from staying legal or to circumvent them all-together. If we enjoy all this free content on the internet, it is more than fair to let big and small websites earn some revenue by displaying Acceptable Ads. This means ads that are not disturbing and have to adhere to strict guidelines. I am switching to Adblock Plus, because they care about a true neutral and free, sustainable web through blocking all annoying ads but accepting small non-disturbing ones.
-------------------------

I love this extension, but it seems to be applying the filters too broadly. I've just been blocked from manually downloading a file without explanation that had "_ad4." in its name. I'm pretty sure blocking should not happen for intentional navigation, at least not silently.

I've used this extension for ages and love it. However, it has completely broken all wikis on Gamepedia.com by blocking all links within the site.

Fix links on gamepedia (and preferably allow any user to create an issue or provide a way for us to contact you) and I'll happily increase the stars to 5.

Only time I ever see ads is when I go to local restaurants and they have the TV on. Otherwise, I haven't seen a single ad since installing this. Plus, if you ever DO manage to see one, you can use the element picker to select the ad, then preview what the page would look like with that domain is like when that element is blocked. Pretty useful for not ONLY ads, but unwanted parts of pages. Example being the "Suggested Friends" popup on Facebook. If I wanted friends I would look for them, not let a site do it for me. Pretty easy to block it. Haven't had suggestions in a while.

Blame the website not the extension, obviously. The websites can detect if you're using an adblock, it's your choice if you still insist to visit the website blocking the images because you're using an adblocker, or just not visit the website at all. This happens even if you use other adblockers out there (like the standard Adblock) so this is not uBlock's fault, blame the website.

I love being able to forget that YouTube has ads. And Spotify's web player.

Notable features: Element zapper (hold shift to keep using it), disable all blocking for the current site with one click (with complimentary reload button nearby), manual site blocking, premade lists for malicious and undesireable site blocking (sites such as ad redirects), easy options to disable said blocking temporarily (a few minutes) or permanently when encountering a blacklisted site.

I haven't used these, but it seems useful to have options to block "all popups," "large media elements" (i.e. autoplaying videos), and JavaScript (I'm afraid to know when you'd need that).
-------------------------
block
By now a lot better than ABP. Takes less time to load and there's practically no site targeting it. What I would love is to have the possibility to block Cookie Agreements as well, they've become more annoying than ads itself. They're everywhere. I don't know whether this is possible or not, but would be a great great feature.

It used to work flawlessly, but now some ads come through here and there.  I tried to use the blocking tools like element zapper mode or right clicking and selecting block element, but these features don't seem to work either.  What happened, and why has this been a problem for so long without a fix?

Edit: I fixed this issue by going into the white-list settings and deleting all entries, and enabling cosmetic filtering.  Will update review if I find any more ads, but this fix seems to have restored the element zapper mode.

Use the Logger for X sites. And when you see an entry like "Popup" for the specific site, click on it, select Block, then click on Create to make a custom filter for that Popup. Also, the uBlock drop-down menu has a button that says "click to block popups on this site", click on it.

Your filter manager is rude. He shares his filter managing with NanoAdBlocker. I found a problem with one of the filters blocking "The White House" on Facebook, on NanoAdBlocker and reported it. Well I was berated and belittled on their GitHub due to not being helpful and posting about politics. I had my comments deleted and threatened to be blocked. So I switched back to UBlockOrigin. It was fine for a day but as of today it is also blocking "The White House" on Facebook. So I reported it on UblockOrigin's GitHub and lo and behold the filter manager posts on there as well and insults my intelligence stating that I am incapable of understanding the complexities of a filter list so I should just refrain from ever posting again. I didn't get a "Thank you for bringing this up, we will look into it and resolve this issue." No instead I got insulted and harassed. Right before I posted this review someone did state in the Ublock Origin Github that the App and the filter list on Ublock Origin were managed by different people that the issue will eventually get resolved. However he didn't state it would get resolved because of my input (I was the first to report it) but instead stated that "it would have gotten resolved eventually".

[ Overview ]   Best product. Blocks ads and unwanted content most of the time most of the time
[ To advertisers ]   If you break through, I close the page and make sure to NOT buy your stuff
[ To devs ] Often I CAN select the only valuable part of the website (actual text) with "block selected". Please add feature "only show selected". Otherwise wide empty margins (for killed ads) show up.
Also, please add features "toggle/remove user filter for this page".

I just want to say to the devs. You are like gods. The gods haveth bestowed a blocker that kills everything. ABP doesn't even compare! This isn't an adblocker as sites don't see it as one. It's a "U" blocker as in i block all "U" ads.

Problem is the response to blocking. A] many sites starting to recognize blockers and now refuse to display content, B] I've seen some sites cause uBlock to show 80 even 100 blocks. So, I'm beginning to think the days are numbered for ad blocking via conventional transports. Although ads provide revenues for content, nobody sees how viewers dislike the current situation. Losing net nuetrality is their first volley. I expect Chromebooks and Android will begin to force ads before launching apps, bypassing our tools altogether. Then your only response will either put up or shut off.

Can't block all ads, but it blocks most of them. Recommended for older operating systems or PCs that really don't need the slowdown caused by lots of ads.

It appears the adblockers have gotten into the politics game by blocking certain pages not liked by one particular side of the spectrum.  uBlock appears to be involved as well now, very sad when adblockers are limiting the 1st Amendment. Rather questionable I must add.

You really can't go wrong with this. Low resource usage, effective ad-blocking, and a little bit of security on top of it all, blocking dangerous popups from running on your browser. They offer an easy-access method of allowing certain ads as well, to support sources that you believe deserve them. Overall, just easy to use, effective, and very minimal in it's footprint for being so effective. It beats out every competitor, in every way.

Unfortunately, it didn't work for eliminating the "Ad Blocker Detected" messages.  :-(

Updated:  I actually was using that.  But I need to uninstall it anyway.  Someone else has mentioned a CAPTCHA issue and I had trouble with that, too.  After clearing cookies/cache to install it, I couldn't get logged back in to most of my sites.  Will try again after that issue is resolved, as I like that it's less resource intensive.

After having this ad blocker on for a number of months, I've decided to delete it. I actually find that it blocks too much stuff. As a result, web pages often don't display properly. This means I have to turn it off for the site, making all the ads populate the page. It also has a tendency to block me from accessing pages when I click on ads from my email, the only ads I actually want to interact with. Sure, I can continue on to the page by overriding it, but sometimes that takes a number of clicks. I feel like this blocker gets in the way more than it helps, compared to other options. I will say that the one time I watched Hulu in my browser, I liked that it blocked their ads. But I very rarely use a computer for that service, so it just doesn't fit my needs.
-------------------------

Filters are powerful tools. The default ones should be ok for most people, and if it blocks stuff on a website where you don't want it to block anything, you can just whitelist the site.

Ah, uBlock Origin. That little icon sits in the top corner, never getting looked at.

uBlock is an amazing blocker that'll block just about everything you come across. Pair it with uMatrix, and you'll be protected against scripts as well.

Keep in mind, uBlock lost support for blocking YouTube ads a while back, so you will need to pick up a separate YouTube ad blocker on the Chrome Web Store.

Runs marvelously! Came from using adblock plus as it basically allowed many ads that should have been blocked since the dev's grey area of "acceptable ads" was getting wider and wider by the second. To each his own and there's no shame in making money and I'll just exercise my freedom to go with Ublock Origin. Also, Ublock is WAY WAY lighter on memory than adblock plus which was one the two major reasons I switched, great work!

This extension blocks nearly all ads and speeds browsing up tremendously on my old computer.  It also disables anti-adblock on many pages.

However, it misses some pop-ups; install Poper blocker for that.
-------------------------

It's better than nothing  now that ABP is going to add ads of their choosing for a revenue source. I only moved back to ABP because it  handled pop-ups better,  the element blocker seemed to be much better. 

Here if I set an element to be blocked with wildcards(*), it is only for the session. If I come back or refresh the page, those elements get reloaded.

I wish they would block Facebook ads like Fluffybuster Purity does but FBP can slow down how any website can load because it reads your feeds much like how uBlock works and filters content. 

I can use the element blocker to hide a specific ad, but on page reload, the ad is back. So it's kinda pointless. 

That is where ABP shines. Elements blocked stay blocked regardless of how many times the page is reloaded, but where they pale is their ability to intercept pop-ups and pop-unders.

Blocks some, but far from all ads. Still see banners, video ads and other annoying bs.

If ads come through, you simply should enable more filters.
uBO does not choose by itself what to block and what should be allowed, instead this is prescribed by filter lists. By default, uBO uses only the minimum number of filters beneficial to the most people and allows user to choose for themselves.
You can enable more filters on the "3-rd Party Filters" pane: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters

Confusing and unintuitive interface.  Just a bare interface that indicates that some things on the page were blocked.  No means (or if there is, it definitely isn't obvious) of allowing some things but not others.  So basically the only thing you can do is leave it on, shut the whole thing off when it gets in the way, then turn it back on when you're done.  No middle ground.

I gave it a college try because Steve Gibson endorses it.  Now that I've used it for a while, I have no idea why he does.  Others that he's endorsed in the past are much better and easier to use.

Uninstalled.

It really does cost less in performance compared to other adblockers. Works on everything so far, whitelist options available. More sites detect this extension now so, where as before I was able to use 100% of whatever sites features I was surfing. Not a problem tho, still blocks, at a lot less hardware performance.

Thank You very very much!
Relevant Popups are rarely blocked per default and this can be customized via settings.

All the other stuff is gone!
e.g. my mailbox provider injects a lot of ads directly into the web ui for accessing my mailboxes. BUT: I'm using NO a free service - I'm paying for that...
And now: using uBlock and all is fine :)

works well enough, especially the element picker. However i don't care enough to do more than use the element picker, so that can cause problems if you say block a trailer video banner thing at the top of Netflix then it goes a little wonky when you actually try to watch a video on Netflix. Now there is some way to change filters, but that is not  immediately obvious as to how to do it from the right click menu.

It started out to be a great ad blocker, but then it started blocking too many legitimate pieces of code. Especially on e-commerce websites where it might block certain javascript code blocks which cause pieces of the pages to act unexpectedly or not work at all due to missing javascript and swallowed script errors. I removed this and will just deal with ads instead.
-------------------------

This extension like every other adblocker I've come across only blocks, and is only capable of blocking, what you tell it to. If it's blocking too much for your liking then simply subscribe to less filter lists. You could also disable "generic cosmetic filtering" which you should notice making a real difference alone but again, at the end of the day, it's only blocking (or allowing) what you and every other user instructs it to. I would suggest taking a few hours out of an evening reading up on how to write filters to block ads dynamically, statically, and more relevant to your issue how to add exceptions (whitelisting). It's really not that difficult but the onus is on you to tell whatever blocker you use what to allow and what to block. You could even unsubscribe from every list meaning it won't block anything and use the new "zapper" feature which will block whatever elements you click on a page without creating any permanent rules but if you subscribe only to the filter lists you know you want and unsubscribe from the others, and disable generic cosmetic filtering (should be already done by default) you'll be good to go.

Also, what kind of malware did it clean up? It is a network filter that merely blocks bad network requests, it can not uninstall another extension or even something on your system. If you did have adware (malware displaying ads) it might have blocked the requests, but the software is still on your system. I'd recommend fixing it manually.

What is the problematic site?

This is a problem with the filters you use. How to fix:
1. Go to the website with this problem;
2. click on uBO icon -> menu will appear, click on little list icon on the right of a pipette. That will open the logger in a new tab.
3. Click on the original tab and go through the website till you know an image was blocked.
4. In the logger red means  blocked, find URL that looks like it corresponds to that image. Click on the rule to see in which list the erroneous rule appears, disable (un-check) that rule on this tab and click "apply":

The good
• I love it. It is owned and supported by a friendly community. Not a corporation. More secure because its code is publicly available for review and contributions on GitHub at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
• Easy to use. With both basic or advanced modes.
• Lightweight on memory and CPU resources
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome
• Clear Manifesto:
......• The user decides what web content is acceptable or not in their browser.
......• The uBlock project does not support Adblock Plus' "Acceptable Ads Manifesto", because the "Acceptable Ads" marketing campaign is really the business plan of a for-profit entity.
......• Users are best placed to know what is or is not acceptable to them. uBlock's sole purpose is to give users the means to enforce their own choices.
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome.
• Lots of features
• uBlock Origin has a better track record at fully protecting your privacy, than AdBlock Plus (ABP). There is a controversy around ABP and its related for profit corporation trying to monetize ABP via ad whitelisting. Which means that corporation sales your privacy for profit :( Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adblock_Plus#Controversy_over_ad_filtering_and_ad_whitelisting

The bad
• Confusion with the names. Between "uBlock Origin" and "uBlock". For those not familiar with those names, uBlock Origin is better than uBlock. Mostly because as of May 2017 Ublock Origin is still actively maintained and updated. Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin#uBlock_.28ublock.org.29uBlock Compare to uBlock which as not been maintained and updated for more than 2 years, since 2015, and is trying to monetize an open source project.

In case issue persists:

This is not uBlock issue, it is filter list issue. I had been watching YouTube for a while today and saw no ads. You can either:
 - enable more filters. I opened tab YouTube and played a video (no ads appeared) and looked at the logger. All requests are blocked either "Dan Pollock’s hosts file", "Peter Lowe’s Ad and tracking server list", or "Easy Privacy". Try enabling them.
 - If previous step did not help, you could try creating a new rule (by looking at request logs either in Developer Tools or uBlock one).
 - If first step did not help and you were confused by/skipped the second step, just wait. Someone else will update the list soon.

Unfortunately we live in a time where the internet is plagued by hostile and malicious advertising agencies to the point where even legitimate websites are having their ad-space invaded by these vile cockroaches.

uBlock Origin is the best on the market for what it does.

If you aren't using this, walk away from your PC...

I don't mind seeing an ad here or there but after a few months the ads became incredibly invasive and obstructive. (obviously the point of me downloading adblock was to you know... block ads...) Becoming more and more frustrated I decided to try out uBlock. It is what adblock was and should have remained being. No ads, no fluff, no annoying popups or surveys or flashing lights on the side of your articles now. Say goodbye to the 3 minute ad you have to watch before viewing a 18 second clip on youtube.

Throws an error in the console on some svgs and gifs on various sites, but specifically the site I do development for so every time the page loads there's an error in the console. 

Line 90 of contentscript.js of uBlock:
"if ( typeof vAPI !== 'object' ) {
    throw new Error('uBlock Origin: aborting content scripts for ' + window.location);
}"

Tried everything to prevent the error from being thrown -- even if uBlock is turned off for the site and the site is white listed it still 
throws the error.

Pretty trivial but annoying enough for me to switch back to ABP.

Would be a five if they did something about it blocking disqus.com.
-------------------------
block
Just (1) figure out which list blocks it (via the logger) and disable that list or (2) white-list it yourself.
-------------------------
block
I really like this extension, I use it along with uMatrix for safe browsing. 
 
A few additional features would earn it 5 stars from me. 

* White list a YouTube channel (I understand this isn't easy to do). 

* The buttons at the bottom to block Fonts, Cosmetic filtering, etc are a bit confusing, they're set up weird and it bugs me. So if I want to just block all that junk on a site, instead of them all having an "X" through the icon, they're instead inconsistent. Like, blocking Fonts has an X through it, but cosmetic filtering doesn't, and as for the other 2, I have no idea if they're turned on or not without testing it or looking through the options.  

I understand why its set up like that, I get it. But I just think it's a slightly bad design choice for those 4 buttons. 

Minor grumbles really. 

Best Ad blocker I've used so far.
-------------------------
block
I used to love UBlock Origin. But lately it hasn't been able to block a single ad.
-------------------------
block
Blocked ads as well as AdBlock Plus, but completely used up my entire CPU even after all pages have fully loaded.

Way too much CPU usage on computer... back to AdBlock
-------------------------
block
Better than AdBlock and other alternatives. This is the only one that blocks sneaky ads with auto generated id-s and other stuff. It seems that they do not take money for whitelisting ads which is great.
-------------------------
block
good job,
data text base64 ads has been blocked
-------------------------
block
Its satisfying to block ads & prevent revenue from helping click bait sites & sites with talentless pseudo journalists like gizmodo.
-------------------------
block
THE BEST option for ad blocking ever! I've tried them all folks...nothing beats this, especially the built-in sync feature. Something that is lacking in every other Chrome ad blocker!
-------------------------
block
UBlock Origin is currently the best overall set-it-and-forget-it ad blocker/general-purpose blocker browser extension with the lowest RAM and CPU usage in my opinion, and it is the only one that I have used so far that can block most annoying pop-up ads.

Keep up the good work,

Blocks many ads and even blocks some ads that may be harmful. A great extension for Chrome for the ad-haters out there.
-------------------------
block
is gud, it blocks
-------------------------
block
It blocks most things for me, which is all I can really ask. Some ads are being updated to work around ublock and adblock unfortunately.
-------------------------
block
Just a request for the dev. This ad blocker is not working well with vipbox - a streaming website. There are still way too many ads and popups on that site. In the past, this extension was working well on vipbox but now all the ads and popups are coming up again. These streaming websites are infested with all sorts of malicious ads and popups and a working ad block would be really helpful. Thanks.
-------------------------
block
Does its job, was a bit annoying at first cause it blocked some things that I didn't want but with a bit of hassle you can get it working fine.
-------------------------
block
Worked really well at first and it still blocks ads but recently it has been making youtube videos take a long time to load because it is trying to block the ads.
-------------------------
detect
KissAnime/adfly and other things is detecting this adblock now back then it doesnt please fix it i'd rate 5 stars if you do.
-------------------------
detect
There is nothing to fix. You don't have your settings set up properly. And you don't have the kissanime/adfly detection setting enabled.
-------------------------
block
Probably facebook bought the dev too as they did with adblock, no longer blocking facebook suggested posts as of yesterday..
-------------------------
block
Worked great at first but it appears that Facebook "suggested ads" are not being blocked anymore. Too bad because this was the only ad blocking software that actually blocked them. Still better than anything else I've used.
-------------------------
block
It's like Adblock but actually blocks ads.
-------------------------
block
This is easily the best ad blocker I have ever used.  I had trouble with Adblock and Adblock Plus getting it to block Zergnet ads (Outbrain/Taboola like) which apparently are acceptable ads. Not for me, i wont be forced to load click bait in areas of a page where I want to scroll. uBlock eliminated these ads and unblocking useful elements on a page was as easy as clicking next to the url and making the line green.
-------------------------
block
I have no idea what this does. The description says it's a "blocker" that uses "filters". What does it block? What does it filter? Basic facts about this extension are not mentioned anywhere.
-------------------------
block
This blocks certain ads. Like, if you go on sites that are riddled with ads everywhere, you're not gonna get those pop ups that ruin your life and spam your email account. But things like Twitch and Youtube? Have to deal with that. 
-------------------------
prevent
Didn't work.
I was told that this would prevent sites from knowing I had an ad blocker active. Not only did it not do that, but web sites couldn't even tell when I did white list their site.

Useless.
-------------------------
block
Can even block those annoying wikipedia donation requests and yahoo popups if you use the element picker tool. Of course, blocks Youtube ads as well.
-------------------------
block
blocks nothing on rarbg.to and seems to particularly be allowing certain porn and malware adverts to get through no matter what, wonder why...
-------------------------

Add adblock plus, and most advertisements Gone, Speeds up Firefox since your not dloading stupid adware caches...if it blocks websights you trust, whitelist them...

Doesn't block much adds that is not US based
-------------------------

it is blocking everything & crashlot of time even i have i7 pc with 8gb of ram :(
-------------------------

It simply blocks more of the ads I encounter than popular competitors I've used.
-------------------------
block
Was working great but as of today it is not letting me block anything whatsoever.
-------------------------
block
Been using for 4 months now and only recently has it not been able to block twitch ads
-------------------------
block
I started using this one after I found a random YouTube video on how to block annoying  pink hair girl on a site which ad blocker is frowned upon I got this and now it never happended again(Well I did have to add a filter to it),ad block sell out and, it not blocking add when I turn the program off, forced me to get this. Also my computer feels faster with uBlock Origins
-------------------------
block
What other application do you recommend? I can't find another ad blocker to block as many ads as Ublock does. Also can't find one with an element picker like uBlock has either. 
-------------------------
block
Works well to block ads while not slowing down browsing.
-------------------------
block
Less and less stuff blocked. Also I have to manually update the filters or they stay old.
-------------------------
block
Блокирует рекламу больше чем add block. Я довольна. Спасибо разработчикам ))

prevent
Used the addon for the longest time and it worked great.

However, recently it has been preventing pages from loading at all. Makes me think it is my internet, but when I disable Ublock, it starts working..... This happens on ALL my PCs now, with this addon.

Not sure what happened, but it isn't what it used to be.
-------------------------
block
uBlock Origin is incredibly effective at blocking ads. The most effective I have tried.

Unfortunately it is too aggressive with default settings.  It blocks  everything and will prevent many web services (like gmail) from working properly - and you won't quite know why unless you are cognisant of uBlock running in the background.

Ghostery is better at blocking ads without breaking services.
-------------------------
block
After Adblock began allowing "acceptable ads" and basically turning into the very thing they started off to prevent, Ublock Origin became an instant favorite. Blocked effectively everything that Adblock either failed to catch or simply allowed.
-------------------------
block
The latest update is blocking random pages, even when whitelisted
-------------------------
block
it's blocking random pages. i open them again and it works, but still it's VERY annoying
-------------------------
block
have you updated your list of blocked sites? 
-------------------------
block
FINALLY! I was constantly being tormented by mgid.com ads (sponsored content, fraught with malware and new tab ads). This is the first blocker that is able to filter their connections.

I literally love you.

[EDIT]
I did some testing to see to what extent it could block things, it also manages to close the connection of my nemesis: The invisible "click here and a new tab opens up telling you to trade binary options" ad.

HOW DO I PAY YOU FOR THIS
-------------------------
block
BLAGH! Why would I want to BLOCK a site I was clearly interested in!?
-------------------------
block
This thing was garbage and no one should download it because all it does is block videos that it does not consider "appropriate" but yet it blocked an Education Help video
-------------------------
block
Taking over from Adblock Plus as the torchbearer in making the web somewhat saner.

It could be slightly better at allowing me to pick a background image to block.
-------------------------
block
I've been using ABP for 1 year now, no problems until tonight. I click a video, ublock starts blocking like 50 ads that ABP tries to put back on. Like jesus ABP wtf is wrong with you.
-------------------------
block
Switched from ABP (adblock plus) to this wonderful new ad blocker. Why did I switch? I didn't have an issue with the "acceptable ads" program (where ads in a certain size range and unobtrusive behavior were allowed) - it was because the element picker was half functional. The element picker lets you block completely the additional stuff websites have. On many risky sites, ABP's element picker simply did not work. It refused to work on certain sites that made a large income off visitors. Then it was a cpu hog and I got tired of it (because google chrome is very heavy on my cpu as well). 

UBlock origin's element picker has no restrictions at all. Works on every site I've come across. And tested it side by side with ABP. It's smaller cpu usage is a nice bonus too. I'm praying these folks don't sell out either!
-------------------------
block
Adblock+ was no longer effective in blocking ad.

Did search via google and uBlock Origin was very effective in blocking ads with minimal tweaking (if any) from user.  

I installed on my iMac desktop and immediately ads that Adblock+ allowed went poof!
-------------------------
block
By default it blocks tracking and other things that is needed for websites to work, and many times I have to disable it to have website work.  That even included opening the payment page for my utility (electric) company.  The default should be blocking Ads only, while giving the user the option to block other items if they chose to.  Its default to blocking everything breaks many websites, and is terrible since I continuously have to disable it for websites that I need to use in order to use them.
-------------------------
block
This app blocks a lot of useful functionalities of many site. After installing uBlock a lot of sites will have very strange errors. One example was Youtube stopped remembering where I left off on videos. So when I resumed to a video at a later time, it no longer played from where I last left off.

It also makes many other sites unusable.
-------------------------
block
Easy on the memory and blocks all adds. Lightweight extension.
-------------------------
block
Ironically this extension to block ads now serves me ads via the extensions. DO NOT USE THIS ANYMORE.
-------------------------
block
excellent blocks everything in its range 

and ill tell you why

memory efficient low consumption rate
-------------------------
block
Tried this because ADBlock wasn't doing a very good job. This has blocked everything ADBlock wouldn't even with the acceptable ads option turned off.
-------------------------
block
The best adblocker by far. Lightweight and blocks all ads (not sellout like Adblock Plus which shows acceptable ads). Plus you can whitelist any site very easily. However best thing is the speed, it's consumes very little memory. Good job developers!
-------------------------
block
Adblock was no longer blocking some ads on this website i visit frequently and none of my usual fixes/tricks were working.

Googled my issue and reddit told me to install ublock so here i am. works right off the bat without doing anything. the 2 ads on that page are gone and so is adblock
-------------------------
protect
Protects against malicious .JS attacks in default mode.
-------------------------
block
This is the best adblocker i have tried so far, it seems to be blocking all ads and its light on system usage and a bonus is it blocks some ad urls as well! definitely recommend getting this over any adblockers out there
-------------------------
block
Are the new ads on youtube unblockable? Because I can't seem to block the ones on vevo
-------------------------
block
Perfect, Install and press the power button and Ads are blocked just like that.
-------------------------
block
I went onto the most-ad-of-all-time website and Ublock blocked them all. That's nice because it makes my computer run super fast compared to if there were ads
-------------------------
block
Been using this for around a year, mainly to block Twitch ads.

However, as it's now failing to block those ads I'll be looking for another alternative.

Disappointing.
-------------------------
block
I wish it were easier to pick out elements that you DO want allowed, for example navigation buttons on certain sites are blocked when they're perfectly innocent, otherwise this is a great extension.
-------------------------
block
uBlock Origin is blocking actual content on websites I visit. Is this being fixed or should everyone be uninstalling this now?
-------------------------
block
This much much much better than ABP that has recently started selling ads. It blocks most of the ads and the desired page loads a lot faster without the adblocker
-------------------------
block
blocks ads!
-------------------------
block
I was able to whitelist specific youtube channels easily.  All I did was go the the channels home page on youtube and take that URL and copy and paste that in its entirety to the whitelist box in the settings.  Then click apply and that's it.  I went back to youtube and that channel was now not blocked  but the rest of youtube outside of the channel was having ads blocked etc.  Does that not work for you?
-------------------------
block
I got this because I like ABP however I don't appreciate the creators extorting advertiser for money. ABP was designed to block ads so we would be saved by the hundreds of singles in our area that wants to meet. However the creators got greedy and are extorting advertisers into giving them money and passing their ads off as "Acceptable ads" I realize that there is an option to turn that  off but I don't support a company or want anything to do with a company that does that.
-------------------------
block
Great adblocker, blocks all annoying ads however only reason did not give 5 stars was becasue recently it sometimes disables itself or doesnt work properly where it says the page couldnt be reloaded. if fixed would definetely give 5 stars. easily fixed be re adding to chrome but kinda annoying
-------------------------
block
block all
-------------------------
block
I wish you could add overlay blocking, as many sites have started with this bullshit.

EDIT: Downgraded it because Google Ads are coming through.
-------------------------
block
It's OVER blocking stuff, and even when giving permissions, the pages that I want whitelisted do not load correctly unless I disable uBlock. Particularly my infusionsoft accounts which are my affiliate accounts that I MUST have working properly.
-------------------------
block
"uBlock is interfering with our income"
What exactly do you think blocking people's paid adspace does? =_=
-------------------------
block
The author of uBlock Origin can't take anything "OUT of malware domains" (and in 99% of cases is not inclined to look in list-related issues)
Report to the people which make the list which  blocks "infusionsoft"
(and what is infusionsoft I don't know and don't need to know)
-------------------------

Block YouTube ads, scrubs!
-------------------------

This is probably the best. But still some ads and pop-ups that are not being blocked properly.
-------------------------
block
Best !
I have used all ad blockers and even some paid ones but  one thing it is best at is low on system resources and best on blocking ads.
Thank you for this app.
-------------------------
block
tried many on cpu and memory consumption and amout of ads blocked this came out tops. and many other websites recommend this one
-------------------------

I dont which extention but sometimes chrome opens a new tab with ads on it, ublock block those ads but its very irritating when I'm working . any help ?
-------------------------
block
Ad Block Plus was failing me lately, and I saw this suggested on reddit, thank you!
-------------------------
block
Best out there, but help feels like a developer with no people skills.  The best walkthroughs are NOT by the developer.

  Left is global, Right is per current site.  Green/Red is allow/deny and Gray is allow unless explicitly denied from a filter(rule).... like allow unless my adblock list blocks something from a */advertisement/* type filter. 

uMatrix is the super-advanced version, with even worse documentation... not worth the extra effort, but uBlock rocks.  Make sure you use the Origin version.

The only one that I found that prevents pernicious add pages from opening instead of the links that I wanted to follow!

better and blocks more than ads, also scripts etc
-------------------------
block
I LOVED uBlock and it all of a sudden stopped working.  My browser is up to date. If i press the uBlock Origin logo on my chrome menu bar nothing happens.  It used to open a menu that showed me options about what ads were being blocked etc but now it's not working at all. I'm upset because I was much happier with this extension than my previsou adblocker but it is giving me zero functionality now.
-------------------------
block
I have the exact same problem with ABP. No longer blocks ads. Can't open the options menu. When I uninstall and reinstall it works for a few days but then breaks again. Was coming to get uBlock to solve the problem. Guess it's an issue with Chrome and not with ABP/uBlock.
-------------------------
block
The best blocker ever i have found till now. Never allows even pop-us or any site that that is not trustworthy and the best of all is it provides the option that allows the user to decide what they like and function accordingly. NOTHING CAN COMPARE UBLOCK ORIGIN IN BLOCKING ADS. My favorite is it asks my permission to let the site be on temporarily or permanent for pop-ups. no java script ads or popups also. in short IMPECCABLE
-------------------------
block
The only popup blocker that I've tried that actually blocks popups. Thank you!
-------------------------
block
Slim down all the crap your browser is told to download by the sites you're visiting. Great for users more comfortable tweaking settings as well as those who just want a cleaner surfing experience. 

For those in the latter category: be prepared for more interaction with your browser as you may find videos, images, comment sections, etc., not loading like you're accustomed to. 

Once you learn the ad block way, you can never go back. 

Want to support sites by allowing ads? Whitelist them.
-------------------------
block
It actually blocked most of the ads and popups. What happened recently though is that a malware software detected some very fishy items and they were linked to this extension and of course it was removed by the software. Not sure if I want to trust it again.
-------------------------
block
I loved the light weight ad blocker, but lately all sorts of ads have been getting through. Switched back to adblock plus and all the ads went away again. Would switch back to ublock if they catch up on blocking stuff!
-------------------------
block
It blocks all the ads on my computer.  AdBlock Plus is the one who sold out and not ALLOWS "Unobtrusive Ads" even if you have the box unchecked.  Are you sure you're not a rep from AdBlock Plus trying to lure users back?  I never get any ads at all with Ublock Origin.
-------------------------
block
This page can detect ad blocking...  
http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/14063-natures-way-the-right-c-with-riboperine/

They are detecting that I have Ad Blocking turned on.  I have Anti-Adblock Killer checked, but they can still tell I have it on. and can detect it. 
-------------------------
block
Its Light Weight and Can Block Approx. all Ads.
Thanks
-------------------------
block
it has been going very well and is better than any other ad blocker but recently, some ads that originally can be blocked by this extension didn't get blocked.
-------------------------
block
Adguard adblocker; Blocked 245 537

ABP; Blocked 169,164

uBlock Origin; Blocked 680,374.

Enough said.
-------------------------
block
After trying adblocker and adblocker plus etc. I can tell you this one blows the rest out of the water. Literally blocks everything. While adblocker let an ad through once in awhile. I would highly recommend this to everyone.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block ads, still keep showing up on my browser. Pathetic.
-------------------------
block
Great blocks everything while still being able to view sites
-------------------------
block
this is just great! i pirate games and the sites have popups every time you click but with ublock origin, you can completely block them out. i've never seen an ad block this good
-------------------------
block
Blocks websites from loading non ad content and still shows ads on certain websites. There's also no easy way to disable, you have to go through your extensions tab instead of having a simple button on the toolbar like abp has.
-------------------------
block
Block Google Tag Manager, which is stupid as it stops EVERYTHING on a website from working
-------------------------
block
Your Google profile says: "eCommerce Technology Executive". Is it the real reason you think blocking Google Tag Manager ("BTM") is bad?

In any case, you are wrong, blocking GTM does not "stop EVERYTHING" from working in uBO, because uBO uses a replacement, neutered script which replace the GTM API with functions which do nothing. Things would break only if it blocked GTM without replacing it with a dummy API.

Ghostery does the same thing if I am not mistaken.
-------------------------
block
I installed it because I was told it was better than Adblock Plus, but it is overzealous and often blocks vital functionality on legitimate websites or entire legitimate websites themselves.
-------------------------
block
It's too aggressive. I saw popup about site being blocked because of ads many times, and it was always false alarm.
Sometimes it blocked things like google analytics, which I noticed because I'm a developer, not sure if this is intended, but that's certainly not an ad.
The most amusing case was when it blocked a translation on Google translate....... (the word vulnerable)

Unusable.
-------------------------
block
@Remy Nimja, blocking analytics tracking is not the same as blocking access to the Google Analytics console.
-------------------------
block
Ever since switching to this ad block I've been so much happier browsing the web.
-------------------------
block
This is a great ad blocking extension that is effective and very light on resources.

But one long standing gripe remains is that the Element Hiding function is very poor.

If for example you block a page element and that same element is shown again in multiple locations on the webpage or domain.

This really needs to be able to block all similar items or block parent items across similar pages or entire domains.

There has been many complaints about its deficiencies.

The developer needs to  realise there are issues with uBlock Origin that really do need prompt attention.

Please try and listen to constructive comments made and improve future development of uBlock Origin.

This good extension could be even better than it is now.

When this has much improved Element HIding I will revise my review and I'll only be too happy to give it a 5 star rating.
-------------------------
prevent
This app has worked great to prevent ads from popping up since I have been using it.  You can select an ad that does pop up and prevent it from happening again.
-------------------------

Love being able to block entire elements like sidebars filled with advertisements. This is also much less memory intensive than Adblock or Adblock Plus.
-------------------------

Blocks taboola ads! Thank you. They are the worst ads out there - but allowed in adblock plus...
-------------------------

Worked for about a week then nothing. 

If anyone knows of a "site blocker" that actually keeps a site from opening, as opposed to opening a tab to tell me the site has been blocked, please let me know.
-------------------------
block
If you mean Disqus and related comment APIs, then just whitelist them? If not sure then just keep an eye on the log as it blocks a site. Or run diff between two logs, one blocking and one not blocking. Then whitelist the culprit. 
-------------------------
block
I bet that this can even survive Youtube Red(TM). AdBlock (Ad friendly, Ebola Edition) won't see the light of day after Redtu... I mean Youtube Red.
Edit: So yeah, this survived YouTube Red (I guess they didn't block people yet). Anyway, this is the only adblock that hasn't sold out to AD+'s monopolistic intentions ("acceptable ads" yeah like viruses are "acceptable" as well right?), and runs superior to that extension.
-------------------------
block
Definitely, I wrote this back before I even discovered the advanced dynamic filtering, which allows me to have on-the-fly customization of how web-content is blocked. (Eg: If a certain list/global rule blocks some element/web-script you need, then set a local rule to white list it for that particular website.) Nice how they added protocol blocking as well.
-------------------------
block
Ethics aside, this isn't an "ad blocker" but a comprehensive "content blocker" (gorhill's words, not mine. See his GitHub repo.) It can do a whole lot more than block ads.
-------------------------
bypass
This has worked for me flawlessly for a long time, but since yesterday twitch has been able to bypass it and play ads when I connect to streams. Might be time for an update because it seems they have figured something out.
-------------------------
block
blocks everything on my laptop:)
-------------------------
block
@John Snow, it blocked the sidebar that allowed me to use chat on facebook.com.  Quite a few times, I've gone to sites I love, only to have the extension initially deny me access, because it has to pass through a redirect link to get there.  It's not too hard to change settings, but it's a bit annoying.
-------------------------
block
It slows down video streaming on some sites, I suspect by blocking some streaming sources.

The "block and redirect" filter breaks the payment portion of Humble Bundle.

It's not the extension's fault, but some of the default filters are overzealous.
-------------------------
block
It is not working well  for me:
- doesn't block all the ads 
- on some page it blocks some resources that are required and the sites works in unexpected way
( for example couchsurfing.org )
-------------------------
block
Original "AdBlock" wasnt blocking google ads on search engine and this uBlock Origin just blocked.
-------------------------
block
This addin give you more than just an add blocker - advanced users can control / block many aspects of the browser interaction.
-------------------------
block
Why are people endorsing this product when it is not working worth a crap?
I get aorund 12-18% blocking on average,that is not nearly acceptable.Also there is no easy use guide for this either,it just seems like a bad choice from other options such as Ghostery or Adblock.

I would say this uses less memory because it also does less,so that is not exactly the trade off one wants to see.
-------------------------
block
By the way, how would you know "12-18% blocking on average" is "not nearly acceptable"? No other blocker provide you this statistic.
-------------------------
block
uBO actually does more with less: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-and-others:-Blocking-ads,-trackers,-malwares#. That benchmark is a bit old, I expect uBO would actually do better nowadays.

Ghostery blocks *only* what is in its library (under 3000 filters last I checked).

uBO is open-ended in what it can block, and it actually provides the tools to disclose *all* the connections made by a web page, and the ability to point-and-click to block those connections. See https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide#.

Adblock is no longer a match for uBlock Origin -- there are many things it can not block which uBO can block -- especially when it comes to sites using anti-blocker mechanisms. For example: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Inline-script-tag-filtering#concrete-examples-of-usefulness

For the doc: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki

uBO is uncompromisingly pro-users, I do expect it to be more and more the target of some who have a pro-ads/trackers/data miners bias.

YouTube videos had been playing with a black screen for weeks (forcing me to refresh the page until they worked) and I couldn't figure out why. Turns out it was caused by my Ad Block Plus extension, since they seemed to work when I disabled it. I got rid of ABP and downloaded this and now I can watch ad-free YouTube videos with no issues. Finally.

Blocks them facebook ads, Adblock was just not doint it lately :(

Ad blocking works fine, but the UI is completely unusable without tooltips or other hints as to WTF any of the buttons do. Even on the GitHub Wiki I can't find out what the -/+ columns are supposed to do.
-------------------------
block
Trust me I have tried them all on every different platform and browser. uBlock Origin not only does a better job at blocking ads than all others, but also uses far less system resources than the likes of adblock plus etc.. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
-------------------------
block
The logger:
uBlock Origin comes with a logger, which gives the ability to inspect what uBlock is doing with network requests and DOM elements, whether something is blocked or allowed, and which filter, if any, matched a network request or DOM element
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger
-------------------------
block
works great. but sometimes you need to unblock on a page, and like adblock, i would like that option on the ublock menu. i dont need to shut it off for the whole site, just that page thats being blocked. like the auto update too.

Just spell out the details of what "doesn't  work", somebody will probably be able to help. Here is a list of reasons of why blocking an image may not work:

https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Element-picker#the-removed-element-reappear-when-you-reload-the-page

- The URL or selector for the blocked element has variable part(s) in it, which changes each time a page is loaded.

- Cosmetic filtering is disabled for the site, or globally.

- You un-checked My filters in the 3rd-party filters pane in the dashboard.

- There is a static filter in one of the 3rd-party filter lists in use which counters your filter.

This is the most aggressive ad blocker I've used. Too aggressive to recommend to non-tech users but good for those that know their way around detecting if an ad blocker is causing problems.
-------------------------

Much better than adblock, but it blocks webpages for me. Why would you block an entire webpage? You're not an antivirus program. Let us turn this "feature" off, and if there is a way in the settings, I haven't found it.
-------------------------
block
This ad blocker was written for geeks. The average person shouldn't have to hand-code rules in order for the thing to function as expected. I, too, had entire sites blocked. Other places I frequent, like Southwest.com, had the entire background and header image stripped. Yes, I know I could go up and click the big power button to stop blocking ads on southwest.com, but that's stupid. As sell-out as Adblock has become, at least it still did a good job of blocking ads. Quite honestly, I hadn't even noticed any performance difference between it and uBlock Origin. I've considered going back to Adblock a few times since installing uBlock Origin but because a good friend recommended it to me, I keep on trying to give it a chance. Only a few more fuck-ups left where it blocks the entire site or large portions of it, before I throw it in the trash.
-------------------------
block
I heard that uBlock Origin was less resource hungry than other adblock plug-ins, so I gave it a try. Wow, it completely blew me away. It effectively blocked out all kinds of ads. Even Pandora ads are blocked. The other plug-ins don't do that. I love it so much that I installed it on all my browsers.
-------------------------
block
Hey dev, liked the extension. sometimes when i left click on the button the menu does not drop down showing all sites blocked etc. also when i right click and select options, only one option is displayed which is to remove it. is this a bug or i am using it wrong? pls help!

BTW im using a 32 bit win7   and chrome 
Thanks

blocks too much.

Much better than Adblock and Adblock plus. This actually blocks ads.
-------------------------
block
Has replaced Adblock Plus and AdBlock for me.

My only request is that you add an option to disable blocking on all pages at the click of a button. The disable option at present only applies to the current page. This doesn't work for cashback sites where you just need to quickly disable blocking everywhere for a few mins.
-------------------------

Does what adblock doesn't.... it blocks ALL ads

Screw Adblock who got sold out. This one has more customisation and blocks every ads just as it's supposed to!

Doesn't seem like Youtube ads get blocked anymore. Am I the only one?
-------------------------
block
This adblocker is the best. People talking about Ad Blocker plus etc. They need to checkout ublock origin. This app is easy on your CPU. I did a side by side by having Adblock plus along side ublock origins to see the number of ads that are blocked. Ublock origins shows more numbers of ads blocked than adblocker plus. Get this now.

Had to be disabled on virtually every online shopping site I visit--I couldn't figure out why the sites were suddenly breaking, then would see that uBlock Origin had tons of blocks on sites that weren't displaying ads, except I guess for their own products.  Just too inconvenient to have to be constantly turning it off to make websites work.
-------------------------
block
It is not working, it doesn't block ads on youtube, which is the biggest reason I installed it.
-------------------------
block
Works so smoothly I forget it's on most of the time. Adblockplus worked well, but after a while websites would catch on to it and block me.
-------------------------
block
great adblocker. how do i disable blocking on youtube though?
-------------------------
detect
Please don't install it. Use adblock plus. That's the most safe adblocker. My antivirus software is detecting an "exploit" in this ublock origin extension. This extension also affects some webpages layout and functionality.
-------------------------
block
Would get higher, but it's blocking Google Drive functionality.
-------------------------

It does its job very well. Only qualm is that just recently Twitch ads have been getting through for some reason.

Never mind, I think it might have been the strict blocking shenanigans.
-------------------------

worked perfectly for a long time, now today it randomly started having problems. expando buttons on reddit are now invisible as well as some other reddit elements, not blocking twitch stream ads, and there's a giant white band on my new tab page...

For all That downvoted this because of the new Permissions.... READ THE BLOG!!!

uBlock now requires a new permission, "Change your privacy-related settings": for uBlock to be able to disable the setting "Prefetch resources to load pages more quickly".
This will ensure no connection is opened at all for blocked requests: It's for your own protection privacy-wise.
-------------------------
block
It seems to work okay but it fails to block quite a lot of items. Comparatively, Adblock Plus was blocking about twice as many ads as uBlock was. The idea is nice, it just doesn't work very well.
-------------------------
block
best adds block ihave tried,, keep devoloping
-------------------------
block
Great for speed but this extension blocked the menus on quite a few websites.  The menus would only work after disabling uBlock but they work fine with ABP.  Sadly, I'll need to go back to the more memory hungry ABP since enabling/disabling uBlock on various sites is just more work than an adblocker should require.
-------------------------
block
recently ads have overloaded yahoo mail in chrome, ublock doesnt block any at all unless you manually select each ad and they keep popping up

Super user tool for all users. Should really be called "block all the unwanted, crappy website annoyances that pop up while you are browsing tool". I would even rate it higher. :)

block
Long-time Adblock user.

Installed this, and instantly noticed an difference in speed.

And it blocks everything and anything I'd need it to, just as much as Adblock or Adblock Plus have done for me in the past.

Props to gorhill, good work!
-------------------------

Effectively blocks adds. I also like it for the privacy it offers. I used to run Disconnect in parallel to uBlock, but the later prevents sites from tracking very efficiently so I decided to shut down Disconnect entirely.

Also few days ago I found out that the same developer has made another plugin, the uMatrix (µMatrix) which seems to be even better than uBlock but it is trickier because it is only for the advanced users.

Easy to use. Blocks Ads and has a Picker function to remove sections of Facebook that I don't want to see. Low memory usage.
-------------------------
block
blocks more ads
-------------------------
block
Works really well and blocks all of the ads on all the websites I browse. Certain poorly written websites will break when ads are removed - in those cases you can tweak the blocking rules until it works, or just disable uBlock for that website entirely. Don't use Chrome without this extension!
-------------------------
block
it blocks way too many "random" stuff, which isn't in any way related to ads (e.g. why the hell is this image blocked: <img src="/img/avatar/default_company.png" style="max-height: 45px;max-width: 60px;"> ???).
therefore went back to adblock plus.
-------------------------
block
Looks decent but only supports block-all-except-whitelist.

I don't want to use a blocker unless it has an allow-all-except-blacklist mode.  (ie. use the same list of "ad domains", but don't block anything on any domain unless specifically requested)
-------------------------
block
Light on resources, but it seems to block a lot more than ads. I have to disable it on certain sites to get content to display properly.
-------------------------
block
Works great blocking ads; unfortunately it also blocks a variety of non-advertising related javascript, leading to rendering issues on multiple websites.
-------------------------
block
Way too restrictive, it blocked surveys and legitimate download sites.

And I couldn't even fix that because the options are confusing.
-------------------------
block
Blocks all ads while keeping web browsing lightning fast!

I've tried many alternatives such as Adblock and Adblock Plus, but uBlock has a much smaller memory footprint compared to the others and still manages to block just as many ads!
-------------------------
block
I could not uninstall ABP quick enough after reading about its paid acceptable ads campaign.  This uBlock works much better.  It blocks more stuff, its faster, and takes up less memory.  Oh and its open source to boot so you can see what its doing if you are so inclined.
-------------------------
block
Prevents other plugins from working properly (i.e. Forecast Fox can't pop up the weather window).

Prevents web sites from working properly, i.e. Capitol One 360, you can't login with this enabled.

A number of other sites wouldn't allow me to log in with this installed.
So, it's blocking more than ads, it's blocking functionality.   

Not clear from settings, etc. how to try to enable this.  If I turn off ALL the filters I can get some things to work.  But adding in ANY filters kills things like logging into Capitol One.

Smaller footprint, yup, but going back to AdBlockPlus so things work.
-------------------------
block

i keep wondering why it always blocked when using adblock program previously

fails to block google search ads, manually adding them to the black list does  nothing.
-------------------------
block
Much better than ABP, however, it does tend to block a bit too much. It would be nice if it was easier to block individual page elements like you can in ABP. 

Like, for instance, when on certain video sites, it manages to block the ads, but it also blocks some content. And therefore I can't turn it off because I'd lose the adblocking, but I'm also losing some content. 

But either way, it is still infinitely better than ABP. Thanks for creating this!
-------------------------
block
It can do exaclty what i needed: block a single url from downloading.
-------------------------
block
It is very lighweight, but it blocked a ton of stuff that wasn't ads. For example, on Google Translate, it blocked all the alternate translations and said it was blocking 225 ads!
-------------------------
block
I am a web developer (who doesn't have ads) who has been hurt by uBlock.

I installed uBlock to block ads because it is more efficient that ABP.  But then I noticed that uBlock also blocks a ton of important web development tools such as crash reporters (bugsnag, newrelic) and even self-hosted webstats (piwik), which means that it makes it harder to ensure my website users have a quality experience.

Most people install ublock as an ad-blocker but do not realize (because it isn't clear) that it blocks nearly all third parties services, even if they are not related to serving ads.

A list of essential web development services blocked by uBlock by default include: bugsnag, newrelic, piwik,  optimizely, mixpanel, customer.io, and pingdom to name just a few.

As uBlock becomes the new normal, blocking essential web dev tools (that are not related to serving ads) by default is harmful to web developers such as myself.
-------------------------
block
Fast, slim, small and effective.
One of few addons that brings a real meaning to "µ" (micro)
 
But there is one feature I miss, and are a dealbreaker for me:
Being able totemporarily disable it alltogether.
I can temporarily disable µblock for the current site, but as soon as I click on an ad that IS interesting, trying to open a new window, it's blocked despite that µblock is temporarily disabled.

I have to turn the addon off completely, and restart the browser in order to click on that interesting ad.
-------------------------
block
Not as lightweight as claimed. Absolutely jams on certain sites, the block counter spiralling and the browser window virtually locked up. Needlessly blocks icons.
-------------------------
block
This is pretty comprehensive protection, blocking more than any single protection extension in Google's Catalog right out of the box. Tweaking it is surprisingly easy and I've never had a single issue with it breaking a website to date.
-------------------------
block
Works great and low in resource usage.

It can be a little overzealous in its default configuration. Be sure to visit the Settings page and uncheck any lists you don't want used. For example, the Social blocking list may block some website functionality, so you may want to uncheck that one.
-------------------------
block
Would be really usefull to have "Pause all blocking" (or similar) button
-------------------------
block
Please remove the default setting of blocking social media, not every techie is anti-social.

Good twitter and FB plugin to be blocked too

Fast but overly zealous blocker. Blocks much more than ads, like Google Analytics, Google and Facebook-based single sign-ons, etc.

I just want an ad blocker.
-------------------------

Half the mem usage of ABP. Been an avid ABP for 10 years... but going to uBlock! Better blocking and no need for Ghostery either.
-------------------------

Sure it blocks ads but for me it blocked a lot of web pages from simply working. I kept whitelisting site after site until I just decided to drop this.
-------------------------

I'd give it five stars, but that stupid OKCupid image with the message begging you to donate them $5 because you're using an ad blocking extension (in this case, uBlock) has come back up. It seems either OKCupid has either found a way around the filter I imported from AdBlock again, or a bug has crept up into the system.
-------------------------
block
Chrome suddenly stopped working today, and I narrowed the problem down to uBlock. When disabled everything works fine. I guess I'll have to find something else. Also, your annoying popups whenever a popup is blocked kind of defeats the purpose. A popup is a popup, no matter if it's yours or a website.

Twitter has been severly dysfunctional, examples: No timelines on Home Page or any user No Bookmarks or Lists Some Notifications but clicking on didn't show a tweet, just persons profiles Pages freezing I logged in and out, cleared cache and cookies and disabled "Tweak New Twitter" but still the same. Long story short I finally disabled all extensions and added back one by one and U Block Origin was the culprit. I don't have a Git Hub account but went to your Issues page: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/13357 and the third item down -- clicked the "purge all caches" button and nothing happened but there was an "update" button and clicked that. Re-enabled U B O on Twitter and still the same problem. Twitter has probably made some kind of change to break U B O on its site, I know they are making various changes relative to Elon Musk's purchase deal.

Its been happening to me, too. On both YouTube and Twitch. You can easily work around it on YouTube: as soon as the player loads, it shows you how long the video about to be played is, and ads are never long. Just keep an eye at the bottom of the player, you'll see two time tags separated by a "/" symbol. If you're about to watch an in-depth review of a new game, and the right tag says "0:22" or something, just hit refresh or F5 and the add will disappear. Doesn't work on Twitch, though. There was a specific blocker for the site, skipped ads by quickly changing video resolution repeatedly when an ad was detected. It's been banned from the Web Store. Guess I'll just have to find a mini-hobby to entertain myself while they are running, because they show up to 6 ads in a row, each up to 90 seconds long. I'm unemployed and insomniac, for crying out loud, I waste enough time as it is!

I cannot connect to a remote system with chrome remote desktop on my local network if uBlock origin extension is enabled. Using the uBlock Origin "disable on site" button does not fix the problem.

This is a very minor issue, but uBlock Origin is blocking the following pop-up prompt on YouTube: "The following content has been identified by the YouTube community as inappropriate or offensive to some audiences." *user must click the prompt: "I understand and wish to proceed." * It seems like the uBlock Origin extension thinks this scenario is a pop-up ad, when it is actually a YouTube user interface prompt. To get around this, I have to disable the extension. An example of this issue can be observed by trying to watch the following video on YouTube with uBlock Origin active: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moK9JVvbbZ0 However, this video is not the only case. This occurs with any YouTube video that automatically generates the explicit content prompt. Other than that, thank you so much for such an amazing browser extension!

This past week ublock has not been working like it usually was blocking all ads on twitch.

Dear developer, I am trying to register on a site I previously blocked to login and make a comment but disabling uBlock Origin does not help. Because it jumps to another site checks that uBlock Origin is on and jumps back with error so quickly that I can't even see what redirect was it. I only see that uBlock Origin icon turns brown for a moment and then dims. Please add a pause button for all sites. It could actually be a small vertical bars in a corner which could change into right pointed triangle on click. With a tooltip saying pause for all and resume for all.
-------------------------
block
On sites that don't allow you to access the page unless you disable ublock origin, ads continue to be blocked after it is disabled which prevents me from using any of those sites. How can this be fixed?

First, off this is a great extension, made even greater by the open source license. Thank you for putting so much effort into this extension. I've done a bit of research, and it seems like Amazon Prime Video ads come from the same server, so the normal method of blocking the ads probably won't work. Is there any way to block the Amazon Prime Video ads? I find it profoundly stupid that I have to pay a subscription in order to see ads in my TV shows. Thanks!

It would be very much appreciated if you could review your process of blocking the Connatix.com video player. Initially their player was used primarily for ads, which is likely why it's blocked entirely, but now many sites use it to host full video content. AdBlock Plus has found a way to only block the ads that appear in the player, and allow users to watch the main content like YouTube. Funker530.com, which does about 2M views a month, is a good example of a site where uBlock is disrupting the the user experience, and we have no choice but to tell them to use AdBlock Plus instead. As a last resort we will have to put up a warning banner telling users not to use uBlock, which I would prefer not to do. Thank you very much for looking into this issue!

I can't block ads on facebook using ublock origin!!! how do I do that?

Around a month ago (end of October) Microsoft Edge (with Chrome) and Firefox latest versions started blocking images in slide show on web sites. The only way I have been able to see these images is to disable U-block org. In Firefox I tried Privacy & Security's Standard, Strict, and Custom with all elements checked and unchecked and the images were not displayed. Closing and restarting Firefox did not work either. I have done similar test in Microsoft Edge. U-Block Org version 84.0 64-bit

I was warned about a site, and prompted to select temporary or permanently to ignore the warning. I misread it, and clicked 'permanently', wanting it to be permanently blocked. Now in "My Rules", I have a filter / rule which cannot be removed, or so it appears. Please advise.

I use uBlock and it reliably blocks all ads. But I have a huge problem, which makes the app almost unusable for me: at about every second time I start Chrome or when I let it run for about 10 Minutes or so, the app crashes and needs to be "repaired"! I can't find any reason for that. Browser is Chrome (most actual Version), OS Windows 10 (1909). I need a fix for that problem, because it is annoying as heck.

Is there any way to block twitch ads? It used to block them, but now they changed the system and now its so annoing.
-------------------------
block
When I hover over dropdowns in website they appear, but when I click Ublock to select elements the dropdown disappears because I no longer am able to hover over it. I can block just about anything on a site except for sites that have dropdowns. This is extremely irritating because most of the sites I want to block stuff on all heavily utilize dropdowns. Is Ublock capable of blocking items in dropdowns or hover modals? I can't find any discussion about this topic of Ublock's limitation with dropdowns - am I the only person trying to block dropdown elements (eg. all of google's new rainbow-blob icons)?

IDK what happened with the extension but now i can't pick more than 1 ad to block (the eyedropper button). is it intentional to make the user pay for more utility or something? or maybe the web that can detect ad blocker so you can only block 1 only? the pick button is so useful before because i can pick anything that i considered ads (especially the one that considered gambling and sexual ads)
-------------------------

Seems like YouTube just changed the way their ads work because while uBlock still blocks the ads themselves, YouTube shows a white screen with a skip ad button in their place.

The extension is no longer blocking mid roll ads during twitch streams, instead you're getting a 'you're using a third party app' with a purple screen for the duration of the ad.

Hi! I blocked some annoying elements on a news-site with quite a bit of adds (automatically blocked by ublock). Unfortunately one of them seem linked to the "bread text" i WANT to see, so now i can either disable ublock on this site (and see ALL annoying adds) or enable it and hide relevant material. How do i see what elements i have myself added and remove them, and ONLY them? Thank you!

prevent
Lately, uBlock Origin has been presenting this page often... "uBlock Origin has prevented the following page from loading:..." Can't we have an option to not show this page? It's just an extra window that pops up telling us that uBlock is doing it's job, but the job we want uBlock to do is prevent extra windows from popping up!

Yo, could be a bust, but try this; Open uBlock menu, expand the menu until you get the (Zap, Eyedrop, Logger & Dashboard) Open the logger. before refreshing the page clear the logger if there are anything there. Refresh the page and try and start the video. (We are not expecting it work yet, we are just gathering info in the logs) Then proceed to filter the logs for 'blocked', go through the list and try and locate where it block the video feed. When you (think you) got it expand it and go to the static filter tab, from here add an exception to allow the video feed from this site. (Recommend to make the rule as general as possible) When the rule is added refresh the page and check if it worked. If it did not work, I recommend removing the rule we just added, this can be done from the uBlock dashboard under 'My filters' Good luck, Have fun :)
-------------------------

Hi, The zap function is only there to quickly remove pesky annoyances, this is just a temporarily removal. So yes, when you reload the page the elements you removed will return. If obliterating the pesky elements with your trusty zap gun isn't satisfying enough, I would recommend looking into if you are able to remove them permanently. As I am not familiar with what or where you are removing elements, I'm not sure how you can do this exactly. :) But I would start by.. looking in the uBlock logger and try to single out the element you that is annoying you and add a rule to block it. (I would of course test this afterwards to check that you haven't blocked something important. That then would refuse the web page to function properly.) *I'm not the developer of uBlock, just a random dude on the interwebs*

Spent a while trying to figure out why an online VISA gift card wouldn't show the card number, CCV, etc. and it was because UBO was blocking the image as an ad. Website was vanillaereward.com.

I don't see the option to block all but a list of sites. It only allows you to add sites you wish to use uBlock on but I would like to use it on all but one site.

Hi, the extension blocks the cookie setting pop up on most websites (since EU is making it mandatory). And because the cookie setting is blocked, some of the websites' functionality don't work.

Hi, late reply. But better late then never? :) Here you have a link to the documentation. https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide But basically the ++ and -- is just and indicator on how many network were blocked or allowed. So basically one + or - = 1 to 9 network requests blocked or allowed. So if we throw another minus or plus on, ex. -- or ++ = 10-99 network requests blocked or allowed and on and on it goes :)

It only seems to work as a one off or on the individual page I blocked the element on which defeats the whole purpose of a pop up blocker to do it automatically.

The .aspx pages are presumably either tables of content or text document replicas that, maybe, the uBlock extension does not detect as a webpage so it can block any pop-ups there. I'm not defending the developer by saying this, as it really needs work to sort this out, but rather trying to help you understand why it's not working there. Maybe they'll get it working in the near future.

Not sure if this is a new issue, or if I just noticed it. I've had google docs and google sheets open today, and uBlock is getting at least two pings every few seconds or so. Sheets racked up over 700 pings in an hour and the doc has just under 100. Most of them are [item].gstatic.com, [item].googleusercontent.com and [item].google.com. I don't actually see anything changing on the page, so is it just blocking trackers or something? I'm almost tempted to disable uBlock for that page because the ticker's distracting.

IMHO - blame the website for trying to force you to accept their stalkers. For every website there is another with the same or similar products. Or, drop your anti-stalker and privacy protection and let them have their way. Sites like you describe are extorting your privacy - is that a good place to visit?

Today, youtube ads appear to have begun slipping past ublock's filter. The main page banner ad is particularly annoying, as it appears to be loading behind everything where I can't see it but can hear it. Actually, it might be possible that ublock is not working at all, but I can't tell that for sure because most ad services are blocked by my hosts file before ublock ever gets a chance to interact with them. Either way, something is broken, and now I'm bombarded by the most annoying ads on the web.

Sometimes some YouTube videos cause a huge number of blocked messages. 10k, 20k, 30k, ... I saw 48k maximum blocked ads on one page. refreshing the page, restarting chrome and restarting the pc did not change the situation. After some time, this video stopped showing excessive advertising counter. This behavior I met for the third time this week. I like your application and I would like to report such behavior. Perhaps this behavior is YouTube for anti-blocking.
-------------------------
block
You do realize that the number is just for people who are curious for how many ads are currently being blocked. Numbers in the thousands aren't uncommon on yt, or many popular websites around the internet. And yes, youtube is trying their best to place as many different ads/trackers as possible, since it goes towards their improving their R&D team. No need to report such behavior, since it is the intended purpose of the extension. Also, yes, youtube is doing some anti-ad blocking, this has been reported for a couple of days now, and I assume the developer of uBlock is working on fixing this. The problem isn't the page, chrome, or your computer; it is Youtube and their attempts at making as much money out of you as possible.

Not a virus, you need to know the definition of a computer virus before making such allegations. And if it won't uninstall, it is a problem with your computer/browser. There is absolutely nothing the extension can do to stop you from uninstalling it from chrome. Also yes, it cannot die, since chrome automatically attempts to reboot all extensions if they either crash/killed by the computer (chrome's fault, nothing you can do). A feature of the extension is that it isn't going to close, it will continue to protect your browser against whatever the developer thinks necessary. If you believe this extension is causing issues with certain websites, while on the web page, you can press the icon for the extension, and by pressing the blue power button and refreshing the page, it will no longer attempt to block anything on this website. Also yes, viruses are removable, but highly powerful malware may not be, but don't fear, since uBlock automatically brings up warning when entering sites known to distribute malware.

Dear developers, Nowadays website layouts are optimized to display ads and teasers. I use "block element" for each unwanted element in header/footer/side panels. End result - huge empty margins. This is much better than ads, but can still be improved. Desired features for "preview/bock/pick/quit" panel: * Add button "Only show selected" that hides everything BUT selected and sets margins/padding of outer containers to zero. Use case: select the only relevant pane in one click and maximize the pane. * Add controls to toggle "show/hide/highlight" and to unblock unblock elements affected by user defined filters. Use case: restore accidentally blocked element.

1. add button "undo recently added block rule". This is useful in case we didn't set a good rule after all, as it might have ruined the website a bit 2. Show visual list of what was blocked, to be able to unblock what we actually want This is useful even for cases that the default blocker has done bad things to how the website work. 3. Ability to reset all settings of current website. 4. report a website has bad behavior after using default blocking rules. This can help with others who might visit it.

What do you mean by a WordPress plugin? What exactly do you need to do specifically? WordPress is a tool for creating web-sites (server-side) and any ad-blocker is for preventing network activity on already created web-sites (client-side). If you own a web-site, simply analyze which components (dependencies) cause the unwanted activity and remove them or adjusts their settings. If you are a user of a web-site, uBlock Origin does not care which tools it was created with (WordPress or anything else), so in case of a problem you should report specific problem to list maintainers. If you still have questions, post at official uBlock Origin sub-Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/.
-------------------------
block
TL;DR: Consider the following filters ||www.google.com/logos/doodles/$image will stop doodles from downloading, www.google.com###lga will hide the entire block.

You are looking for uBlock Origin Dashboard > "Settings" > "Privacy" section, specifically "Disable pre-fetching (to prevent any connection for blocked network requests)" and, may be (unlikely), "Disable hyperlink auditing". I'd recommend reading about these options and considering privacy drawbacks vs. load speed improvements (by clicking "i" icons next to them and on the uBlock Origin Wiki). Here are the docs: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Settings#privacy

I run a simple website, www.sustainable-properties-forsale.com which has lots of photos of properties. There are no adverts on the site but the pictures are being blocked. Can you tell me why this is and what I can do to stop it since it is inhibiting people from using the site.
-------------------------
block
My first response was cut short, so here is the rest: For example, EasyList contains rule /adverts/, which matches location of most of your images www.sustainable-properties-forsale.com/adverts/*, so you should contact EasyList maintainers asking to create an exception. Alternatively, since pattern "adverts" is likely to show up in almost any ad blocking list, you could rename the folder and likely avoid the problem altogether.
-------------------------
block
This is external filter issue (most likely EasyList). Please use the Logger to identify the problematic rules and report them to maintainers: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger Specifically, your images are located at http://www.sustainable-properties-forsale.com/adverts/* and EasyList has rule /adverts/ which matches them. You could try to contact EasyList maintainers to add an exception rule, or simply change the image addresses to, say, /images/* (since /adverts/* is "screaming" to be blocked by ad blockers). Note: This might not be the only rule affecting your website, but images load for me once I disable it.

Hi, First off, thank you for this incredible extension, it's easily the best ad-blocker I've ever used. But I have a website that won't let me read its content unless I disable it.

Ublock is no longer working for message boards hosted on Boards2go.com. Normally (without any adblocking software) B2g will show a medium-sized banner at the top of each page. However, I and several other users believe that B2g and/or their ad supplier have enabled a malicious script to bypass adblocking software. Whenever you have your adblocker turned on (and we've tried it with multiple ones), the normal ad banners are replaced by larger, very intrusive banners that are sometimes borderline pornographic - sometimes multiple on the same page so that they take up the whole screen. This issue started some time ago and for a while Ublock was the only adblocker capable of hiding them and keeping them hidden. However, it seems the malicious ads have upped their game and Ublock is no longer able to keep them gone. I've tried different settings and filters and nothing works! Please, PLEASE fix this - these ads make the site nearly unusable. My site has used B2g for 9 years and if this continues we will have to consider the time-consuming hassle of switching to another host. (Other info: I use Chrome version 63.0.3239.132 but this issue seems to happen regardless of browser)

With uBlock Origin or uMatrix 'enabled', inserting pictures in e-mails does not work. Everything works fine up to selecting the picture on the hard disk and loading it, i.e. the progress bar shows that the picture has been loaded, but then nothing happens any more. On the pop-up screen with the progress bar, the blue 'insert' button on the lower left remains faded out and the two gray bars in the lower right do not react. The same probably goes for other attachments that are handled by the same GUI dialogue. Disabling uBlock Origin and uMatrix, the normal behaviour is that when the uploading progress bar reaches the right side, i.e. when uploading is complete, the pop-up dialogue for inserting a picture (selecting it from the hard disk) will simply disappear and the picture shows up in the e-mail message that is being composed. Issues like these are what makes the use of security and privacy software so tedious. Has anybody ever thought of not blocking them and instead feed bogus info, so that privacy is not compromised but the web works as it is supposed to?

TL;DR: If you hate any kind of telemetry or are a pro-user and know what words "[software] community" mean, you want uBlock Origin. Also, uBlock Origin might occasionally break, especially if you use an unusual Chromium variant. If you want a slightly worse but a very consistent experience in any browser and are willing to compromise some of your privacy in exchange, Adblock Plus might be better for you. In the later case, I'd recommend looking into AdGuard -- a commercial company offering technical support help desk, but with a different financial model: getting money from users, not advertisers. (You may choose to pay for the product, and are guaranteed that you won't become the product.) Their browser extension is free, while the revenue comes from selling "advanced" licenses to users for standalone computers and mobile programs implementing features impossible for an extension. So they do need to sell your privacy to advertisers, and instead rely on money paid by some users. For example, I personally bought lifetime license for Android to have DNSCrypt (encrypted DNS) and I'm really happy with it. Also, both block pretty much the same ads, since all adblockers just follow instructions specified by the filter lists you choose and all lists are maintained by volunteers external to either project, except for Acceptable Ads (maintained by Eyeo GmbH). There are some differences due to uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus having slightly different syntaxes, but most rules are compatible with either one. Adblock Plus is a commercial product from a very financially successful company (its developer Eyeo GmbH pulls in revenue in hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Acceptable Ads, while employing about 100 people). On the other hand, uBlock Origin is completely non-commercial hobby project by a very talented individual (Raymond Hill) in his free time, who believes any financial activity might eventually compromise the primary objective (protect user choice and privacy), and thus does not even have a dedicated website or forum to avoid any financial activity. Adblock Plus offers consistency and limitations of a mass-market commercial product (and takes a bit of your privacy in return, even if you disable Acceptable Ads). uBlock Origin offers complete privacy and is more efficient (from my personal experience and according to all articles online I could find), but if you have a question, you'll go to the user community (a topic on Reddit) and you might be expected to read documentation. Here is some stuff I'd really recommend reading: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Why-don't-you-accept-donations%3F Privacy Policies: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Privacy-policy https://adblockplus.org/en/privacy

I've tried combining different ad-blockers with this one. Usually ad's just get blocked by both as usual but some are programmed so they block out other ones. To the point it will probably do nothing and let the other one work fine or it will be disabled by your ADGuardADblocker so AdGuardAdBlocker will disable the ad's without this uBlock Orgin doing anything or just block any ad's including the ones that are previously blocked by other one or they will (best case scenario) make up for the other one by blocking ad's the other one won't or (worst case scenario) they will cancel each other out so no ad's are blocked or this Ublock Orgin will shut down AdGuardAdBlocker so its does all the work or it will simply not correctly install cause of AdGuardAdBlocker.

Dear Raymond Hill! I am very irritated by the strict blocking behavior of this extension. It makes absolutely zero difference for me whether the obtrusive pop-up, rudely interrupting what I'm doing at the moment is an advertisement, or a notification about a blocked advertisement.

Thank you for the reply. I'm not sure if we're talking about the same thing. I added several sites to "my filters", so the filter is present, and instead of silently blocking them, uBlock Origin returns the strict blocking page with the exclamation mark in the orange triangle and the text: uBlock Origin has prevented the following page from loading: ... Because of the following filter ... Found in: My filters Go back Disable strict blocking for ... Temporarily Permanently I don't want this notification, I want strict blocking to do its thing silently. If we are talking about the same thing, the necessity to report each and every site I intend to block is very counter productive, and I don't understand why it is required at all, if I already have the custom filter in my own rules.

Popup tabs/windows are blocked only when there is a matching popup filters. If you get the document-blocked tab/window, and it does not close itself, it's because there is no popup filters, you need to report to filter list maintainers so that they add a popup filter. Other blockers also require the popup filter, but in their case they would load the content instead of blocking it like uBO.

Shortly: To disable uBO on a particular domain, click on UO shield on the right of the search/address bar and in the menu that appears click on large ON/OFF blue button. https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface By default, uBO is in "allow by default" mode thus blocks only stuff that was deemed untrustworthy, therefore I'd recommend being cautious about what you download (e.g. make sure it is a PDF, not executable disguised as a PDF). However, false positives are possible, so if you have time, you could use the Logger to find the false positive filter and then inform the filter list maintainers about it. https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger

I don't think this is what was intended, so I'm reporting it as a problem. I just noticed yesterday when I had a Google Doc open that the blocked ad count was steadily climbing the longer I worked in that tab. I finally opened the logger, and it appears that each time the document auto-saves, uBlock is counting it as a blocked ad. That's fine, except that once it gets over 500 or so it starts to slow the browser down a bit. Not a lot, just a little, but again, I don't think that's supposed to be happening. It happens in Google Sheets, too. If I refresh the tab it resets the counter, but that's annoying to have to do.

A moment ago I lost complete control of Chrome because of uBlock Origin. I loaded a page on Reddit (which I've been to hundreds of times and have an exception for it to not block anything) and out of the blue I started getting new tabs that would open to warn me about how it was blocking a script from running. I normally get one of those when it's working, this time I got about 50. They were coming faster than I could close them. Keep in mind, on this page I was opening I had uBlock set to not do anything on all of Reddit.com and I didn't click anything on said page. It was decided it was going to go wild with these new tabs. I had to close all of Chrome to regain control. I've been using this for years and this is the first problem I've had. Just wanted to bring it to your attention because it was incredibly strange... I guess I'll let you know if it happens again.

What is the exact problem you have? uBlock Origin should not interfere with anything -- it only does what you tell it to do (block specific requests and hide specific elements). Here are my GUESSES what you might have: 1. Extensions [something] failed to redirect request to [something]. This happens when you just installed an extension and Chrome did not inform other extensions of this change. Solution: restart Chrome. 2. uBlock Origin hides something of Blur Solution: Open the logger and see what is going on, add a white-list for the problem. 3. uBlock Origin injects a script that interferes with Blur Open the logger and see what is going on, add a white-list for the problem. 4. uBlock Origin blocks Blur's network requests. Probably, Blur makes behind-the-scenes network requests (if it is an extension and not merely a link to a web app). uBlock Origin can filter behind-the-scenes requests, but it is not a default behavior. If it does, you had checked option "I am an advanced user" with a link to "required reading". Solution: If so, you are using a very powerful feature that does require some knowledge... so read the required reading.

I belive many people who want advanced blocking options are using uBlock and uMatrix at the same time because uMatrix is great at blocking things but on soudncloud for example it will block ads but will also stop autoplay when an ad should be playing. uBlock doesnt have this problem but I think it misses the advanced blocking matrix from uMatrix. I think having the best of both extensions in one UI would really improve this extension and would fix the need of having both extensions installed (and im pretty sure both use the same blocking mechanism at a lower level so it shouldnt be hard to do this right?).

I believe these are the two lines: @@||ups.com/*/WebTracking/track&dcs @@||ups.com/WebTracking/$xmlhttprequest I added wwwapps.ups.com as a whitelist, but the filter continues working. I would expect that my whitelist would override any filters, but this is not the case. Please check and advise. In the meantime, I'm disabling the Easy Privacy filter list.

UBlock has been working wonderfully well until now. Recently, Indian Express newspaper, http://indianexpress.com/ started demanding that I unblock their ads and would not allow me to visit their site. So, I stopped visitng their site. Today, their news item appeared on Google news, I clicked on it and there I see the page flloded with ads; UBlock failed to block their ads. Seems they were able to hack uBlock filter. I checked UBlock filter and it appeared non-functional! Lookks like Indian Express s/w disabled the uBlock. Can you fix this issue? You cann go to their website and test your product. Up until now, UBlock functioned outstandingly.

I suggest that a default minimal blocking setting be made available as an alternative to shutting off all blocking on a site. I have encountered online services that offer a choice of paying a monthly fee to use their service, or turning off the adblocker. While I'm annoyed, with having to watch ads, that's not why I use an adblocker. I use an adblocker for the security of not having my machine exposed to third-party sites associated with ads that infect machines with spyware. I would love to be able to turn on ads for sites that demand to be supported by watching ads, while not exposing my machine to malware risks associated with unblocked ads.

I gave it 5 stars. Some malware adapted to their code and will block content unless let it. Most likely you have also other setup problems. Of course if you run Windows or OSX nothing will help you for to long. If you are computer savvy I suggest getting a cinnamon based Linux (ex. Mint) or Chrome OS (very limited). Of course there is a point where to much screen time will make you through away all the devices (sounds like you are close)!

This is necessary to be able to: Disable "Prefetch resources to load pages more quickly" This will ensure no TCP connection is opened at all for blocked requests: It's for your own protection privacy-wise.[1] For pages with lots for blocked requests, this will actually remove overhead from page load (if you did not have the setting already disabled). When uBlock blocks a network request, the expectation is that it blocks completely the connection, hence the new permission is necessary for uBlock to do truthfully what it says it does.

Report these instances to filter list maintainers. Blockers work using filter list, and volunteers populate these filter lists with filters to block specific resources on specific web pages.

Btw. uBlock, when using "Block element" uses too many steps in the rule. In this case, each page also has a page-specific container. So a block rule would only work on one page. Manually editing the rule does fix this.

With the same filter lists, uBO will block as well as other blockers, -- actually better since it can also block popunders. So your blocker was blocking something uBO is not blocking, it's simply because you had more filters in the other blocker. Anyway, as usual, to provide an explanation it always comes down to specific, which you do not provide, so it's not possible to provide help.

I could update the list fine from my location. Maybe the server was down temporarily, or maybe the network request is blocked on your end for whatever reason -- you will have to investigate.

From here all works fine as far as I can tell. I see only one resource blocked with up-to-date default filter lists. Force an update of your filter lists, see if this works. If not, I would need to know which filter lists aside the default ones, in order to reproduce the issue -- a necessary step to figure why the issue is occurring.

Nothing changed, this issue has been present for a while: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1185 The _Save_ operation causes the browser to fetch the page again from the remote server, and for some reasons, as soon as a network request is blocked, the Save operation is aborted by the browser. I consider this a browser bug, you may want to file an issue with Chrome developers. Saving a page works fine with Chromium, but not with Chrome, so Chrome is doing something different.

Just to be clear: if you permanently disable strict blocking for only "www.google-analytics.com" (this is the choice offered to you by default), uBO will still strict-block everywhere else.
-------------------------

Of course not, you have to choose one or the other -- how can you block and not block at the same time? Other blockers would not block, so if you want the same behavior as other blockers, just disable strict blocking for `www.google-analytics.com`.

Yes. It's just a warning, there is really no harm. You could disable the blocking of Google Analytics in Ghostery so that only uBO blocks it -- that should prevent the warning from appearing.

The browser is responsible for updating the extension -- so if something does not work, you need to reach Google Chrome support. However be sure that you did not modify settings in uBO in such a way that you end up blocking behind-the-scene network requests, unless you know what you are doing, this could interfere with your browser's proper functioning.

Filters are out of date most of the time. They have the yellow "out of date" next to the filters. I wonder why they bother reporting it instead of just updating it themselves. I read somewhere that filters supposedly autoupdates every 4 days, however I don't know if it is working properly. How does it even keep track? What if you don't use the computer/browser everyday? At my friend house, it seems that ublock filters have been "out of date," most of the time. It seems Ublock doesn't know how "out of date" the filters actually are b/c the Chrome profile i set up is rarely used, sometimes weeks go in between usage if I am staying over at her house and using her computer. I know my filters may be weeks old, but ublock rarely autoupdates them. Does ublock updates every 4 days of browser usage, not whether the filters are more than 4 days old? I guess it isn't a big problem yet, as long as the addon block what it is supposed to and the addon is still awesome, but filter autoupdate mechanism may not be working correctly.
-------------------------
block
When I do a manual updates it works, so I don't think anything is blocking network requests. At home, it isn't a problem b/c I use Chrome almost every day and the mechanism works like advertised for my main Chrome profile. However, my rarely used guest profile for anybody other than me has the same out of date issue. The filters could be weeks out of date, but Ublock won't autoupdate them until I it seems I use the profile for at at least 4 consecutive days? So I guess ublock auto updates filters after 4 days of browser usages not whether or the filters are more than 4 days old?

uBO does not open a new tab, the browser does. uBO blocks the fetching of the document though for that new tab if there is a matching filter. You then chose to proceed or not. The ability to block the whole document is a feature specific to uBO. Other blockers will load the page even if there is a filter for it. This uBO feature is called "strict blocking": https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface#no-strict-blocking It is especially useful when a site tries to open nuisance or even malware site -- uBO will prevent the connection to even be made. Then you can choose to proceed ahead if you know the site ahead is actually safe, or close the tab.

Can you please explain why uBlock Origin need the 2 additional permissions in its last version: - Read and change data on all websites, - Change privacy-related settings When Chrome update the add-on, it automatically blocks it and ask for these addtional permissions.

At install time: ABP/AdBlock: you need to go into config to *remove* "Acceptable ads", otherwise it really won't block much stuff. uBlock Origin: you *may* need to go into config to *add* whatever regional filter list(s) you may want. There is *no* "acceptable ads" to un-check. So to claim other blockers block more does not make much sense. In any case: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/747

I came home today to find my PC (Win10 x64) wasn't asleep. I checked powercfg -requests and saw Chrome reporting "WebRTC has active PeerConnections". Looking in chrome://webrtc-internals/ the only entry is for: chrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/background.html, { servers: [], iceTransportType: all, bundlePolicy: balanced, rtcpMuxPolicy: negotiate }, Which is this extension. What is uBlock doing to keep WebRTC hung up and thus prevent my PC from sleeping? I took a dump of the WebRTC Internals page if you'd like it for any other info.

"Box ticked, change applied": I think [Apply changes] button exists because you may want to tick/un-tick several check-boxes. If "change applied" immediately this will lead to slowdown on every tick/un-tick. P.S. By the way - you don't need both "Fanboy’s Annoyance List" & "Fanboy’s Social Blocking List" because the 'Social' is included in 'Annoyance' 8338+13009=21347

Are you clicking "Apply changes" after you deactivated the filter lists? To confirm what filter list is causing what network request to be blocked, use the logger, it allows you to find which filter blocks what, and from which filter list(s) the filter comes from: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger#finding-from-which-lists-a-static-filter-originates

I use a number of TinyURL links on my website and on paper documents (for perfectly legitimate reasons - eg. http://tiny.cc/ukhtyx) and recently a number of my customers have been complaining that my site has malware, when in reality uBlock Origin (which I recommended or installed for them) is telling people that any link which uses Tiny.cc is a malware risk. I have contacted Malware Domains to ask them to undo this but I'm asking whether it would be possible to add a little more information to the block page to avoid people being scared off. It would certainly help calm a few nerves as many of the times I have seen this there are no real "risks". Thanks!
-------------------------
block
> to add a little more information to the block page I don't see what else can be added from uBO's point of view. Malware Domains is 3rd-party to uBO and I can't possibly investigate every single entry in there. As far as uBO is concerned, it just knows that a specific filter comes from a specific filter list -- this is what is disclosed on the block page.

You are still not providing *any* exact methodology/result figures, and whatever little information you provide flies in the face of common sense: To claim that "adblock" with default settings pages load faster than uBO with default settings is just complete nonsense. "Adblock" (whichever one you talk about) barely block anything with default settings, and the biggest factor which contributes to page load speed is all the bloat which is blocked. So to block less will always translate into slower page load. Also uBlock has ceased development months ago, and as such does not benefit any of the improvements brought into uBO, *including* performance improvement. So your claims is not only unsubstantiated, you keep stalling when asked for *details*, and your secret results/methodology make no sense and contradict findings from other sources, for example: https://www.raymond.cc/blog/10-ad-blocking-extensions-tested-for-best-performance/ At this point I can't conclude anything else than that you are trolling. Such statements as "reborn UBlock from you" supports that you are just trolling: uBlock Origin is the original uBlock as I envisioned it. Good trolling job, you got me to waste time to respond to you.

I'll give you a link that I can guarantee shows ads every time you load the page when you disable uBlock origin so you can test that it's a uBlock/filter issue, or another reason that isn't uBlock related. There are quite a few reasons you would not see ads even when hitting uBlocks power button. I will explain these other possible reasons. But first, open twitch.tv in another tab. If you already have one open, that's fine too. Just make sure that the power button is 'ON', aka uBlock is blocking ads on twitch. Now go here, with uBlock turned ON: www.twitch.tv/esl_csgo/v/25893492 You should see a screen that says "we are currently playing ads, gameplay is paused until ads are over." Sit there and wait for 10-15 seconds. Sit there until you realize this screen isn't an ad. just how they 'punish' adblockers/ensure people they can watch ads and the gameplay is paused. So, you got 10+ seconds of this dumb screen. Power button 'ON' works correctly then. Now hit the power button 'OFF'. Hit CTRL+F5 to force refresh a new noncached version of the page, but F5 by itself is probably fine too. Video loads to the same screen, and ads start playing in the main window after 1-2 seconds, and usually another one pops up in the top right above the 'more videos' section. If you saw only the boring screen the first time, and you saw ads the second time the page loaded after you hit F5 to refresh (you MUST refresh for this test!) Then uBlock is working just fine. Now, for some other explanations: Not everybody's channel shows ads on entry (pre-roll ads). It's an option, not everybody has it either. And not everybody who has it uses it. Its the most annoying and intrusive ad style. and he best way to get yourself adblocked. Nobody wants to sit there for 90 seconds just to see if that hot grill streamer in the preview is actually a professional comp. player, or just extremely high-skilled. Kappa. For ads during the middle of a broadcast, like between games, or streamer has to poop, or the pizza guy is at his door, so broadcaster clicks 'play ad' as they leave -- for these ads the broadcaster must be partnered with Twitch. They will have the $4.99 subscribe button under their video if they are partnered. If they don't, they can't play ads either, and probably dont have their pre-rolls enabled, they want viewers to come in to a small channel as fast as possible so they can evnetually get the viewernumbers to become partnered. ^ tl;dr - Smaller streamers without sub buttons can't play ads. If it's a streamer with a sub button who says 'im gonna play some ads please disable adblock i would appreciate it", you clicking the power 'off' real fast? No, sorry, you're not going to 'catch it in time' to see the ad. Natural stream delay, and often the page needs a refresh after clicking the power off as well. Additionally, if you are just looking at the twitch.tv frontpage, ads don't play on the 'featured' streams when you load the page. Most of the twitch ad rules are in the regular "Easylist" subscription, if you'd like to take a closer look. But I think its probably working as intended. Cheers :^)

This could happens if uBlock Origin is unable to download the checksums.txt file from GitHub. There is a timeout however after which the page should display properly. If this happens and GitHub has no server issues, it could be that the network request is blocked. Be sure you did not setup uBO to block its own network requests (it's possible with advanced user mode + un-whitelisting behind-the-scene + default-deny). Use uBO's logger, select the "All" entry in the selector at the top, and see in there if there are network requests unexpectedly blocked.

SECOND REPLY (to Raymond): I found more: When I reload I click to get the red cross over the "font downloads" icon - which to me would indicate I disable this feature in the extension, because it is the GUI of the extension - and reload Yahoo Mail IN THE SAME TAB then fonts are blocked. However, when I load it in a NEW tab I get plenty of fonts. I now have 12 fonts listed in the resources overview for that page - this time with a red cross over the "A" icon.
-------------------------
block
I can only reply to myself here... You say font blocking is *disabled* by default. So by default this is how the GUI looks like: http://i.imgur.com/z5eftpD.png It says it blocked 102 font downloads. When I click on that icon it gets a red cross, meaning it is disabled. I interpret that as the blocking is disabled, meaning the functionality of the extension. But in either case I see - after reload of course - fonts datea1.woff, mail-ltr43.woff and uh.woff2 in the resources overview.
-------------------------
block
> Resources tab showed 3 remote fonts for Yahoo mail both times I went to Yahoo mail and I did not see any font resources not being blocked if the font-blocking switch is enabled. Please provide an example of URL of a font resource which is not blocked by uBlock on that site when the font-blocking switch is enabled. Blocking fonts is *not* turned on by default, the *only* way this per-site switch can be turned on is by the user clicking on it. Go into _My rules_ pane in the dashboard and see if there are rules for the "no-remote-fonts" switch. If so, remove them all to remove the blocking of fonts anywhere.

When blocking resources from a site, this may cause side effects on web pages, and it's probably what you are experiencing.

It is not clear why you think it is bad for the counter to "go up to over 1000" (??) It is a good thing - it means uBlock Origin + EasyPrivacy blocks the site (YouTube?

The only way to stop this is to create an exception filter to counter the filter in EasyPrivacy which blocks the network requests responsible for the counter forever going up. Use the logger to find out which filter is responsible for this, and counter it using a static filter, or a dynamic URL filter. See: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger The logger is the go-to tool when investigating uBlock Origin's behavior.

uBlock has access to the whole DOM of web pages (all blockers acting at DOM level do), so yes, it has access to that information. uBlock does not lookup that information though, its only purpose is to hide DOM elements which match cosmetic filters, or to collapse placeholders of blocked resources. Of interest: Privacy policy https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Privacy-policy
-------------------------
bypass
All blockers will cause your browser to warn you about "browsing history". This is not a new permission, this has always been in there since the beginning: no blocker can properly do its job without being able to access the URLs of all network requests. Chrome confuses user by making it sound like it is a new permission, but if you read carefully the warning, it just warns you about *all* permissions. The new required permission is "privacy", and it is used to allow uBlock to enhance privacy-sensitive options in the Settings pane in the dashboard: - to disable IP address leakage through WebRTC - to disable network pre-fetching (which bypass blockers) - to disable hyperlink auditing (which is used to track what you click)

I have checked what my virus scanner is blocking and there is nothing that appears to be ublock. however after the scan is completed and the relevant items quarantined the ublock logo changes to the default jigsaw puzzle and no longer works.

Are you blocking "t.co"? It's what Twitter uses when you click a link. With default settings, uBlock does not block "t.co", so you would have to look at what you changed in the settings which causes this.

I've been having trouble getting rid of one pesky ad that keeps coming back on yahoo mail. When I view my inbox there is an ad at the top that requires me to block the element every single time. It creates a blocking rule like ###yui_3_16_0_1_1433430560147_XXXX[href^="https://beap.gemini.yahoo.com/mbclk"] Where XXXX is a random 4 digit number every time I reload the page. Every other element on the inbox is also an element with a different random 3-4 digit number at the end. Is there any way to block this ad?

I switched to microblock because of promises of lower cpu overhead and no BS that is commonly found in other blocking extensions. This update pisses me off. I do not want you to protect me by disabling or enabling privacy settings. I can handle this on my own. Stop the B.S.
-------------------------
block
uBlock's primary purpose is to block **network connections**, not just data transfer. Not blocking the connection while just blocking the data transfer would mean uBlock is lying to users. So this permission will stay, and sorry for those who do not understand that it actually allows uBlock to do its intended job more thoroughly. A blocker which does not thoroughly prevent connections is not a real blocker.
-------------------------

uBlock Origin is an excellent ad-blocker, but new permissions have started configuring my browser for me, disabling network options "for your own protection", a concept in total contravention of its own manifesto that "uBlock's sole purpose is to give users the means to enforce their own choices." I would much prefer to have an option to still enable this setting.
-------------------------
block
> clearly contradictory to allowing users to enforce their own choices Not blocking completely while users ask uBlock to block IS contradictory to users' choice. I added a setting for next version to re-enable prefetching for those who do not mind the negative consequences privacy-wise.
-------------------------
block
uBlock emphasizes the privacy aspect of blocking, and a lot of users install it because of this. This setting is a requirement for uBlock to meet users' expectation that uBlock is protecting them privacy-wise.
-------------------------
block
It's for you own protection: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/0.9.8.2 If not disabling "Prefetch resources to load pages more quickly", your browser can still establish remote connection even for blocked network requests, hence your IP address could still be visible to these blocked remote servers. "Prefetch" enabled is a bad setting privacy-wise.
-------------------------

is there a way to allow popups generated from specific websites? If a whitelisted site opens a popup, uBlock prompts asking if I want to disable a specific filter (domain of the popup) but I didn't find a way to disable the blocking for ALL popups and ONLY IF it was generated from a whitelisted site.
-------------------------
block
@Raymond Hill Reading your response and the quick-guide I think I have a better understanding of how the strict blocking works. I must admit I didn't really consider the security part. As I live in south america I never get things blocked because of malware, but privacy/advertisement. For me uBlock/adblock is only a performance/convenience tool, and because of that I don't get many problems from allowing anything referred from whitelisted websites. Also, I wanted this mainly for bato.to where they recently implemented popups and indicated that they wouldn't work if using an ad blocker ( https://bato.to/forums/topic/22649-changed-ad-format-for-webtoonweb-comic-display-to-popups/). Given that bad ads there are removed quickly ( https://bato.to/forums/topic/18106-annoying-ads-v3/ ) I though there would be no problems whitelisting bato.to. I understand now tough that what I wanted does not seem feasible. Anyway, I thank you for your response and your work with the extension.
-------------------------
block
We need to clarify the terms here. When you say uBlock "prompts", you are certainly referring to strict blocking, which means you are navigating to a page which matches a filter. Popups are a different thing, uBlock never warns for popups. So I am going to guess you are asking if strict blocking can be disabled for when a blocked document is opened from a *specific site*. The answer is no, because that makes no sense to assume that all the links on a given site can all be trusted. I can't think of a scenario of where this would make sense. There is always a compromise between convenience and security, and in that case I won't compromise security for convenience, as I can't even think of a sensible scenario where this would make sense. All the sites in malware domain lists do not become suddenly all trustworthy because links to these malware sites sit on a site you trust.

I was wondering if it were possible to exempt certain plugins from being blocked - (specifically I'm interested in allowing PDF readers)? Thanks!

I have a workaround but it involves 4-5 clicks too often: - When on the site main pages - Disable/block JavaScript (by icon before 'www.') - When on the video page - Enable/Allow JavaScript (video pages on that site do not have the detection) I don't know which JavaScript function detects uBlock and is it possible to block/workaround this function somehow. You may also use other similar sites like: http://livetv.sx/ http://cricfree.tv/

uBlock Origin v0.9.7.0 / Chromium For help I read from here: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki/Logger "It is possible to click on the status indicator area to open the matrix for the associated tab (if any). The matrix will open in sticky mode" 1) Allow: * user to click in "the status indicator area" while uBlock 'pop-up' is opened to change the scope * Hot keys: Esc - close the 'sticky' uBlock 'pop-up' Space - Minimize/shrink the 'sticky' uBlock 'pop-up' More Hot keys: ` (backtick) - toggle show full/short URL 1 - toggle the 'funnel' (on/off the usage of filter) If possible - Maybe these Hot keys have to be user-selectable or at least give some hint which are they e.g. in some (?) icon 2) (maybe) After the filter type-box add drop-down to select (auto-type) most used filters e.g.: |-- (show only blocked) !|-- (show only NOT blocked) |bts (behind-the-scene) ... Recently used - the last 10-20 filters as typed by the user (by the way - "|bts" or "bts" do not work - it hides all (maybe not implemented in v0.9.7.0)) 3) Please return the drop-down (maybe at the right of [1000] box) to select a tab or behind-the-scene with default set to: "Show ALL events" (but user may prefer to set the default as was before: to the tab from where the Logger was opened) I usually monitor behind-the-scene after adding some new add-on to see "If an add-on constantly phone home" (I understand I give you too much to 'think about' but I hope you'll consider if any of the above worth your time to implement ;) )

You are offered the choice to disable permanently strict blocking for "www.googleleadservices.com" -- the "Permanently" button. So, just take the choice offered to you? If you take it, uBlock won't get in the way anymore for when you go to "www.googleleadservices.com".

That's not normal. You could try to purge EasyList, and force a new download of it: - Go to the "3rd-party filters" pane in the dashboard - Click the purge button aside EasyList - Click "Update now" If this does not work, You need to be sure that yo do not have custom settings/filters/rules that interfere with the proper functioning of uBlock. uBlock with out of the box settings does block ads on Youtube.

You exception filter should work fine if you pasted it to the "My rules" pane, not the "Whitelist" pane. The "Whitelist" pane is to completely disable uBlock on certain sites.

Tjhis happens only if you disallow popups using the "no popups" switch. See:<https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Manually-editing-per-site-switches#caveats>. > Chromium-based browsers: If you block popups everywhere by default (no-popups: * true), this will break "Open link in new tab" in the context menu.

There are hard limitations, due to space limits on sync account. Thing is, nothing prevent a user from cut-and-pasting MB of filters in their custom filters area, and this would cause the storage limit on sync accounts to be busted.

How can I block these kind of pop ups?onclickads.net
-------------------------
block
Ok, it's because the site is using a domain name which is not filtered by EasyList yet, so that popup doesn't get blocked. Try this custom filter (without quotes): "||ad132m.com^$popup" For popups to be blocked, there needs to exist a filter to block it. So when advertizers create new domain names for their popup, these new ones do not get blocked until a filter is added in EasyList. It's actually for this reason that the next version of uBlock will have a popup blocker which will block all popup unconditionally for a give site: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface#no-popups So that will take care of all this without waiting for EasyList.

uBlock all of a sudden is not blocking Twitch ads here
-------------------------
block
uBlock is more strict because more filter lists are selected by default. I looked into the issue for wistv.com, and indeed, an entry in the list "Peter Lowe's" was blocking a resource needed by the site for proper playback. To fix the issue, a new version of uBlock's own filters is available, and this should show in the "3rd-party filters" pane. If it doesn't show that there is a new version available, restart uBlock, then you should be able to see it, and update it. Another way is to un-select "Peter Lowe's", this will make uBlock less strict and closer to how ABP behaves.
-------------------------

The EasyList bundled with uBlock is certainly not outdated: > Last modified: 21 Mar 2015 12:20 UTC EasyPrivacy still has filters related to `googletagmanager.com`, and the Japanese filter lists blocks it completely, and also hpHosts.

I wish there was an option to have uBlock disabled by default but only active on sites that I choose when I notice especially intrusive ads. I basically want the extension turned on but the blocking turned off unless I choose to block on that particular site -- which I would then do by clicking the icon as I currently do to *disable* ads rather than having to go in and edit URLs by hand. It should be a streamlined experience.

As said on the front page of the project, uBlock is not an "ad blocker", so not everything which is blocked is an "ad". EasyPrivacy is enabled by default in uBlock. Because of EasyPrivacy, uBlock by default will also block trackers/analytics. When you play a Youtube video, there are recurrent network requests which are blocked because of filters in EasyPrivacy. If you use EasyPrivacy in Adblock Plus, you will get the same exact result.

"Whitelist" is to disable uBlock for a site.

I'll watch about 10 youtube videos in a row without refreshing the screen, and up in the corner the extension reads something outrageous like 345K requests blocked, is this normal?
-------------------------
block
Yes. The statistics will reset only when the root document changes. Nowadays, Youtube (and some other sites) do not fully load a page, they instead incrementally update pages. This means the statistics will stay. uBlock ships with EasyPrivacy enabled by default, and Youtube makes often requests which are blocked by EasyPrivacy, hence the count keeps going up. Probably the same would happen with another blocker with EasyPrivacy enabled.

uBlock uses 3rd-party filter lists, I don't maintain filter lists and don't have the time too -- or interests, I like to code as a hobby, maintaining filter lists looks quite tedious.

Ideally another developer which has an account with Hulu could investigate and contribute a solution to uBlock.

Since installing uBlock some websites are blocked and an OpenDNS "This domain is blocked" notice appears. I don't use OpenDNS. I don't know if all addresses in Chrome are resolved by OpenDNS, but it shouldn't use a different DNS than the system. And I don't want to block the domains it is currently blocking! How do I stop this? Btw, this is pretty major. This should be an off-by-default setting.

uBlock doesn't manipulate your network settings, it just blocks network requests which happens to match a filter.

Addenda: it appears that the blocked domain I tried to access is not included in any of the lists used by default by the extension, so it seems that Chrome really is using OpenDNS to resolve addresses. This is not right. If I want OpenDNS I will set it so.

I'm a big user of the StumbleUpon extension for Chrome, but I also want to block 3rd party scripts and iframes by default, however the way that the StumbleUpon extension works is by creating an iframe at the top of every page for their toolbar. I've whitelisted stumbleupon.com and a few other sites they use, but the toolbar is always blocked. How would I go about completely whitelisting the StumbleUpon iframe but blocking others? Thanks!
-------------------------
block
I see the problem. That sort of scenario is actually being addressed as part of Github issue #433, I have been working on this in the last few days, not sure when I deliver though. But this should definitely address your problem: it will be possible to override a broader dynamic filter (like "3rd-party iframes") with a narrower dynamic filter (like "don't block "stumbleupon.com").

Is there any way I can make the lists identical to ABP? This extension often blocks too much, and I get a lot of broken sites.

When I am watching a long video or keep watching a playlist in full screen without exiting on youtube, the blocking counter keeps increasing. I had times where it was at 700+... I also noticed that this is effecting the performance of the browser. For example, when stopping a video, it can take over 1 second for this to happen. I am very sorry for my bad English xD
-------------------------
block
It's normal, there is a filter in EasyPrivacy which blocks these Youtube net requests collecting stats which occurs at interval when playing a video on Youtube. The count on the badge is absolutely not detrimental to the browser performance, it just tells the truth about the number of net requests which were blocked. You can rest assured that whatever "1 second" delay you experience when you press stop, it's completely unrelated to uBlock, as uBlock *does not do anything special internally* when you press the stop button. If this still bother you, you can create an exception filter to override the EasyPrivacy filter in order for the requests to not be blocked: "@@||s.youtube.com^" (without the quotes). But my advice is keep the filter, it's part of EasyPrivacy for a reason. The number on the badge is for information purpose, whether the count is low or high has no bearing on uBlock's performance.
-------------------------
block
uBlock uses EasyList, EasyPrivacy, Fanboy Social Block by default. If you think it blocks too much, just un-select whatever list you do not want.
-------------------------
block
Please, take a look at the following sites. http://kissanime.com/ http://www.dramago.com/ Some banners do not get blocked and the custom filter does not work either.
-------------------------
block
I get same result with Adblock Plus, so it's a filter lists problem. EasyList et al. are third-party to uBlock, meaning someone else maintains these lists. You need to report to these maintainers the problem. Now regarding "custom filter does not work either", I checked and you are right. I found out that there are exception filters in EasyList to actually prevent them from being removed. This means your custom filters will be overriden by the exception in EasyList. Why these exceptions were created is something you will have to ask EasyList crew. However uBlock currently supports a filter option to prevent any exception from overriding a block filter: "important". So this works: ||kissanime.com/ads/sideskins/$important For http://www.dramago.com/, it's not clear to me what needs to be blocked, I don't see obvious ads, but it's likely a filter problems again, as often said, uBlock will behave same as ABP with exact *same* filter lists.
-------------------------
block
I noticed that the blocked ads counter steadily increases even after a page has loaded (at least on some pages, can't confirm if this happens on every site). For example I was watching a YouTube video that is over an hour long, and by the end of it the counter on the YouTube page was up to 264. Am I misunderstanding what this counter represents, or is this some sort of bug?
-------------------------
block
Any single net request which is blocked adds to the counter. You can confirm this by opening the developer console. Specifically in the case of Youtube, I see net requests regularly blocked while playing a video, net requests which URL starts with "https://s.youtube.com/api/stats/...". This happens because of a filter in EasyPrivacy: "||s.youtube.com^".

Is there a way to ask uBlock to show which sites it's blocking on a particular page? This would really help me in debugging why disqus won't work.

So I woke up today and uBlock is no longer blocking any ads. Idk why.
-------------------------
block
Strike that, blocking 3rd-party scripts doesn't fix the problem. So it has to be the two filters I gave you. I will notify EasyPrivacy maintainers so that they include the fix in the official list.
-------------------------
block
Suddenly out of nowhere ublock started to not working. Now it says 'request blocked on this page ?'. I tried reinstalling the chrome extension but that did not help.
-------------------------
block
How about you give me a test case which I can use to reproduce the problem you are reporting? One specific URL would be much more constructive. uBlock parses and enforces EasyList et al. If there exists no filter for a specific popup, it won't obviously block it, and this needs to be reported to the maintainers of EasyList.

Adblock for Chrome (not Plus) has the following options when I click its button: 1. Pause Adblock 2. Remove ads on this site 3. Create an exception for this site 4. Disable Adblock on domains of this site 5. Show removable elements 6. Reports ads on this site May I ask you to implement points 1-5? Currently you just offer an option to disable uBlock on a per-site basis. Adblock on the other hand gives us easy options to block specific elements using a GUI and disable it using wildcards and stuff. So I can block ads on www.domain.com, but can allow them on site.domain.com/user/* Very useful.
-------------------------
block
*** 1) Okay *** 2) Didn't see it, maybe change the icon. *** 3) It was faster to write 1-5 than 1-2 and 3-4. *** 4/5) The point is that Adblock directly shows how the site will look with certain elements (not) blocked. Thanks!

After using for quite a while, I saw some bugs. When opening Chrome there is a slight delay in blocking ads, often times it doesn't do it's job. The worst thing to do is to refresh the browser a few times to be able for it to remove the ads. I have observed this while browsing on Yahoo! website. Perhaps you can fix the said issues sooner. Thanks
-------------------------
block
Yes, this has been reported often times. Problem is the browser, by design, can't guarantee that extensions will be fully ready before loading tabs, i.e. extensions can't prevent the browser from loading tabs. So when uBlock launches, it has to load all filters etc, i.e. it needs to do a lot of work before being ready to block ads, but then the browser won't wait or even ask extensions whether they are ready before loading the tabs, it loads the tabs asap after launching the extensions. Improving load performance should help, and this was done with version 0.5.0.0+, which I wish to publish as soon as uBlock get out of "pending review" mode (I am currently not allowed to update it). From there, will see what else I can do to improve further load time, but still, this depends a lot on the amount of lists used, whether "Auto update" is selected, etc. As long as the browser opens tabs without waiting for extensions to be ready this is going to be a recurring problem.

I use OKCupid, and whenever you use any sort of extension that blocks ads, they put up this image with a message begging you to donate $5, and it takes up most of the right side of the screen. I imported a filter I used in AdBlock that blocked it, but those turds at OKCupid keep finding a way around it. Is there anything that you guys at uBlock can do to filter this out? It's a really bad eyesore, and it's advertising in my book that I have NEVER whitelisted.
-------------------------
block
You can check everything above Spam404. Spam404 and everything below is mostly Adblock Plus filtering, so if you disable ABP filtering, it's not very useful to load and parse these lists. There is no harm in having the same hosts-based lists selected in both uBlock and HTTPSB, except that selecting the malware domains lists in uBlock is probably overkill, as it is already very unlikely that these domains are going to be hit, and if ever it happens, HTTPSB does a better job at blocking these since it blocks the whole page from downloading, not just its secondary content.
-------------------------
block
Found a minor flaw with blocking specific elements on a page. Basically, if you have chrome to open a specific website when launched, it won't work properly until the webpage is refreshed. For example, let's say I blocked a sidebar in Facebook. Set chrome to open Facebook when launched and relaunch chrome. The sidebar won't be blocked until Facebook is refreshed.
-------------------------
prevent
That would be <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/108>. Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed fix for this one, the browser doesn't wait for extensions to fully load before opening a tab, by design. There might be extensions out there which purpose is to manage tabs, and maybe one of them has a feature to prevent tabs from opening at launch unless you ask for it. I could try to inject content scripts into existing pages, but that would address only the cosmetic filters part (assuming this works anyways). That's the most I can do, here I created an issue for this so you can follow progress: <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/129>
-------------------------

I've both AdBlock and uBlock installed. uBlock seems to shows a higher number of Ads blocked (on the icon) than AdBlock. But In reality it does not. Check http://abeyaustin.wordpress.com/2014/07/19/internet-is-truly-the-fastest-growing-mediumindustry-ever/#respond with uBlock enabled and disabled. You will find there will be no differences in the page but still uBlock shows it has disabled 5 ads.
-------------------------
block
It depends of the lists selected. EasyPrivacy, Peter Lowe's and known malware lists are enabled out of the box, so aside ads it also blocks trackers, analytics, malware domains.
-------------------------
block
So it blocks more than just ads? That's cool! Can you explain what else are blocked, if possible?
-------------------------
block
Ir reports properly. The count depends on number of items blocked, which itself depends on what lists are selected. For the link you provide, I see 8 requests blocked (uBlock is a generic blocker, not an "ad" blocker, I find the disctinction important). If you want to find out what was blocked, go to the Statistics tab, and enable logging of blocked requests. Than you will be able to see exactly what requests were blocked.

hi, if you set some webpage which contains ads as your home page in chrome or you will use "auto load last session" feature ads on that webpage aren't being blocked automatically by ublock you have to force refresh webpage so ublock will start to work... can you fix it or is it chrome's drawback?
-------------------------
block
It's a chromium-based browser issue: unfortunately there is no guarantee extensions will be up and running before page loads when launching the browser. Before uBlock can start blocking, it needs to load huge lists of filters, and this takes a while to complete, and the browser won't wait for an extension to finish whatever it's doing. It's by design in chromium.

Cons: Hides chat feature on some sites, prevents comments from posting on others, disables Facebook/Twitter login from functioning on some sites, prevents some apps from working on Facebook.

This extension is a two-sided coin. It is by far the best chrome extension I've used for comprehensively blocking all ads (even popups, chat box nonsense, etc).

DYNAMITE! This extension supremely exceeds my expectations. All I expected it to do when I first added it to my web browser was to just block annoying pop-ups but it also blocks my YouTube ads. Not only that, there is also a neat feature called "Block element..."! This may be TMI, but I had an assignment on Google Classroom from a previous semester which I wasn't satisfied with my grade, though my teacher would not let me redo it. Sometimes I would accidentally click on old assignments, and it the grade on that assignment still haunted me every time I saw it, even though it was from the past. I used the "Block element" feature to hide my grade and comments from my teacher on that specific assignment from my view. Bam! I don't have to see any unwanted negativity from the past. This extension is a MUST-HAVE! 😁

After a period of using it I ran into lots of false positives. I wasn't able to receive e-mails and messages on my computer but I could on my phone, and upon uninstalling uBlock I discovered it was because it blocked the scripts responsible for loading content. I've also observed it blocking CloudFlare CDNs, making some essential scripts not load. To leave a review I needed to turn off uBlock as it was blocking the ability to rate the extension.

Sometimes this would just... stop working. Specially after my computer does an update. Don't get me wrong it works, but it takes almost an hour for it to remember "Oh right I'm supposed to block things..."
So video ads get through, ads on other sites, pop-ups... it all gets through. Just sometimes it forgets "Oh right, I should actually start blocking things." like it just woke up and hasn't had it's boot up coffee.
When it works, it's solid! But when it doesn't work, like on boot up... it's why I'm giving it 3 stars.

Used for years without an issue, then within the last few months it's started failing. When Facebook got its new update, this extension was no longer able to block its ads. I assumed this extension would then just get an update to work with it, but it didn't. But then it also stopped being able to block all the ads on Tumblr for no reason, and THEN it stopped being able to block annoying popup ads on a site. Still works MOST of the time but I wish they'd patch this up.

Works same as before, but recent 'problem' is that my usual streaming site, which has harmless link that I can click for new tab to affiliate site, can no longer open new tabs from links. This seems to be result of stronger (?) popup blocking from ublock, but it is just an inconvenience now, I can't seem to whitelist the popup tabs either. Closes immediately as it opens. Please fix
-------------------------

It's good, it makes it easy to block/unblock sites, and seems to block most ads (though not all). That being said, I might like to see an enhancement regarding possible recommendations/ratings to block or unblock a site. Perhaps the blocker could detect what it blocked in terms of knowing what ad-supply sites in the page have bad reputations. I have it set to block all sites except the ones I manually whitelist. 

Case in point, just a few minutes ago I saw a pleasant message on tomsguide.com asking me to unblock them when I found an interesting article linked in a Google search, and I went ahead and did. I should have clicked "Continue reading with Ad Blocking," however, because I instantly got hit by a compromised ad that replaced the article with a full-screen red page saying my Chrome was infected and call Microsoft at "this number" and a pop-up dialog box, which we all know is one of those fake tech support things. I immediately closed the page. Running MalwareBytes and McAfee scans indicated I'm safe from anything that might have gotten downloaded without admin rights, however. 

So, moral to the story is, keep everything blocked using uBlock Origin unless it keeps a site from loading correctly at all. I acknowledge that "recommendations" could open the extension to problems (fake recommendations, or even ad companies paying to get good recommendations), as I believe led to the downfall of at least one previous popular ad blocker.

Only time I ever see ads is when I go to local restaurants and they have the TV on. Otherwise, I haven't seen a single ad since installing this. Plus, if you ever DO manage to see one, you can use the element picker to select the ad, then preview what the page would look like with that domain is like when that element is blocked. Pretty useful for not ONLY ads, but unwanted parts of pages. Example being the "Suggested Friends" popup on Facebook. If I wanted friends I would look for them, not let a site do it for me. Pretty easy to block it. Haven't had suggestions in a while.

I love Ublock Origin.  My husband told me about it and I started using it. then, I tried a different browser other than Chrome or Firefox and decided to try other ad block and ad popup extensions.  I can honestly say that none of the others work.  I still got popups, ads opening in new tabs and new windows.  Yet, This ap, Ublock Origin does not do that at all.  I was a fool for thinking that there was a better popup blocker out there.

I love being able to forget that YouTube has ads. And Spotify's web player.

Notable features: Element zapper (hold shift to keep using it), disable all blocking for the current site with one click (with complimentary reload button nearby), manual site blocking, premade lists for malicious and undesireable site blocking (sites such as ad redirects), easy options to disable said blocking temporarily (a few minutes) or permanently when encountering a blacklisted site.

I haven't used these, but it seems useful to have options to block "all popups," "large media elements" (i.e. autoplaying videos), and JavaScript (I'm afraid to know when you'd need that).

Just a heads up: this extension blocks some *not* popups. Notably on Canvass & other University related websites.

Use the Logger for X sites. And when you see an entry like "Popup" for the specific site, click on it, select Block, then click on Create to make a custom filter for that Popup. Also, the uBlock drop-down menu has a button that says "click to block popups on this site", click on it.

You really can't go wrong with this. Low resource usage, effective ad-blocking, and a little bit of security on top of it all, blocking dangerous popups from running on your browser. They offer an easy-access method of allowing certain ads as well, to support sources that you believe deserve them. Overall, just easy to use, effective, and very minimal in it's footprint for being so effective. It beats out every competitor, in every way.

Okay, so I never leave reviews, but I 100% felt the need to for this extension. I seriously made a Google+ profile (which I will probably never use again) just to write this. 

Before installing, my CPU was at 85-100%, which is what it typically is for me when I use chrome. After having it installed for, no joke, less than five minutes, my CPU went down to 8-15%. I'm so shook. 

Just to test it out, I went to kisscartoon (one of the worst websites for ads). With adblocker, you still get the occasional popup, but with this, there was NOTHING. Never got an ad once. 

Checked my CPU after watching an episode of South Park, and still was at 8-15%. 

never using adblocker again.

It's better than nothing  now that ABP is going to add ads of their choosing for a revenue source. I only moved back to ABP because it  handled pop-ups better,  the element blocker seemed to be much better. 

Here if I set an element to be blocked with wildcards(*), it is only for the session. If I come back or refresh the page, those elements get reloaded.

I wish they would block Facebook ads like Fluffybuster Purity does but FBP can slow down how any website can load because it reads your feeds much like how uBlock works and filters content. 

I can use the element blocker to hide a specific ad, but on page reload, the ad is back. So it's kinda pointless. 

That is where ABP shines. Elements blocked stay blocked regardless of how many times the page is reloaded, but where they pale is their ability to intercept pop-ups and pop-unders.

Relevant Popups are rarely blocked per default and this can be customized via settings.

Instead of slamming this guy w/ a low rating the first time a new ad-serve network is affecting you with pop-ups, why not try this.

Go into your subscription list, clear the cache there and then update your subs right after (yes even if you have auto update enabled)

Additionally, consider adding another subscription list that specifically deals w/ your issue, in this case pop-ups.

Thirdly, you could start adding new offenders / ad serving networks to your custom list and then share that info with your favorite list maintainer and help make the ad-block list volunteer community that much better.

Ever since Adblock became part of the "acceptable ads program" it has completely gone downhill. I don't mind seeing an ad here or there but after a few months the ads became incredibly invasive and obstructive. (obviously the point of me downloading adblock was to you know... block ads...) Becoming more and more frustrated I decided to try out uBlock. It is what adblock was and should have remained being. No ads, no fluff, no annoying popups or surveys or flashing lights on the side of your articles now. Say goodbye to the 3 minute ad you have to watch before viewing a 18 second clip on youtube. Do yourself a favor and uninstall the horse manure called adblock and switch to uBlock

UBlock Origin is currently the best overall set-it-and-forget-it ad blocker/general-purpose blocker browser extension with the lowest RAM and CPU usage in my opinion, and it is the only one that I have used so far that can block most annoying pop-up ads.

Just a request for the dev. This ad blocker is not working well with vipbox - a streaming website. There are still way too many ads and popups on that site.

These streaming websites are infested with all sorts of malicious ads and popups and a working ad block would be really helpful. Thanks.

I never get popups and malware and I replace AB with Ublock Origin a little over a year ago.

Doesnt work anymore. Went to bed and woke up with over 30 ads and pop-ups loaded when i woke.

This is probably the best. But still some ads and pop-ups that are not being blocked properly.

Is your issue related to Chrome's Material Design? There is an issue opened for this:

You can still access the dashboard by clicking the title bar in the popup panel.

The best blocker ever i have found till now. Never allows even pop-us or any site that that is not trustworthy and the best of all is it provides the option that allows the user to decide what they like and function accordingly. NOTHING CAN COMPARE UBLOCK ORIGIN IN BLOCKING ADS. My favorite is it asks my permission to let the site be on temporarily or permanent for pop-ups. no java script ads or popups also. in short IMPECCABLE
-------------------------
popup
The only popup blocker that I've tried that actually blocks popups. Thank you!
-------------------------
popup
It actually blocked most of the ads and popups. What happened recently though is that a malware software detected some very fishy items and they were linked to this extension and of course it was removed by the software. Not sure if I want to trust it again.
-------------------------
popup
this is just great! i pirate games and the sites have popups every time you click but with ublock origin, you can completely block them out. i've never seen an ad block this good
-------------------------
popup
It's too aggressive. I saw popup about site being blocked because of ads many times, and it was always false alarm.
Sometimes it blocked things like google analytics, which I noticed because I'm a developer, not sure if this is intended, but that's certainly not an ad.
The most amusing case was when it blocked a translation on Google translate....... (the word vulnerable)

Unusable.
-------------------------

Those ads originate not from your browser but from adware and malware in your own system. They are a type of computer virus and cause pop-ups like these. I would recommend you to acquire an antimalware for your system.

Of course you will see something like "Storage used: 15,249,140 bytes" depending on which lists you use (So you compare wrong: package size to "Storage used")
2) "the original uBlock" is just an old version from the same author (Raymond Hill)
3) None of them is Malware

I don't know what you mean by "pop-ups like 'google-analytic' one". Can you make a screenshot to help me understand what you are referring to?
-------------------------

What about content completely sponsored by ads? Are those ads intrusive? What about ads that you can skip, or ads tailored to your interests? Movie trailers, video game trailers, Twitch, youtube or most websites? It's unrealistic to have no ads, or you would never find out about anything. Most agencies are making better ads, ads that tell a story or are for a good cause; I agree all pop-up and misdirection ads are completely dumb, and pre-roll ads should be skippable if uninterested. But ads in general will always exists, it's how you find out about most things, get updates, and how many of my favorite sites and distrivutors market oa n audience and gain revenue. Only the Dark Side deals in absolutes.

On certain sites, when I clicked a link, an unwanted tab, with ads/videos would open. I'd have to quickly shut down the tab hoping nothing horrible was loading itself onto my Mac (unlikely, but has been known to happen). Fortunately my flash blocker would stop the videos from playing. But it was such a pain to have to deal with unsolicited popup tabs all the time. I have adblocker plus; adguard; ghostery; disconnect; flash blocker. They all do their jobs, but none would stop those tabs. Chrome privacy settings wouldn't stop them. They were driving me nuts . . . until I found uBlock. Worked right out of the gate, and works every time. Gotta love that. Thanks, Gorhill! BTW: I wouldn't pay a dime for products advertised in this manner, on principle alone! Why would anyone? Yet people must, because they keep using these abusive advertising technique, which they wouldn't do if they didn't work.

Chrome suddenly stopped working today, and I narrowed the problem down to uBlock. When disabled everything works fine. I guess I'll have to find something else.

Not able to block its popups!?
-------------------------

This is a very minor issue, but uBlock Origin is blocking the following pop-up prompt on YouTube: "The following content has been identified by the YouTube community as inappropriate or offensive to some audiences." *user must click the prompt: "I understand and wish to proceed." * It seems like the uBlock Origin extension thinks this scenario is a pop-up ad, when it is actually a YouTube user interface prompt. To get around this, I have to disable the extension. An example of this issue can be observed by trying to watch the following video on YouTube with uBlock Origin active: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moK9JVvbbZ0 However, this video is not the only case. This occurs with any YouTube video that automatically generates the explicit content prompt. Other than that, thank you so much for such an amazing browser extension!

Why is uBlock incapable of blocking the pdfwondershare.com site? As soon as I installed it, that site was the first one I put in. I get ads from them nearly every single day, have to either sit there and eventually wait for the pop-up to go away on its own, or click on it and then close the tab that comes up. Why?????
-------------------------

You shouldn't have poopups from that site all the time. Maybe you installed addware so it sends you those popups constantly. Try checking if you can uninstall it or maybe run antivirus/antimalvare program.

The .aspx pages are presumably either tables of content or text document replicas that, maybe, the uBlock extension does not detect as a webpage so it can block any pop-ups there. I'm not defending the developer by saying this, as it really needs work to sort this out, but rather trying to help you understand why it's not working there. Maybe they'll get it working in the near future.

With uBlock Origin or uMatrix 'enabled', inserting pictures in e-mails does not work. Everything works fine up to selecting the picture on the hard disk and loading it, i.e. the progress bar shows that the picture has been loaded, but then nothing happens any more. On the pop-up screen with the progress bar, the blue 'insert' button on the lower left remains faded out and the two gray bars in the lower right do not react. The same probably goes for other attachments that are handled by the same GUI dialogue. Disabling uBlock Origin and uMatrix, the normal behaviour is that when the uploading progress bar reaches the right side, i.e. when uploading is complete, the pop-up dialogue for inserting a picture (selecting it from the hard disk) will simply disappear and the picture shows up in the e-mail message that is being composed. Issues like these are what makes the use of security and privacy software so tedious. Has anybody ever thought of not blocking them and instead feed bogus info, so that privacy is not compromised but the web works as it is supposed to?

Dear Raymond Hill! I am very irritated by the strict blocking behavior of this extension. It makes absolutely zero difference for me whether the obtrusive pop-up, rudely interrupting what I'm doing at the moment is an advertisement, or a notification about a blocked advertisement. I installed this program to block pop-up windows, not to replace random pop-up windows with ones from this extension.
-------------------------
popup
Popup tabs/windows are blocked only when there is a matching popup filters. If you get the document-blocked tab/window, and it does not close itself, it's because there is no popup filters, you need to report to filter list maintainers so that they add a popup filter. Other blockers also require the popup filter, but in their case they would load the content instead of blocking it like uBO. TL;DR: report to filter list maintainers: https://forums.lanik.us/viewforum.php?f=62

Hi, I keep running into scenarios where uBlock Origin is blocking wanted actions, for example popups for legitimate sites. I get no warnings or notifications (that I can see), so it feels like I am just clicking a link and getting nothing. Is there a way to relax the restrictions whiteout whitelisting or entirely turning off blocking for a site, but still let wanted behaviors through? The latest example is from Huckberry which unfortunately is a member site and I don't expect you to sign up and see. The behavior happens on their referral link where a popup appears and you enter a friend's email to send them an email. Thanks.

Works fine here using default settings. This could be caused by: - You enabled one or more 3rd-party filter lists, and one of them contains a problematic filter. If so, report to the maintainers of the filter list. - You created a custom filter which causes this. Use the logger, it will tell you why the tab was closed. When a tab is closed by uBO, it is reported in the logger as a "popup" type, along with the filter which caused this. The logger is the first thing to look at to diagnose issues. The content 3rd-party filter lists or your own custom filters is outside the control of uBO.

Those inline popups are DOM-based, they are not created through a standard browser API, unlike the window-based popups. So the remedy needs to be on a per-case basis, i.e. each instance needs to be reported to filter list maintainers, and specific cosmetic filters need to be crafted to foil these inline popups.

@Raymond Hill Reading your response and the quick-guide I think I have a better understanding of how the strict blocking works. I must admit I didn't really consider the security part. As I live in south america I never get things blocked because of malware, but privacy/advertisement. For me uBlock/adblock is only a performance/convenience tool, and because of that I don't get many problems from allowing anything referred from whitelisted websites. Also, I wanted this mainly for bato.to where they recently implemented popups and indicated that they wouldn't work if using an ad blocker ( https://bato.to/forums/topic/22649-changed-ad-format-for-webtoonweb-comic-display-to-popups/). Given that bad ads there are removed quickly ( https://bato.to/forums/topic/18106-annoying-ads-v3/ ) I though there would be no problems whitelisting bato.to. I understand now tough that what I wanted does not seem feasible. Anyway, I thank you for your response and your work with the extension.
-------------------------

We need to clarify the terms here. When you say uBlock "prompts", you are certainly referring to strict blocking, which means you are navigating to a page which matches a filter. Popups are a different thing, uBlock never warns for popups. So I am going to guess you are asking if strict blocking can be disabled for when a blocked document is opened from a *specific site*. The answer is no, because that makes no sense to assume that all the links on a given site can all be trusted. I can't think of a scenario of where this would make sense. There is always a compromise between convenience and security, and in that case I won't compromise security for convenience, as I can't even think of a sensible scenario where this would make sense. All the sites in malware domain lists do not become suddenly all trustworthy because links to these malware sites sit on a site you trust.
-------------------------
popup
It's because the page opened is matching a filter in one of the filter lists, i.e. the page is seen as a popup (because "new tab"), and the popup matches a filter in one of the filter list. Report the issue to the maintainers of the filter lists (filter lists are 3rd-party to uBlock).
-------------------------
popup
I see a filter for popup from epicurious.com in the Japan filter list, same with slickdeals.net. So the issue is in the Japan filter list. Using a lot of filter lists raises the likelihood of web page breakage, so be careful about which filter list you pick. The next version of uBlock will offer an easier way to create workaround for this, but for now you will have to create exception filter manually to work around the issues. For the specific cases you mention, custom filters: @@||epicurious.com^$popup @@||slickdeals.net^$popup I did not try but I expect this should work.

uBlock Origin v0.9.7.0 / Chromium For help I read from here: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki/Logger "It is possible to click on the status indicator area to open the matrix for the associated tab (if any). The matrix will open in sticky mode" 1) Allow: * user to click in "the status indicator area" while uBlock 'pop-up' is opened to change the scope * Hot keys: Esc - close the 'sticky' uBlock 'pop-up' Space - Minimize/shrink the 'sticky' uBlock 'pop-up' More Hot keys: ` (backtick) - toggle show full/short URL 1 - toggle the 'funnel' (on/off the usage of filter) If possible - Maybe these Hot keys have to be user-selectable or at least give some hint which are they e.g. in some (?) icon 2) (maybe) After the filter type-box add drop-down to select (auto-type) most used filters e.g.: |-- (show only blocked) !|-- (show only NOT blocked) |bts (behind-the-scene) ... Recently used - the last 10-20 filters as typed by the user (by the way - "|bts" or "bts" do not work - it hides all (maybe not implemented in v0.9.7.0)) 3) Please return the drop-down (maybe at the right of [1000] box) to select a tab or behind-the-scene with default set to: "Show ALL events" (but user may prefer to set the default as was before: to the tab from where the Logger was opened) I usually monitor behind-the-scene after adding some new add-on to see "If an add-on constantly phone home" (I understand I give you too much to 'think about' but I hope you'll consider if any of the above worth your time to implement ;) )

Wow thanks for blocking absolutely the download popups for when you want to save a picture.

Not sure why but when I have this installed and attempt to right click open link in new window or in new tab it just prevents it as if its a popup. Is there an option that I need to change?
-------------------------
popup
Tjhis happens only if you disallow popups using the "no popups" switch. See:<https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Manually-editing-per-site-switches#caveats>. > Chromium-based browsers: If you block popups everywhere by default (no-popups: * true), this will break "Open link in new tab" in the context menu. This is because of Chrome API limitations

Suddenly my uBlock icon is gray and its popup window is mostly blank: see a screengrab here: i.imgur.com/cLpX3hi.png (options window is also empty). And it's not blocking ads. I tried disabling and re-enabling it - no change. uBlock v0.9.2.3 Chrome Version 40.0.2214.91 m on Windows 8.1 x64
-------------------------

Ok, it's because the site is using a domain name which is not filtered by EasyList yet, so that popup doesn't get blocked. Try this custom filter (without quotes): "||ad132m.com^$popup" For popups to be blocked, there needs to exist a filter to block it. So when advertizers create new domain names for their popup, these new ones do not get blocked until a filter is added in EasyList. It's actually for this reason that the next version of uBlock will have a popup blocker which will block all popup unconditionally for a give site: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface#no-popups So that will take care of all this without waiting for EasyList.

How about you give me a test case which I can use to reproduce the problem you are reporting? One specific URL would be much more constructive. uBlock parses and enforces EasyList et al. If there exists no filter for a specific popup, it won't obviously block it, and this needs to be reported to the maintainers of EasyList.

I've entered your suggestion in github: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/39 and https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/40.

One of my very important rule with this extension is to keep the popup minimalist so I will have to think hard to figure the best way to implement a global switch.

It's not perfect, it's best to have a backup adblocker but there's a reason I've kept this one for many years while the backup often changes. This is the toughest most reliable adblocker I've ever had, too tough for some as it can break some websites. It might not always catch all the ads but the manual blocking tool works great and the ads stay blocked. This extention with a supplementary kinder adblocker for those sites that can't take it has made being on the internet so much easier and less annoying

I've been using this extension for at least 5 years, and on it's own it's a must have, as it blocks so much AND allows for manual blocking of html stuff on any given website. But in conjunction with ABP, ads/pop-ups/malware potential are absolutely taken care of.

However, as of writing this, the extension appears to be broken for me on Chrome, where pages refuse to completely load, and I can't access or manage the extension on my toolbar other than disabling it (which fixed the issue completely). I hope this is an issue that not many other users are experiencing, and it gets fixed soon, because this extension is a godsent.

Edit: Just uninstalled it and reinstalled it, if you have this issue, this seems to fix it
-------------------------

Same thing happened to me after 1.43 was installed. One CPU core would get pinned to 100% and nothing would load just like you said. Disabling the extension would fix it, re-enabling would bring it back... so it was definitely uBlock.

Reinstalling the extension fixed the problem and I was able to restore my settings from the backup without issue. There must be something wrong with the update process.

Overall great but I don't like that it blocks Honey by default and it's hard to stop it unless you just turn it off. It gives me the option to add to whitelist, so I choose that and it opens a page with a bunch of code and no other instructions. I figure it's good to go and it's still blocking honey. Would be nice if it made it more clear on how to whitelist chrome addons.

The extension as of the present time, completely stopped working on Google Chrome across all tabs. This appears to be the result of an update gone wrong, with requests being blocked coming up with the number "?". Please fix this ASAP.

Update: This issue I was able to resolve by using Extensity to shut off all my extensions and turn them back on. This issue lasted for many hours even when the browser was closed until I did this.

Update 2: Been a couple years, this extension has worked wonders. The latest update adding a "block element in frame" is welcome and I hope it helps get those particularly hard-to-delete elements blocked. Very impressed with this extension, everything else is a very distant second place.

Update 3: Breaks the Brave browser to the point it cannot load any webpages. Tested and verified this specific extension when turned on and off multiple times was the only culprit, no other extension replicated the issue. That is completely asinine and needs to be fixed. Flat 1 star until resolved.

Better than Adblock Plus. ABP is great especially combined with a browser with built in adblocking, but it only goes so far, there are still some ads that can get through them such as ones built into video player clients (no other adblocking method I've tried has been able to stop them besides uBlock Origin). uBlock also blocks other ads too, but I was mostly concerned with trying to get the ads baked into video players to go away.

Why would you disable it on all sites? Wouldn't that be the same as just disabling the extension? Also it's blocking the ad requests before they happen so it will actually speeding up page loads rather than slowing them down.

It was perfect for years, but over the past year or so more and more functionality has disappeared. Ads are not blocked on Twitch AT ALL. I kept waiting hoping that this would eventually be fixed, but as I said it has been a long time and no changes. Additionally, more and more sites are detecting the app and refusing access to the site until you disable it, which obviously defeats the purpose of having it in the first place.

I hate to be that guy but this ad blocker isn't really the "Holy Grail of adblockers" that people have been championing for years. Sure it's independant, open-sourced and lightweight, and while that's great and all, uBlock is a bit too extreme when it comes to blocking. For years I had to put up with many websites not functioning properly (e.g. cannot submit form, some UI elements missing), and then I finally realize that it's due to uBlock, so I turn it off and the site functions perfectly.

In the description it says "think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using". Well... I hate to break it to you (and I hate to sound ungrateful), but I believe those people are the reasons why some sites do not function properly. There are probably way too many filters that go off as false positives, which unintentionally block UI elements that were actually important for the site to function. I took a look at those filter lists and it made my head dizzy so I'm probably not going to bother trying to figure out the culprit myself.

uBO works with minimal site breakage with default settings/lists -- nothing has changed about this. If you add more lists or further customize it beyond basic settings/filters/rules, it will likely break more stuff. Also, do not use content blockers along uBO, they will likely interfere negatively with uBO's built-in counter anti-blocker filters.

Filter list maintainers constantly work on filter lists to address filtering issues, if you have any, please report to them, this is how those issues are addressed for all blockers, not just uBO (which also depends on 3rd-party lists).

Something bad happened recently. While this extension can get bloated and heavy on resources, it had  some really good filter lists, those lists now have quasi corrupted the extension breaking a lot of functionality on many sites like on Twitter and many more. Often, it won't block many annoyances and ads like it did before. Furthermore, the option to disable WebRTC actually enables it and it doesn't do anything.You are forced to use another extension to block WebRTC — unbelievable. As a result, I am now solely using Adguard instead.Perhaps one day I might return to Ublock. However, I think this extension is going to become unsupported unless it becomes a paid model.

Edge has been amazing, and Chrome has been very very BAD! And I don't want to use Edge, even if it is Chromium.

So, I went to google, searched gif to mp4, took FOREVER!!! Even while it was still trying to load the results page, I opened edge, got the results, and started converting my gif before chrome loaded the results... I'm really getting mad at chrome. I've tried so many things to get chrome functioning and  working right, I disable the only extension I have and... What is wrong with uBlock Origin? is too many people using it now, it the server it gets it's addresses to compare to overloaded, too many and unoptimized list of address to look up? Why has uBlock Origin turned Chrome so bad?

3 Stars for years of awesome usage. took 2 for whatever is wrong... I'm looking for the installation folder, maybe years and years of address cache has turned it bad, idk...

Sometimes this would just... stop working. Specially after my computer does an update. Don't get me wrong it works, but it takes almost an hour for it to remember "Oh right I'm supposed to block things..."
So video ads get through, ads on other sites, pop-ups... it all gets through. Just sometimes it forgets "Oh right, I should actually start blocking things." like it just woke up and hasn't had it's boot up coffee.
When it works, it's solid! But when it doesn't work, like on boot up... it's why I'm giving it 3 stars.

Has always done me good, but like many others it has recently stopped working on Twitch. I would not blame this on the devs of uBlock Origin because Twitch just rolled out an update to the ads that has them actually playing through the stream.

It's been a faithful companion on any browser I use for years. Unfortunately, it seemed to stop blocking ads on recipe sites. I know, makes me sound like a boomer, but since I use my chromebook as my recipe book... it's kinda annoying. These recipe sites not only make you scroll through a mountain of crappy dialogue about the recipe before the actual instructions itself, but now I gotta see completely ridiculous ads? Boo!

Other than that, I'll never use any other adblocker. I can't trust a site that asks me to turn it off; between them and Ublock, I"ll chose ublock every time.

Used for years without an issue, then within the last few months it's started failing. When Facebook got its new update, this extension was no longer able to block its ads. I assumed this extension would then just get an update to work with it, but it didn't.

Still works MOST of the time but I wish they'd patch this up.

I love this: chrome/google hates this program.  This stops 99% of all ads.  If you notice chrome not allowing you to use this extension.  Try removing chrome and reinstalling if this doesn't fix it. I would suggest mozilla or some other browser that this extension supports.  PLEASE donate to the coder who made this extension for you.  Don't be on of those types of people that want everything for free when everyone can donate at least 1 USD, 1 EURO, or 1 of any other type of currency.

Recently, this extension decided to remove easy access to greening/allowing rules which makes this extension extremely annoying to use when the filter set used is overeager to block sites. It's terribly user unfriendly. I shouldn't have to hunt through custom settings to restore a feature that should have been there to begin with.

I really liked this extension as it has worked flawless for years.  But, as of this week, or last, can't remember, it has become a turd.  I can't go to any website without having to disable it for the website to work.  Most websites come up as just text until I disable it, Youtube won't even load until I disable, and I am left having to hope or go to another blocker.

it was working just fine until the last update which removed the option the allow pages local and all. without that feature its now worthless as it breaks every page that I haven't been to before.

Not sure why this isn't more popular. It's by far the most through blocker I've used and handles YouTube as well. Where as many others allow ads to load and tries to hide them away, this seems to negate them loading altogether. It can be a little overpowered on rare occasion, but can easily be toggled off or sites added to a Whitelist.

Completely stopped working. Any website, all websites, nothing but ads all over the place. They clearly gave up because it has not been fixed or updated in over a month. Dead plugin, don't install.

this is the first ad blocker app and/or extention ive ever used and ive tried them all the way backto my 386 with a 280 (something) baud modem! does exactly what it claims and even some more too. Since i added it i really have not seen even 1 youtube ad exept for the ones in the actual vids done by the channel themselves (like for skill share, mubi, or of course RAID SHADOW LEGEND or fn wikibuy! but not one previd or even the random inside the video ones either. Not only that but if you are familiar  fmovies or putlocker or 123movies etc, you will know the way those sites make you click ads 3-5 times one after the lother over and over again till they finally stop to start a movie and then at least 1 more to change volume and 1 to click full screen too, well i havnt had to click even one. seriously it goes straight into EVERY VID!!! i cant say enough how well this works. and i Am a real person. i mean look at my spelling. a app developer or a review bot would spell better than me. unless i was programmed to spell incorrectly to seem real. wait ... am i real. i dont actually rember my mom or my brothers. just hazy implanted memories???but, i feel real! i dont know now oh well either way, this shiz really works a 5...out of 5

bug
Fantastic extension, but there is a BUG and a missing feature.
The bug is that the "Block media elements larger than" does not always work on Chrome; this is 100% true.  To help debug or work around an unknown Chrome bug (not present in firefox), it does work in combination with the extension block image, and yes as you guessed it, the perpetrator that wasn't being blocked is images.  The image block chrome extension interestingly does not work by itself, but it does work with ublock when the block media option is used.  I don't like the terminology used.  It could "block" prior to download or after download.  Which is why you either need to rename or implement the feature "Do not download  media elements larger than", and you can use the extension image block to extend it to other media elements.  

  This problem is absent on Firefox.  The missing feature that I want is "

Has been amazing since I downloaded it, but recently I've been getting playback errors whenever I clock on a Youtube video and have too refresh the page for it to load. I tried everything and nothing worked, until I turned off uBlock and then the playback error never appeared again. Great app but it seems like there's a playback issue with Youtube right now.
-------------------------
error
I am also experiencing this error when on YouTube.  I either wait for several seconds for the video to attempt to load again, or I must refresh the web page.  This has been an issue for a couple weeks for me both on the current version of Chrome (Version 81.0.4044.92 (Official Build) (64-bit)) and the previous version.

It's breaking several sites, with page elements not loading, or undergoing perpetual reloading loops. I've had to disable it

for some reason, the ublock making it unable to view photos from facebook photo viewer, it always ended up reloading loop.
i hope it getting fixed soon

Starting to have issues with YouTube, along with others I know having the same issue. Getting a ton of playback errors with uBlock Origin installed, when it's completely uninstalled the errors are gone and never happen. Clearly an issue with uBlock Origin, and YouTube being YouTube with selective rollouts. I've also heard reports of ads getting entirely through uBlock Origin now, so best of luck.

Recently I've noticed that it's causing a playback error on youtube. I think something has changed with youtube that is causing it, with the blocker disabled, ads play on youtube but the error doesn't happen. I've removed and readded the extension to see if it's just my end but apparently not. 

Not sure what's happening either with the ads / youtube / the extension causing the error.
-------------------------
break
This is also happening with other ad blockers and extensions. The error is appearing with the Adblocker Plus and HTTPS Everywhere extensions for example and it also occurs on Firefox so it's not just chrome. It appears that YouTube has made a change that breaks some extensions. Either YouTube will fix their issues (very unlikely) or these extension providers will have to find a workaround.

Love this extension, it works good, but currently it is causing playback error messages on Youtube. Disabling UBlock Origin restores functionality.

UBlock Origin has worked great for me for years,  but there is a recent problem (Feb-Mar 2020) with UBlock (and some other reported Adblockers) and Youtube. Clicking on videos with UBlock Origin enabled causes an error in the player "An Error Occurred. Please try again later. (Playback ID xxxxxxx)" Using it with Win 10 and Chrome updated to latest.

Would give 5 stars, but currently getting issues with youtube videos, most times when I start a video Youtube I get a playback error, refreshing the page again usually fixes the issue.

Have been using this extension for a couple of years now with no problem but recently (about 3 or 4 days ago) whenever I start a video Youtube I get a playback error.

Ublock origin prevented this attack from occurring to which I am deeply grateful.

Also, if you're using Google Chrome, use the Brave browser or equivalent instead.

After uBlock Origin superseded Adblock Plus on my computers for almost a year now I almost forgot what ads were....until today 12/3/2019 when I noticed terribly slow browser performance when using Google Chrome. Not sure if there was an update/change.

I honestly thought it was an issue with my internet/router at first but after a few test I can confirm the issue lies with the extension. Symptoms I am experiencing are extremely slow page loads no matter the website. This especially happens when using incognito mode and will at time's cause the browser to become unresponsive when trying to change uBlock Origin's extension settings when it is enabled. Issue disappear's after disabling the uBlock Origin extension.

As with everything in life, I get hiccups can happen but uBlock Origin is definitely a cut above the rest. Hope this get's fixed soon so I can continue to enjoy no ad/pop up life once again! Thanks for what you do!

It's good, it makes it easy to block/unblock sites, and seems to block most ads (though not all). That being said, I might like to see an enhancement regarding possible recommendations/ratings to block or unblock a site. Perhaps the blocker could detect what it blocked in terms of knowing what ad-supply sites in the page have bad reputations. I have it set to block all sites except the ones I manually whitelist. 

Case in point, just a few minutes ago I saw a pleasant message on tomsguide.com asking me to unblock them when I found an interesting article linked in a Google search, and I went ahead and did. I should have clicked "Continue reading with Ad Blocking," however, because I instantly got hit by a compromised ad that replaced the article with a full-screen red page saying my Chrome was infected and call Microsoft at "this number" and a pop-up dialog box, which we all know is one of those fake tech support things. I immediately closed the page. Running MalwareBytes and McAfee scans indicated I'm safe from anything that might have gotten downloaded without admin rights, however. 

So, moral to the story is, keep everything blocked using uBlock Origin unless it keeps a site from loading correctly at all. I acknowledge that "recommendations" could open the extension to problems (fake recommendations, or even ad companies paying to get good recommendations), as I believe led to the downfall of at least one previous popular ad blocker.

This adblocker causes the infamous "broken back button" bug. Certain websites require me to hit back 4-5x to actually go back, & right clicking the back button shows many of the same page. This only happens with uBlock Origin Installed.

I love being able to forget that YouTube has ads. And Spotify's web player.

Notable features: Element zapper (hold shift to keep using it), disable all blocking for the current site with one click (with complimentary reload button nearby), manual site blocking, premade lists for malicious and undesireable site blocking (sites such as ad redirects), easy options to disable said blocking temporarily (a few minutes) or permanently when encountering a blacklisted site.

I haven't used these, but it seems useful to have options to block "all popups," "large media elements" (i.e. autoplaying videos), and JavaScript (I'm afraid to know when you'd need that).

By now a lot better than ABP. Takes less time to load and there's practically no site targeting it.

News media have gotten stupid, I won't watch the news on line any more.. but I need my music!!

GONE!!!  feels like freedom..  no more sex ads, and I visited a new site and was surprised, no ads.. 

Remember, I'm ok with ads, just give me a way to stop the ones that offend me and don't give me 80% ads to 20% news..

Typically quite great. Beats AdBlock, that's for sure. Unfortunately, like today, it is often out-of-date and you need to wait for it to get updated while you suffer through a day's worth of ads.

It's not so bad since it does its job well once it's properly patched, but being tossed back into the world of crappy ads really doesn't do you any favors.

EDIT: It has been like two weeks since the program stopped working. That's too long and I'm tired of targeted ads spying on me.

After having this ad blocker on for a number of months, I've decided to delete it. I actually find that it blocks too much stuff. As a result, web pages often don't display properly. This means I have to turn it off for the site, making all the ads populate the page. It also has a tendency to block me from accessing pages when I click on ads from my email, the only ads I actually want to interact with. Sure, I can continue on to the page by overriding it, but sometimes that takes a number of clicks. I feel like this blocker gets in the way more than it helps, compared to other options. I will say that the one time I watched Hulu in my browser, I liked that it blocked their ads. But I very rarely use a computer for that service, so it just doesn't fit my needs.

TL;DR: Enable more filters https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters

Are you using the Picker to select ads? Ads might have unique properties (generated on every page load), in this case you'd need to use regular expression to describe them. Or better yet, use additional filter written by someone external to uBlock Origin (third-party filter) -- see link above.

It's better than nothing  now that ABP is going to add ads of their choosing for a revenue source. I only moved back to ABP because it  handled pop-ups better,  the element blocker seemed to be much better. 

Here if I set an element to be blocked with wildcards(*), it is only for the session. If I come back or refresh the page, those elements get reloaded.

I wish they would block Facebook ads like Fluffybuster Purity does but FBP can slow down how any website can load because it reads your feeds much like how uBlock works and filters content. 

I can use the element blocker to hide a specific ad, but on page reload, the ad is back. So it's kinda pointless. 

That is where ABP shines. Elements blocked stay blocked regardless of how many times the page is reloaded, but where they pale is their ability to intercept pop-ups and pop-unders.

Relevant Popups are rarely blocked per default and this can be customized via settings.

It started out to be a great ad blocker, but then it started blocking too many legitimate pieces of code. Especially on e-commerce websites where it might block certain javascript code blocks which cause pieces of the pages to act unexpectedly or not work at all due to missing javascript and swallowed script errors. I removed this and will just deal with ads instead.

I'm having this problem as well, but a quick workaround for now is to:

1) Grab the extension's source with "Chrome extension source viewer" from the web store
2) Extract it all to a directory somewhere
3) Delete the _metadata folder
4) Open up Chrome's extension window and enable developer mode
5) Click on "Load unapacked extension", and browse to where you extracted it

Should be good to go. Works for me, where directly from the web store doesn't!

Nothing wrong with web developers making money, But banners and video ads etc are simply annoying and need to die out. My bandwidth is better spent on loading relevant content instead of making money for some developer that only wrote click-bait to lure me for advertising purposes. I might be stingy on bandwidth but when you have satellite internet which is slow and limited you would understand.

Works perfectly with the Ublock origin extra extension. Works very well for 99.9% of the sites I visit. I absolutely hated the ad bombs that news sites put up.

Even adblock didn't work on news sites as well as many others. ublock origin is the real deal and I'll be donating to them once I get more funds.
-------------------------
error
Great add blocker.

Throws an error in the console on some svgs and gifs on various sites, but specifically the site I do development for so every time the page loads there's an error in the console. 

Line 90 of contentscript.js of uBlock:
"if ( typeof vAPI !== 'object' ) {
    throw new Error('uBlock Origin: aborting content scripts for ' + window.location);
}"

Tried everything to prevent the error from being thrown -- even if uBlock is turned off for the site and the site is white listed it still 
throws the error.

Pretty trivial but annoying enough for me to switch back to ABP.
-------------------------
bug
I really like this extension, I use it along with uMatrix for safe browsing. 
 
A few additional features would earn it 5 stars from me. 

* White list a YouTube channel (I understand this isn't easy to do). 

* The buttons at the bottom to block Fonts, Cosmetic filtering, etc are a bit confusing, they're set up weird and it bugs me. So if I want to just block all that junk on a site, instead of them all having an "X" through the icon, they're instead inconsistent. Like, blocking Fonts has an X through it, but cosmetic filtering doesn't, and as for the other 2, I have no idea if they're turned on or not without testing it or looking through the options.  

I understand why its set up like that, I get it. But I just think it's a slightly bad design choice for those 4 buttons. 

Minor grumbles really. 

Best Ad blocker I've used so far.

Great add blocker, has stopped working on open.spotify.com, so will update to 5 stars when that is fixed.

In short: Uses less resources than others with only one fixable issue.

Discovered this extension from Reddit and it uses a lot less memory than Adblock(the non Plus version) extension I was using for years. The only issue I have had with it in the past few weeks is that I have to manually purge and update all filters/lists every so often because most images or items on websites will not load. For example, no images on Amazon would load when searching for items, on Facebook I couldn't open comment replies, and on YouTube when I couldn't open "Show More" under the "Recommended" section.
-------------------------
stop
yeah, stopped working on facebooks suggested ads today.
-------------------------

This is easily the best ad blocker I have ever used.  I had trouble with Adblock and Adblock Plus getting it to block Zergnet ads (Outbrain/Taboola like) which apparently are acceptable ads. Not for me, i wont be forced to load click bait in areas of a page where I want to scroll. uBlock eliminated these ads and unblocking useful elements on a page was as easy as clicking next to the url and making the line green.
-------------------------
load
Ads are showing up briefly when pages first load up, and uBlock Origin's filters only kick in 10 seconds afterwards. Happens on reddit a lot.  Also takes around 5 seconds longer than usual to load the extension from the Chrome menu. None of this occurs on Firefox, only Chrome.
-------------------------

Update: Error message reported a conflict with the Disconnect extension. After disabling Disconnect, uBlock has returned to its old reliable self.

Used the addon for the longest time and it worked great.

However, recently it has been preventing pages from loading at all. Makes me think it is my internet, but when I disable Ublock, it starts working..... This happens on ALL my PCs now, with this addon.

Not sure what happened, but it isn't what it used to be.
-------------------------

uBlock Origin is incredibly effective at blocking ads. The most effective I have tried.

Unfortunately it is too aggressive with default settings.  It blocks  everything and will prevent many web services (like gmail) from working properly - and you won't quite know why unless you are cognisant of uBlock running in the background.

Ghostery is better at blocking ads without breaking services.
-------------------------
break
By default it blocks tracking and other things that is needed for websites to work, and many times I have to disable it to have website work.  That even included opening the payment page for my utility (electric) company.  The default should be blocking Ads only, while giving the user the option to block other items if they chose to.  Its default to blocking everything breaks many websites, and is terrible since I continuously have to disable it for websites that I need to use in order to use them.

This app blocks a lot of useful functionalities of many site. After installing uBlock a lot of sites will have very strange errors. One example was Youtube stopped remembering where I left off on videos. So when I resumed to a video at a later time, it no longer played from where I last left off.

It also makes many other sites unusable.

I LOVED uBlock and it all of a sudden stopped working.  My browser is up to date. If i press the uBlock Origin logo on my chrome menu bar nothing happens.  It used to open a menu that showed me options about what ads were being blocked etc but now it's not working at all. I'm upset because I was much happier with this extension than my previsou adblocker but it is giving me zero functionality now.

I have the exact same problem with ABP. No longer blocks ads. Can't open the options menu. When I uninstall and reinstall it works for a few days but then breaks again. Was coming to get uBlock to solve the problem. Guess it's an issue with Chrome and not with ABP/uBlock.

Slim down all the crap your browser is told to download by the sites you're visiting. Great for users more comfortable tweaking settings as well as those who just want a cleaner surfing experience. 

For those in the latter category: be prepared for more interaction with your browser as you may find videos, images, comment sections, etc., not loading like you're accustomed to. 

Once you learn the ad block way, you can never go back. 

Want to support sites by allowing ads? Whitelist them.

Block Google Tag Manager, which is stupid as it stops EVERYTHING on a website from working
-------------------------
break
Your Google profile says: "eCommerce Technology Executive". Is it the real reason you think blocking Google Tag Manager ("BTM") is bad?

In any case, you are wrong, blocking GTM does not "stop EVERYTHING" from working in uBO, because uBO uses a replacement, neutered script which replace the GTM API with functions which do nothing. Things would break only if it blocked GTM without replacing it with a dummy API.

Ghostery does the same thing if I am not mistaken.

Just spell out the details of what "doesn't  work", somebody will probably be able to help. Here is a list of reasons of why blocking an image may not work:

https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Element-picker#the-removed-element-reappear-when-you-reload-the-page

- The URL or selector for the blocked element has variable part(s) in it, which changes each time a page is loaded.

- Cosmetic filtering is disabled for the site, or globally.

- You un-checked My filters in the 3rd-party filters pane in the dashboard.

- There is a static filter in one of the 3rd-party filter lists in use which counters your filter.

This ad blocker was written for geeks. The average person shouldn't have to hand-code rules in order for the thing to function as expected. I, too, had entire sites blocked. Other places I frequent, like Southwest.com, had the entire background and header image stripped. Yes, I know I could go up and click the big power button to stop blocking ads on southwest.com, but that's stupid. As sell-out as Adblock has become, at least it still did a good job of blocking ads. Quite honestly, I hadn't even noticed any performance difference between it and uBlock Origin. I've considered going back to Adblock a few times since installing uBlock Origin but because a good friend recommended it to me, I keep on trying to give it a chance. Only a few more fuck-ups left where it blocks the entire site or large portions of it, before I throw it in the trash.

I used this for about 24 hours after someone recommended "ublock" instead of my former addblocker.
Seeing as this one had more reviews and a higher rating than ublock itself I installed this.

What a mistake that was.
In those 24 hours the CPU fans did not stop spinning.
I actually had to close the (normally quiet) laptop on my desk in the bedroom to get some sleep.
As soon as I disabled ublock origin the CPU temperature dropped by about 20˚C.

One minor grip. It causes endless loading on some smaller sites. "Waiting for SMALLERSITE.net..." On the other hand, the usual 1-5 second delay in loading (Adblock) is gone so I can't really complain.

Had to be disabled on virtually every online shopping site I visit--I couldn't figure out why the sites were suddenly breaking, then would see that uBlock Origin had tons of blocks on sites that weren't displaying ads, except I guess for their own products.

For all That downvoted this because of the new Permissions.... READ THE BLOG!!!

uBlock now requires a new permission, "Change your privacy-related settings": for uBlock to be able to disable the setting "Prefetch resources to load pages more quickly".
This will ensure no connection is opened at all for blocked requests: It's for your own protection privacy-wise.

Significantly reduced memory usage vs ABP even with many more filters enabled.  Reduced CPU usage, reduced load times.

Do you people even read? If you did, you would know what the new permissions are for. Stop whining before you do a little research.

Ugly looking icon?  I think not.  I like the new icon.  It's about time.  The old one looked just like the adblock stop sign.  I'm sticking with this origin version since it is run by the original author.

Keep up the good work Mr. Hill.  Your work, dedication and passion on this program are appreciated.

On certain sites, when I clicked a link, an unwanted tab, with ads/videos would open. I'd have to quickly shut down the tab hoping nothing horrible was loading itself onto my Mac (unlikely, but has been known to happen). Fortunately my flash blocker would stop the videos from playing. But it was such a pain to have to deal with unsolicited popup tabs all the time. I have adblocker plus; adguard; ghostery; disconnect; flash blocker. They all do their jobs, but none would stop those tabs. Chrome privacy settings wouldn't stop them. They were driving me nuts . . . until I found uBlock. Worked right out of the gate, and works every time. Gotta love that. Thanks, Gorhill! BTW: I wouldn't pay a dime for products advertised in this manner, on principle alone! Why would anyone? Yet people must, because they keep using these abusive advertising technique, which they wouldn't do if they didn't work.

Works really well and blocks all of the ads on all the websites I browse. Certain poorly written websites will break when ads are removed - in those cases you can tweak the blocking rules until it works, or just disable uBlock for that website entirely. Don't use Chrome without this extension!

I'd give it five stars, but that stupid OKCupid image with the message begging you to donate them $5 because you're using an ad blocking extension (in this case, uBlock) has come back up.

Chrome suddenly stopped working today, and I narrowed the problem down to uBlock. When disabled everything works fine. I guess I'll have to find something else.

Its been happening to me, too. On both YouTube and Twitch. You can easily work around it on YouTube: as soon as the player loads, it shows you how long the video about to be played is, and ads are never long. Just keep an eye at the bottom of the player, you'll see two time tags separated by a "/" symbol. If you're about to watch an in-depth review of a new game, and the right tag says "0:22" or something, just hit refresh or F5 and the add will disappear. Doesn't work on Twitch, though. There was a specific blocker for the site, skipped ads by quickly changing video resolution repeatedly when an ad was detected. It's been banned from the Web Store. Guess I'll just have to find a mini-hobby to entertain myself while they are running, because they show up to 6 ads in a row, each up to 90 seconds long. I'm unemployed and insomniac, for crying out loud, I waste enough time as it is!

My Google Chrome Crashed and my extensions are bad.

I cannot get it from "my-ublock-backup_2021-11-16_06.58.22.txt" Since it does not have it in there, the only way is manually going into the Working Directory of cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm, but I don't know how your extension is coded, I don't know anything about it only the fact of where the extension installed which is in the DEFAULT/EXTENSIONS/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm So my question to you is where in the working files do I need to go? I need the file name of where Ublock stores any URL information for Custom Imported Scripts There is no option to export or import the Filter Lists, the only way to restore and save that data is via the Settings restore from File / back up from file button. Windows 7 has all the cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm data stored in the Shadowcache which I have access to so I have multiple backups of 'Default' profile. So would cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm folder contain the USER Entered data as well? or do I need to go into another working directory of Google Chrome? If so please let me know which directories I should be looking into to find this data. Kind thanks, EJ

After the above link loaded, I couldn’t go back by clicking the back button. I could still go back by long clicking the back button and selecting the desired link. I disabled all other extensions, except ublock origin, and the problem was still there. This problem disappears when disabling “uBlock filters – Privacy” filter. Best regards, Nick.

I tend to leave Google's search results page unfiltered, and whitelisted. However, in the last few days (seemingly after the recent update) it has been causing an issue with their snippets feature. It also seems to cause issues that whatever link was at the top. If that top link was amazon, then whatever I clicked on down the way would go to that link instead. That seems to have gone away, but now everything is disregarding margins and fully extends to the left and ride side creating an ugly display. It stops having this issue when I disable the extension, but the moment I re-enable it...it breaks again.

I started having this issue this morning 12/3/2021 where my usual websites wouldnt load and I thought it was internet connection but was not the case. The websites I could not load on chrome works on edge so I looked into this and one support comment suggested it could be an extension. I turned of all my extensions enabling them one by one and it was working fine until uBlock Origin was enabled now it would infinitely load once again. Ive been using this extension for years now and this the first I had a problem with it. Hopefully you can figure out the cause.

preface; as others have mentioned, understood that vivaldi isn't really supported. this is more informational than a request for support. with uB-O enabled on yt, every so often now, it will now crash all actively loaded YT tabs, not just the active one. spent some time tracking this down. with everything else enabled and just uB-O disabled for YT, no more tab crashing. so i don't know if this translates over to Chrome. my guess is yt changed enough of the code to break something. disclaimer; i'm also running 'adblock for youtube(tm)', a combo that has worked perfectly for years. running this alone works fine, but i still get ~<1s of the ad. with both enabled prior to the tab crashing, i never saw anything inserted into streams, just the video i wanted to watch.
-------------------------
stop
I know uBlock is not officially for Vivaldi but I thought I'd report it anyway in case you're interested in supporting it. uBlock has worked absolutely fine with Vivaldi except for one strange thing. I recently bought a KVM switch (StarTech.com SVDDDUA2) and whenever I switch between computers Vivaldi's front end on KDE (haven't tested Gnome) freezes completely, except for any videos that may be playing, I can stop and start those videos but once they're complete that part freezes too. The other computer, running Windows 10, is not affected. If I turn uBlock off then Vivaldi works just fine with me switching from one computer to another. I don't see the same behaviour in Chrome at all so it's most likely to do with Vivaldi but I figured I should report to both, just in case.

Dear developer, I am trying to register on a site I previously blocked to login and make a comment but disabling uBlock Origin does not help.

Hi, The zap function is only there to quickly remove pesky annoyances, this is just a temporarily removal. So yes, when you reload the page the elements you removed will return. If obliterating the pesky elements with your trusty zap gun isn't satisfying enough, I would recommend looking into if you are able to remove them permanently. As I am not familiar with what or where you are removing elements, I'm not sure how you can do this exactly. :) But I would start by.. looking in the uBlock logger and try to single out the element you that is annoying you and add a rule to block it. (I would of course test this afterwards to check that you haven't blocked something important. That then would refuse the web page to function properly.) *I'm not the developer of uBlock, just a random dude on the interwebs*

bug
uBlock origin sometimes causes the tab I'm using to disappear when I click a link to navigate. Not crash, disappear. This has been going on for quite a while, but I recently discovered a 100% reliable way to reproduce the issue so I can report it. What's weird about this set of circumstances is it's really not obvious how the site could be "at fault", since the tab that closes is unrelated to the tab that was running uBlock Origin. Repro steps: 1. Navigate to https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/news/how-birds-of-prey-is-building-gothams-future/ar-AAI7OVn 2. Select the text "Birds of Prey(and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)." 3. Right click -> Search Google for "Birds of Prey..." 4. In the new tab, click on the first youtube link. RESULT: the tab closes without warning, bringing you back to msn.com. This issue does not reproduce if uBlock origin is disabled on msn, but it does still reproduce if it was enabled on msn but disabled on google. That's super weird, because msn wasn't responsible for launching google.com, the browser was, so msn couldn't be responsible for closing it. My best guess, therefore, is this is a bug in uBlock Origin itself.

Hi, I appreciate this extension ALOT. Thank you. Is there a way to run uBlock OFF by default? As a webdev, sometimes I need to disable uBlock and it's a pain in the butt to manually do it every time I load a new page. Sometimes I forget it's on and I spend 20 mins debugging something when if I had turned it off it would've taken me 5. Thanks!

This just started recently but while watch any videos on espn.com, about 3/4 of the way through the video it stops and the video window says "any error occured during video playback, possibly due to network connectivity or being in a background browser tab. Please try again". It is easily repeatable and appears to only happen on espn site. Yahoo and such seem to play fine. If I disable uBlock, the videos play fine on espn but I have to suffer through ads. I have been using uBlock for years with no issues. I am running uBlock Origin version 1.20 with Chrome Version 75.0.3770.100 (Official Build) (64-bit). The same problem exists when I use Microsoft Edge browser with espn.com. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. I am trying to find how to install and older version of uBlock since this issue just showed up recently.

Today, youtube ads appear to have begun slipping past ublock's filter. The main page banner ad is particularly annoying, as it appears to be loading behind everything where I can't see it but can hear it. Actually, it might be possible that ublock is not working at all, but I can't tell that for sure because most ad services are blocked by my hosts file before ublock ever gets a chance to interact with them. Either way, something is broken, and now I'm bombarded by the most annoying ads on the web.

Today I noticed that I am getting a lot of errors on Youtube for 5 seconds or so before the video plays and sometimes static ads with a skip button showing. Picker mode is also disabled on ALL sites, not just the odd few there were the other day and none of the other uBlock functions work when on Youtube. I tried uninstalling, clearing caches etc and reinstalling and get the same issues. My guess is that Chrom updated today and nuked uBlock :(

Sometimes some YouTube videos cause a huge number of blocked messages. 10k, 20k, 30k, ...

After some time, this video stopped showing excessive advertising counter. This behavior I met for the third time this week. I like your application and I would like to report such behavior. Perhaps this behavior is YouTube for anti-blocking.

Not a virus, you need to know the definition of a computer virus before making such allegations. And if it won't uninstall, it is a problem with your computer/browser. There is absolutely nothing the extension can do to stop you from uninstalling it from chrome. Also yes, it cannot die, since chrome automatically attempts to reboot all extensions if they either crash/killed by the computer (chrome's fault, nothing you can do). A feature of the extension is that it isn't going to close, it will continue to protect your browser against whatever the developer thinks necessary. If you believe this extension is causing issues with certain websites, while on the web page, you can press the icon for the extension, and by pressing the blue power button and refreshing the page, it will no longer attempt to block anything on this website. Also yes, viruses are removable, but highly powerful malware may not be, but don't fear, since uBlock automatically brings up warning when entering sites known to distribute malware.

Hi, I've noticed an issue with Ublock Origin and Twitch. While it's not the issue everyone else has been having (haven't seen any ads on any streams/vods), I have been unable to clip videos. I've narrowed it down to this extension being the one that has been blocking the command which opens up the new clipping window (my other extensions dont interfere with twitch's clipping system when I disabled and re-enabled them 1 by 1.) I completely understand that you have bigger and more important bugs to fix right now though, this is just trivial :D

I've happily used Ublock Origin for years now, and have just noticed that in the middle of browsing, Youtube ads have stopped being blocked and started coming through. Is this an issue on my end, has youtube updated, or what?

This is intentional. If you want to create a permanent filter, you need to use the Picker. Picker saves your newly created filter to "My filters", while Zapper does not even create one (that's the whole point: it is a Picker that you can use on a single page visit (load) and avoid cluttering your lists). Element Picker: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Element-picker Element Zapper: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Element-zapper Please consider reading the docs in general: you'll get answers instantaneously: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki

I tried playing a few 60fps videos and didn't have issues, thus I can't test a solution. However, here is my best guess: There are two possible factors: added network latency and added resource load. The second is less likely, but easier to test: try disabling cosmetic filtering for YouTube. The network latency is more likely, but a tiny bit harder (for you as a user) to fix. Consider creating an exception filter for your specific case: exception would circumvent larage portions of uBlock Origin filter matching pipeline and thus would avoid latency cased by waiting for many memory-reads. Overview of uBlock's network filtering engine: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Overview-of-uBlock's-network-filtering-engine The rest of the docs are great too, so try reading them.

Google Chrome web store does not allow uploading images and limits message size, ask questions on Reddit to get more detailed responses. https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/ Here is my best guess about what you need: There are at least two "prediction services", I assume you are asking how to unlock toggle "Use a prediction service to load pages more quickly". Please see previous response. In short, go to chrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/dashboard.html un-check "Disable hyperlink auditing", go to chrome://settings/?search=Use+a+prediction+service+to+load+pages+more+quickly and now it will not have "puzzle" icon next to it and will be clickable. Click it to toggle to enabled state. Also, as always, better read the linked docs before changing uBlock Origin settings.

You are looking for uBlock Origin Dashboard > "Settings" > "Privacy" section, specifically "Disable pre-fetching (to prevent any connection for blocked network requests)" and, may be (unlikely), "Disable hyperlink auditing".

This is external filter issue (most likely EasyList). Please use the Logger to identify the problematic rules and report them to maintainers: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger Specifically, your images are located at http://www.sustainable-properties-forsale.com/adverts/* and EasyList has rule /adverts/ which matches them. You could try to contact EasyList maintainers to add an exception rule, or simply change the image addresses to, say, /images/* (since /adverts/* is "screaming" to be blocked by ad blockers). Note: This might not be the only rule affecting your website, but images load for me once I disable it.

Hi, First off, thank you for this incredible extension, it's easily the best ad-blocker I've ever used. But I have a website that won't let me read its content unless I disable it. I don't want to do that because the site then takes much longer to load etc. I was thinking you could develop a "light" or "incognito" mode that blocks the maximum number of elements without being recognized.

With uBlock Origin or uMatrix 'enabled', inserting pictures in e-mails does not work. Everything works fine up to selecting the picture on the hard disk and loading it, i.e. the progress bar shows that the picture has been loaded, but then nothing happens any more. On the pop-up screen with the progress bar, the blue 'insert' button on the lower left remains faded out and the two gray bars in the lower right do not react. The same probably goes for other attachments that are handled by the same GUI dialogue. Disabling uBlock Origin and uMatrix, the normal behaviour is that when the uploading progress bar reaches the right side, i.e. when uploading is complete, the pop-up dialogue for inserting a picture (selecting it from the hard disk) will simply disappear and the picture shows up in the e-mail message that is being composed. Issues like these are what makes the use of security and privacy software so tedious. Has anybody ever thought of not blocking them and instead feed bogus info, so that privacy is not compromised but the web works as it is supposed to?

Whenever I visit a website, it starts loading pop ups that tries to stop me from deleting the tab by going in and out of full screen.

Basically I'll be listening to spotify and when an ad comes up to be blocked it just freezes the site. The ad won't play BUT the tab at the top will read "Home Depot - Spotify". I can't skip to the next song or back up or do anything without reloading the page. After I reload I can listen to about 7 songs before the problem happens again.

break
TL;DR: If you hate any kind of telemetry or are a pro-user and know what words "[software] community" mean, you want uBlock Origin. Also, uBlock Origin might occasionally break, especially if you use an unusual Chromium variant. If you want a slightly worse but a very consistent experience in any browser and are willing to compromise some of your privacy in exchange, Adblock Plus might be better for you. In the later case, I'd recommend looking into AdGuard -- a commercial company offering technical support help desk, but with a different financial model: getting money from users, not advertisers. (You may choose to pay for the product, and are guaranteed that you won't become the product.) Their browser extension is free, while the revenue comes from selling "advanced" licenses to users for standalone computers and mobile programs implementing features impossible for an extension. So they do need to sell your privacy to advertisers, and instead rely on money paid by some users. For example, I personally bought lifetime license for Android to have DNSCrypt (encrypted DNS) and I'm really happy with it. Also, both block pretty much the same ads, since all adblockers just follow instructions specified by the filter lists you choose and all lists are maintained by volunteers external to either project, except for Acceptable Ads (maintained by Eyeo GmbH). There are some differences due to uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus having slightly different syntaxes, but most rules are compatible with either one. Adblock Plus is a commercial product from a very financially successful company (its developer Eyeo GmbH pulls in revenue in hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Acceptable Ads, while employing about 100 people). On the other hand, uBlock Origin is completely non-commercial hobby project by a very talented individual (Raymond Hill) in his free time, who believes any financial activity might eventually compromise the primary objective (protect user choice and privacy), and thus does not even have a dedicated website or forum to avoid any financial activity. Adblock Plus offers consistency and limitations of a mass-market commercial product (and takes a bit of your privacy in return, even if you disable Acceptable Ads). uBlock Origin offers complete privacy and is more efficient (from my personal experience and according to all articles online I could find), but if you have a question, you'll go to the user community (a topic on Reddit) and you might be expected to read documentation. Here is some stuff I'd really recommend reading: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Why-don't-you-accept-donations%3F Privacy Policies: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Privacy-policy https://adblockplus.org/en/privacy

Any Wikia page I visit is significantly zoomed in for some reason, making everything unreadable. The Chrome zoom feature is set to the default when this happens, so that's not the issue.

Would like a fix so I don't have to use the Chrome zoom feature to zoom out every individual Wikia page really far just to reach a normal, readable state.

Thank you for the reply. I'm not sure if we're talking about the same thing. I added several sites to "my filters", so the filter is present, and instead of silently blocking them, uBlock Origin returns the strict blocking page with the exclamation mark in the orange triangle and the text: uBlock Origin has prevented the following page from loading: ... Because of the following filter ... Found in: My filters Go back Disable strict blocking for ... Temporarily Permanently I don't want this notification, I want strict blocking to do its thing silently. If we are talking about the same thing, the necessity to report each and every site I intend to block is very counter productive, and I don't understand why it is required at all, if I already have the custom filter in my own rules.

Popup tabs/windows are blocked only when there is a matching popup filters. If you get the document-blocked tab/window, and it does not close itself, it's because there is no popup filters, you need to report to filter list maintainers so that they add a popup filter. Other blockers also require the popup filter, but in their case they would load the content instead of blocking it like uBO. TL;DR: report to filter list maintainers: https://forums.lanik.us/viewforum.php?f=62

1. After Chrome launched, i can open one-two web pages in tabs, and while pages start to load, Chrome hangs for a 10-30 seconds with message in status bar "Waiting for extension uBlock Origin". During this time i can't open tabs, settings, can't close Chrome, it just hangs. After that 10-30 seconds everything becomes normal and open tabs resume their load. 2. When uBlock is disabled and Chrome restarted - i have no hangs at all, so it's definitely uBlock Origin. Tech details: latest Chrome, Win 7, run in the background after browser closed is disabled. I love uBlock Origin but can't handle this hangs every time i open my browser after reboot or after wi-fi reconnection. It would be nice if you can figure out what's happening, i read about the same issue from many different people on web but looks like still no fix.

Hi, According to CCleaner, my install of uBlock Origin for Chrome includes a 1.8GB file called Windows.Media.Playback.ProxyStub.dll, contained inside the file fontawesome-webfont.tff.

I'm sure it could just be a weird false positive from CCleaner...

A moment ago I lost complete control of Chrome because of uBlock Origin. I loaded a page on Reddit (which I've been to hundreds of times and have an exception for it to not block anything) and out of the blue I started getting new tabs that would open to warn me about how it was blocking a script from running. I normally get one of those when it's working, this time I got about 50. They were coming faster than I could close them. Keep in mind, on this page I was opening I had uBlock set to not do anything on all of Reddit.com and I didn't click anything on said page. It was decided it was going to go wild with these new tabs. I had to close all of Chrome to regain control. I've been using this for years and this is the first problem I've had. Just wanted to bring it to your attention because it was incredibly strange... I guess I'll let you know if it happens again.

i have previously used other adblockers, and with them, if there is an ad that slips through the filter, you can manually block it and you'll never see it again, but with this program i can't seem to block an ad permanently, i need to do it (zap tool) again each time i load the page, how can i make it that i no longer have to block ads each time?

You reloaded the page after disabling uBlock Origin, right? Some requests might be fired only once on the page load and not retried without page reload. If you disabled uBlock Origin and reloaded the page and the problem persists, then it is not uBlock Origin problem. If you are not convinced, disable uBlock Origin on chrome://extensions and check again.

I belive many people who want advanced blocking options are using uBlock and uMatrix at the same time because uMatrix is great at blocking things but on soudncloud for example it will block ads but will also stop autoplay when an ad should be playing. uBlock doesnt have this problem but I think it misses the advanced blocking matrix from uMatrix. I think having the best of both extensions in one UI would really improve this extension and would fix the need of having both extensions installed (and im pretty sure both use the same blocking mechanism at a lower level so it shouldnt be hard to do this right?).

Hiya -- I seem to be having trouble with my yahoo webmail and this extension. about 75% of the mails I click on to read just never load successfully (and never displays as 'read' either). This seems to have started a few days before Christmas, though I'm not certain of the precise date. (too busy with the holidays :) ) I've enabled every extension but this one and disabled all of them except this one and I have successfully concluded that it IS ublock Origin that is causing the issues. this is a rather significant inconvenience... so thank you for looking into this quickly. I hoe your holidays are happy and your new year is.... better than 2016 was.

Random websites load, then disappear and show just a blank white screen (Enterprise.com, walgreens.com photo section). Reloading the screen does not fix the problem, only disabling uBlock fixes it.

Using an adblocker is actually illegal. Do you know when you use an adblocker you are accessing the website without paying the toll, which constitutes theft. Ads are setup so that the website can make money by selling their adspace. When people stop viewing the ads, then advertising companies start pulling the money from the sites.

UBlock has been working wonderfully well until now. Recently, Indian Express newspaper, http://indianexpress.com/ started demanding that I unblock their ads and would not allow me to visit their site. So, I stopped visitng their site. Today, their news item appeared on Google news, I clicked on it and there I see the page flloded with ads; UBlock failed to block their ads. Seems they were able to hack uBlock filter. I checked UBlock filter and it appeared non-functional! Lookks like Indian Express s/w disabled the uBlock. Can you fix this issue? You cann go to their website and test your product. Up until now, UBlock functioned outstandingly.

Sorry, there was a regression bug, maybe this is what affected you. Fixed in 1.9.10. What would help is more people running the development build -- this would make regression bugs more likely to be caught before release. As opposed to other big-name blockers, there is no paid developers/QA team for uBO, this is all voluntary-based work, so the more users contribute by testing the development build, the better.

This happens not for the first time. Two of the other lists (pgl.yoyo.org & malwaredomainlist.com) were having a problem with "Error type: Malformed certificate" and for 3-4 months (Feb-May (?)) they were unable to update (I "fixed" by using http: and not https:) I imagine such (intermittent?) problems can be avoided for everybody if you implement some more (backup) homeURL in filter-lists.json (homeURL2, homeURL3, ...) to be used automatically if the first URL failed.

If you can't access a website you can turn uBlock Origin off for that website by left clicking the uBlock Origin icon and then the blue button.

This is necessary to be able to: Disable "Prefetch resources to load pages more quickly" This will ensure no TCP connection is opened at all for blocked requests: It's for your own protection privacy-wise.[1] For pages with lots for blocked requests, this will actually remove overhead from page load (if you did not have the setting already disabled). When uBlock blocks a network request, the expectation is that it blocks completely the connection, hence the new permission is necessary for uBlock to do truthfully what it says it does.

uBlock seems to be preventing me from progressing in the transaction of buying an online ticket - from the page asking for a loyalty card number, clicking "proceed" shows a line about javascript at the bottom of the page, and it shows that it loads, but never goes past that.

The "Aww Snap" error means the browser process for the page hard crashed. Any case of crash needs to be reported to the browser developers. uBO may cause web pages to render differently when it blocks, but it can't hard crash pages, and if this happens, this is out of the realm of uBO, browser processesshould not hard crash -- please report to Chromium devs: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list

When I first download uBlock, it works fine, but after about a days use it stops working.

I have been extension for as long as I can remember, and have never- until now- had a problem with it. If you are able to fix it, please do. PS. I know for a fact it isn't a problem with the domain, because it will happen to multiple sites, and won't work on any.

Hi, I've been using uBlock for a few months now as it's the only adblock I've tried that doesn't affect Youtube. I've been having issues from the start and am slowly getting more issues. I can't find anyone else online who claims to have these issues, so I'm confused as to what's going on. My issues are that first some websites do not properly load information when I have uBlock enable. I have to turn off uBlock if I want certain websites to even load. Second that I am still seeing ads on some websites. The only websites this is happening on are primewire.ag and sometimes tumblr.com.

uBlock has stopped blocking youtube pre-video ads. I'm running Chrome version 49.0.2623.87 m. Just started today 3-29-2016.

uBlock doesn't honor the integrity of other extensions and redirect their internal code. In this case Blur.

Using uBlock with Firefox and the latest version of Windows 10 I've been getting an error message during the first 15 - 30 seconds of any video that is supposed to run an ad. I can whitelist the site and it will run fine but any YouTube video that isn't whitelisted gives the same error. Note that after the first 15 - 30 seconds (or the length of the ad that was supposed to run) the video refreshes and runs fine. However if you refresh yourself, it simply restarts the counter and you're forced to wait the length of the ad all over again.

As of this morning i get this screen on youtube for about 5 seconds: http://i.imgur.com/zESGJW0.png before each video plays, but it goes away when i have adblock disabled (replaced with an ad) just wondering if youtube changed the way they serve out their ads which could be causing this error screen to show up before playing the video?
-------------------------
error
Yep. I've been getting the same thing. The reason why I came to these comments in fact. If I disable uBlock, problem solved but then what is the point? Obviously isn't working with whitelisted pages but any video that isn't whitelisted is currently giving me the same error. After about 15 - 30 seconds (I'm guessing the length of whatever ad is running on that particular video) the error refreshes and the video loads.

Thanks for the tip Raymond. I've tried restarting Chrome/computer several times and I still get this error. It's also not localized to my one machine, but repros on several of my computers, and the only extension that seems to be having this issue is uBlock. Again, this only started happening just recently - it was working fine before.

You mean Chrome labels it as "corrupted"? If so, then you have malware on your computer, you need to clean that up. uBO can't corrupt itself, as it does not have the ability to modify itself, and does not have access to your file system. For cleanup, see step 4 and above: http://decentsecurity.com/holiday-tasks/

bug
Nothing changed, this issue has been present for a while: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1185 The _Save_ operation causes the browser to fetch the page again from the remote server, and for some reasons, as soon as a network request is blocked, the Save operation is aborted by the browser. I consider this a browser bug, you may want to file an issue with Chrome developers. Saving a page works fine with Chromium, but not with Chrome, so Chrome is doing something different.

uBO does not open a new tab, the browser does. uBO blocks the fetching of the document though for that new tab if there is a matching filter. You then chose to proceed or not. The ability to block the whole document is a feature specific to uBO. Other blockers will load the page even if there is a filter for it. This uBO feature is called "strict blocking": https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface#no-strict-blocking It is especially useful when a site tries to open nuisance or even malware site -- uBO will prevent the connection to even be made. Then you can choose to proceed ahead if you know the site ahead is actually safe, or close the tab.

Hi, i tested UBlock and UBlock Origin for load speed. UBlock loads much faster than UBlock Origin. Please fix this problem or continue Ublock project hanks!
-------------------------
load
UBlock Origin will slow down page loading speed guaranteed. Proof: visit any page and load up Devtools > Network. Page resource timing is noticeably skewed. It happens on whitelisted sites, too. The developer knows this and hates when people blame his extension, calling them "trolls" and referring to their reviews as "completely baseless" and "unsubstantiated claim". I'm 99% certain the developer himself is a troll who spends a lot of time trying to game the system.
-------------------------
load
You are still not providing *any* exact methodology/result figures, and whatever little information you provide flies in the face of common sense: To claim that "adblock" with default settings pages load faster than uBO with default settings is just complete nonsense. "Adblock" (whichever one you talk about) barely block anything with default settings, and the biggest factor which contributes to page load speed is all the bloat which is blocked. So to block less will always translate into slower page load. Also uBlock has ceased development months ago, and as such does not benefit any of the improvements brought into uBO, *including* performance improvement. So your claims is not only unsubstantiated, you keep stalling when asked for *details*, and your secret results/methodology make no sense and contradict findings from other sources, for example: https://www.raymond.cc/blog/10-ad-blocking-extensions-tested-for-best-performance/ At this point I can't conclude anything else than that you are trolling. Such statements as "reborn UBlock from you" supports that you are just trolling: uBlock Origin is the original uBlock as I envisioned it. Good trolling job, you got me to waste time to respond to you.
-------------------------
load
I'll give you a link that I can guarantee shows ads every time you load the page when you disable uBlock origin so you can test that it's a uBlock/filter issue, or another reason that isn't uBlock related. There are quite a few reasons you would not see ads even when hitting uBlocks power button. I will explain these other possible reasons. But first, open twitch.tv in another tab. If you already have one open, that's fine too. Just make sure that the power button is 'ON', aka uBlock is blocking ads on twitch. Now go here, with uBlock turned ON: www.twitch.tv/esl_csgo/v/25893492 You should see a screen that says "we are currently playing ads, gameplay is paused until ads are over." Sit there and wait for 10-15 seconds. Sit there until you realize this screen isn't an ad. just how they 'punish' adblockers/ensure people they can watch ads and the gameplay is paused. So, you got 10+ seconds of this dumb screen. Power button 'ON' works correctly then. Now hit the power button 'OFF'. Hit CTRL+F5 to force refresh a new noncached version of the page, but F5 by itself is probably fine too. Video loads to the same screen, and ads start playing in the main window after 1-2 seconds, and usually another one pops up in the top right above the 'more videos' section. If you saw only the boring screen the first time, and you saw ads the second time the page loaded after you hit F5 to refresh (you MUST refresh for this test!) Then uBlock is working just fine. Now, for some other explanations: Not everybody's channel shows ads on entry (pre-roll ads). It's an option, not everybody has it either. And not everybody who has it uses it. Its the most annoying and intrusive ad style. and he best way to get yourself adblocked. Nobody wants to sit there for 90 seconds just to see if that hot grill streamer in the preview is actually a professional comp. player, or just extremely high-skilled. Kappa. For ads during the middle of a broadcast, like between games, or streamer has to poop, or the pizza guy is at his door, so broadcaster clicks 'play ad' as they leave -- for these ads the broadcaster must be partnered with Twitch. They will have the $4.99 subscribe button under their video if they are partnered. If they don't, they can't play ads either, and probably dont have their pre-rolls enabled, they want viewers to come in to a small channel as fast as possible so they can evnetually get the viewernumbers to become partnered. ^ tl;dr - Smaller streamers without sub buttons can't play ads. If it's a streamer with a sub button who says 'im gonna play some ads please disable adblock i would appreciate it", you clicking the power 'off' real fast? No, sorry, you're not going to 'catch it in time' to see the ad. Natural stream delay, and often the page needs a refresh after clicking the power off as well. Additionally, if you are just looking at the twitch.tv frontpage, ads don't play on the 'featured' streams when you load the page. Most of the twitch ad rules are in the regular "Easylist" subscription, if you'd like to take a closer look. But I think its probably working as intended. Cheers :^)

Best is to use Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List, because it will require only a single read operation to fetch the filter list. This list is updated as often as all the component filter lists, so not an issue.

The first step to validate whether uBlock Origin is responsible for your slow down is to first look at the CPU figures in the browser's Task Manager (Hamburger menu => More tools... => Task Manager). Typically uBO is zero CPU usage when not actively loading web pages. See what in there is showing high CPU usage. If uBO itself is not showing abnormally high CPU usage, then look at which other extensions and/or web pages are showing high CPU usage. For web pages, note the URL and report here.

SECOND REPLY (to Raymond): I found more: When I reload I click to get the red cross over the "font downloads" icon - which to me would indicate I disable this feature in the extension, because it is the GUI of the extension - and reload Yahoo Mail IN THE SAME TAB then fonts are blocked. However, when I load it in a NEW tab I get plenty of fonts. I now have 12 fonts listed in the resources overview for that page - this time with a red cross over the "A" icon.
-------------------------
reload
I can only reply to myself here... You say font blocking is *disabled* by default. So by default this is how the GUI looks like: http://i.imgur.com/z5eftpD.png It says it blocked 102 font downloads. When I click on that icon it gets a red cross, meaning it is disabled. I interpret that as the blocking is disabled, meaning the functionality of the extension. But in either case I see - after reload of course - fonts datea1.woff, mail-ltr43.woff and uh.woff2 in the resources overview.

I got a question about EasyPrivacy, when I have it enabled the counter number keeps going up and up and it never ends, if I watch a stream it will go up to over 1000 in just a few hours. Is there any way to stop it from doing this?
-------------------------
stop
The only way to stop this is to create an exception filter to counter the filter in EasyPrivacy which blocks the network requests responsible for the counter forever going up. Use the logger to find out which filter is responsible for this, and counter it using a static filter, or a dynamic URL filter. See: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger The logger is the go-to tool when investigating uBlock Origin's behavior.

uBlock has access to the whole DOM of web pages (all blockers acting at DOM level do), so yes, it has access to that information. uBlock does not lookup that information though, its only purpose is to hide DOM elements which match cosmetic filters, or to collapse placeholders of blocked resources.

All blockers will cause your browser to warn you about "browsing history". This is not a new permission, this has always been in there since the beginning: no blocker can properly do its job without being able to access the URLs of all network requests. Chrome confuses user by making it sound like it is a new permission, but if you read carefully the warning, it just warns you about *all* permissions. The new required permission is "privacy", and it is used to allow uBlock to enhance privacy-sensitive options in the Settings pane in the dashboard: - to disable IP address leakage through WebRTC - to disable network pre-fetching (which bypass blockers) - to disable hyperlink auditing (which is used to track what you click)

It's possible to support this, however this would be extremely inefficient, as a blocker would have to scan the whole web page after it loads to find the keyword(s), as there are no CSS selector syntax to select text nodes.

It's for you own protection: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/0.9.8.2 If not disabling "Prefetch resources to load pages more quickly", your browser can still establish remote connection even for blocked network requests, hence your IP address could still be visible to these blocked remote servers. "Prefetch" enabled is a bad setting privacy-wise.

I transferred the ownership of the original project on Github to Chris Aljoudi, because it had become too much of a time burden on me. I made a fork of my own project so as to keep users of the Chrome store version properly maintained. Users of uBlock0 (zero as in "origin") will have to make the decision themselves whether they move to the new ownership or stay here, I didn't want to make that decision for them. I consider pretty much the version here to be feature-complete, so it will be mostly to keep it working fine and fix any bugs. Though I do not exclude adding features if they make sense, my focus is now stability and polishing.

Yes. The statistics will reset only when the root document changes. Nowadays, Youtube (and some other sites) do not fully load a page, they instead incrementally update pages. This means the statistics will stay. uBlock ships with EasyPrivacy enabled by default, and Youtube makes often requests which are blocked by EasyPrivacy, hence the count keeps going up. Probably the same would happen with another blocker with EasyPrivacy enabled.

It would be better to have µBlock update filters every day, rather than every 4 days. In my experience, when reports of EasyList breaking a site reach its maintainers, they fix it immediately. There's no reason to have us wait 4 days to get these updates.

It's a browser crash, this needs to be reported to Chromium developers. uBlock is written in javascript, javascript cannot cause crashes, browser bugs can cause crashes.

I second the request for a quick way to 'Pause' or 'Enable/Disable' µBlock. I find that there are quite a few sites that it breaks and it is easier to just turn it off temporarily and reload the site than to try to figure out what is breaking. Currently, this requires opening the extension handler to disable it and then doing it again to re-enable it. A right-click option in the icon would be much simpler.

Google Translate: "Maybe error can something else but we will not go far , go on Yandex , below the search advertising there, and a white frame is, for example adblock removes all full." I cannot see anything under Yandex search bar. I would need exact steps on how to reproduce, and a screenshot of what you see (file an issue on Github: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues).
-------------------------
stop
Since installing uBlock some websites are blocked and an OpenDNS "This domain is blocked" notice appears. I don't use OpenDNS. I don't know if all addresses in Chrome are resolved by OpenDNS, but it shouldn't use a different DNS than the system. And I don't want to block the domains it is currently blocking! How do I stop this? Btw, this is pretty major. This should be an off-by-default setting.
-------------------------
access
Addenda: it appears that the blocked domain I tried to access is not included in any of the lists used by default by the extension, so it seems that Chrome really is using OpenDNS to resolve addresses. This is not right. If I want OpenDNS I will set it so.
-------------------------
stop
When I am watching a long video or keep watching a playlist in full screen without exiting on youtube, the blocking counter keeps increasing. I had times where it was at 700+... I also noticed that this is effecting the performance of the browser. For example, when stopping a video, it can take over 1 second for this to happen. I am very sorry for my bad English xD
-------------------------
stop
It's normal, there is a filter in EasyPrivacy which blocks these Youtube net requests collecting stats which occurs at interval when playing a video on Youtube. The count on the badge is absolutely not detrimental to the browser performance, it just tells the truth about the number of net requests which were blocked. You can rest assured that whatever "1 second" delay you experience when you press stop, it's completely unrelated to uBlock, as uBlock *does not do anything special internally* when you press the stop button. If this still bother you, you can create an exception filter to override the EasyPrivacy filter in order for the requests to not be blocked: "@@||s.youtube.com^" (without the quotes). But my advice is keep the filter, it's part of EasyPrivacy for a reason. The number on the badge is for information purpose, whether the count is low or high has no bearing on uBlock's performance.

This was actually happening with ABP too, which is why I switched to ublock in the first place. Occasionally, it will hang on a web page forever saying "waiting on extension ublock..." until I disable/re-enable in. That's pretty annoying, and I would like if it stopped. I'm guessing, since it was both ABP and UB, that it's a list thing, maybe?
-------------------------
load
I did experienced this once, and restarting the browser (Chromium) fixed the problem. I don't know, it seems sometimes the browser, after running for a very long-time without restarting it can become in some unstable state. uBlock is non-blocking internally, and it's pretty fast at handling its job, so when this happen it more than likely the browser is in a bad state. What is your computer? What the filter count in use as show by uBlock on the "3rd-party filters" tab? I was using a poor 8-year old laptop for the last month, and I could see once in a while "Waiting for uBlock", but that was rare, and I never saw a page hang with "Waiting for uBlock". (I could not run ABP on that laptop, all page load became quite sluggish and laptop fan kicked in high speed all the time).
-------------------------
bug
I noticed that the blocked ads counter steadily increases even after a page has loaded (at least on some pages, can't confirm if this happens on every site). For example I was watching a YouTube video that is over an hour long, and by the end of it the counter on the YouTube page was up to 264. Am I misunderstanding what this counter represents, or is this some sort of bug?
-------------------------
break
This is the prominent warning on the front page of uMatrix's page on Github: "µMatrix does not guarantee that sites will work fine: it is for advanced users who can figure how to un-break sites, because essentially µMatrix is a firewall which works in block-all/allow-exceptionally mode out of the box: it is not unexpected that sites will break." I do not have a Facebook account. I suggest you visit this thread dedicated to uMatrix on Wilder Securities: http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/umatrix-the-http-switchboard-successor.369601/ I would expect by now some users have figured the necessary ruleset for un-breaking Facebook, and surely they will be happy to assist you. Eventually the presets will make things easier for everybody but I haven't found the time to work on this yet.

Stopped working today (8/28/2014) on Chrome Version 37.0.2062.94 beta-m (64-bit). No longer blocking ads.
-------------------------
bug
After using for quite a while, I saw some bugs. When opening Chrome there is a slight delay in blocking ads, often times it doesn't do it's job. The worst thing to do is to refresh the browser a few times to be able for it to remove the ads. I have observed this while browsing on Yahoo! website. Perhaps you can fix the said issues sooner. Thanks
-------------------------
load
Yes, this has been reported often times. Problem is the browser, by design, can't guarantee that extensions will be fully ready before loading tabs, i.e. extensions can't prevent the browser from loading tabs. So when uBlock launches, it has to load all filters etc, i.e. it needs to do a lot of work before being ready to block ads, but then the browser won't wait or even ask extensions whether they are ready before loading the tabs, it loads the tabs asap after launching the extensions. Improving load performance should help, and this was done with version 0.5.0.0+, which I wish to publish as soon as uBlock get out of "pending review" mode (I am currently not allowed to update it). From there, will see what else I can do to improve further load time, but still, this depends a lot on the amount of lists used, whether "Auto update" is selected, etc. As long as the browser opens tabs without waiting for extensions to be ready this is going to be a recurring problem.
-------------------------
bug
I created an issue, for this feedback: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/153 I closed it as not reproducible. You may want to contribute whatever data you have which made you conclude that uBlock causes high-memory usage on Youtube, and if the data is conclusive I will reopen the bug if I find something is wrong.
-------------------------
reload
I've been playing a video for 40 minutes now, and the memory footprint of the extension stands at 51MB (Chromium 64-bit with all filter lists selected except regional ones), which is typical given I have forced a reload of the filters by changing my custom filters on top of all this. What other extensions do you have installed? The browser's garbage collector make take longer to kick in when the browser is not idle enough. So if some other extensions are causing higher CPU usage, the browser won't fall into idle mode, and the garbage collector will become lazier. Currently my CPU stands at 5% for the Youtube tab, which seems sufficient for the garbage collector to kick in. Do you have the request log enabled?
-------------------------
bug
In any case, there are no bugs. You will experience the same problem with ABP because the page generate a random id for the element you want removed.
-------------------------
break
OKCupid is using a random id, so filters need to go around this. I find this one works: "okcupid.com###body_wrapper > #wrapper.clearfix.full_width > #page.grid_16 > div > div:nth-of-type(1) > div > div" (without the quote, cut & paste in 'Your filters'). But given how OKCupid is determined for users to see the pledge (using random element ids), they could also easily go around this one if they want -- and causes the site to break even for people using such filter. Maybe I or someone else can think of something better.
-------------------------
load
You can check everything above Spam404. Spam404 and everything below is mostly Adblock Plus filtering, so if you disable ABP filtering, it's not very useful to load and parse these lists. There is no harm in having the same hosts-based lists selected in both uBlock and HTTPSB, except that selecting the malware domains lists in uBlock is probably overkill, as it is already very unlikely that these domains are going to be hit, and if ever it happens, HTTPSB does a better job at blocking these since it blocks the whole page from downloading, not just its secondary content.
-------------------------
bug
What do you call "page crashes"? Is it the "Aw snap!" page? I cannot investigate without more details: steps to reproduce, version browser/extension, other installed extensions, URL addresses where the problem occurs, etc. I haven't seen anybody reporting such behavior so far, so it would seem there is something specific on your side causing this. If it is the "Aw snap!" page, it's really the browser crashing, and unless there is a bug in the browser, javascript can't cause such crash, it's a scripted language.
-------------------------
load
That would be <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/108>. Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed fix for this one, the browser doesn't wait for extensions to fully load before opening a tab, by design. There might be extensions out there which purpose is to manage tabs, and maybe one of them has a feature to prevent tabs from opening at launch unless you ask for it. I could try to inject content scripts into existing pages, but that would address only the cosmetic filters part (assuming this works anyways). That's the most I can do, here I created an issue for this so you can follow progress: <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/129>
-------------------------
load
PageAction are for short-lived extension code. That would means each time a page load, uBlock would have to load and parse all filters, and then register an event listener for net requests -- at which point its probably too late, many of the requests have gone through for sure as mostly all is async in chrome API. This doesn't work for blockers, that's why none uses a PageAction.

hi, if you set some webpage which contains ads as your home page in chrome or you will use "auto load last session" feature ads on that webpage aren't being blocked automatically by ublock you have to force refresh webpage so ublock will start to work... can you fix it or is it chrome's drawback?
-------------------------
load
It's a chromium-based browser issue: unfortunately there is no guarantee extensions will be up and running before page loads when launching the browser. Before uBlock can start blocking, it needs to load huge lists of filters, and this takes a while to complete, and the browser won't wait for an extension to finish whatever it's doing. It's by design in chromium.

You merely need to tell uBO that you want it to allow these resources. (They are blocked by default since most Internet users find these features overly privacy-intrusive.)
You can either:
- disable the privacy-related filters on the "3-rd Party Filters" pane (I don't recommend it, but this will fix all the social buttons everywhere): https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters
- whitelist specific resources on specific pages, for that refer to documentation (harder, but in my opinion wort the effort):

Ublock origin works for the most part, and up until recently it was borderline flawless. However. over the last few years, it has failed to keep up with various tactics used to circumvent it. Bestbuy, Twitch, various news outlets (even with javascript disabled) just to name a few examples.

As time goes on, more sites find ways to detect Ublock users and disable essential/simple functions (login, watch a stream, etc), and the only option is to disable Ublock when it happens. Workarounds don't get introduced, and as more websites add these tactics it will render Ublock useless except for a niche userbase.

I love being able to forget that YouTube has ads. And Spotify's web player.

Notable features: Element zapper (hold shift to keep using it), disable all blocking for the current site with one click (with complimentary reload button nearby), manual site blocking, premade lists for malicious and undesireable site blocking (sites such as ad redirects), easy options to disable said blocking temporarily (a few minutes) or permanently when encountering a blacklisted site.

I haven't used these, but it seems useful to have options to block "all popups," "large media elements" (i.e. autoplaying videos), and JavaScript (I'm afraid to know when you'd need that).

If ads come through, you simply should enable more filters.
uBO does not choose by itself what to block and what should be allowed, instead this is prescribed by filter lists. By default, uBO uses only the minimum number of filters beneficial to the most people and allows user to choose for themselves.
You can enable more filters on the "3-rd Party Filters" pane: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters

uBlock Origin is great but recently it felled in a conflict with Privacy Badger (a anti Third Party extension).
until you make it work (both Privacy Badger and Block in same-time) i stop using it. :(
-------------------------

It started out to be a great ad blocker, but then it started blocking too many legitimate pieces of code. Especially on e-commerce websites where it might block certain javascript code blocks which cause pieces of the pages to act unexpectedly or not work at all due to missing javascript and swallowed script errors. I removed this and will just deal with ads instead.

I only just got this extension after dropping Adblocker, and it seems to be running well so far. 

I've been able to get it to mostly match the settings I used to use on Adblocker, but the dropped star is because I'm unable to whitelist specific Youtube channels. The creator did come up with a third-party workaround, but I personally can't get it to work. If that feature gets added in without third party code, though, I'll probably add that star back on.
-------------------------

Switched from Adblock after the developer recently cashed out to an unknown entity. I saw uBlock Origin featured on a TWiT podcast, and was sold.

I also scrapped my outdated Javascript blocker, as I feel the Dynamic Filtering in uBlock Origin is a better alternative. This also resolves any conflicts there might have been while using a Javascript blocker & Adblocker separately. 

The developer refuses donations, and works at his own pace. Previous projects include HTTP Switchboard, uMatrix, uBlock, and now uBlock Origin.

I am a web developer (who doesn't have ads) who has been hurt by uBlock.

I installed uBlock to block ads because it is more efficient that ABP.  But then I noticed that uBlock also blocks a ton of important web development tools such as crash reporters (bugsnag, newrelic) and even self-hosted webstats (piwik), which means that it makes it harder to ensure my website users have a quality experience.

Most people install ublock as an ad-blocker but do not realize (because it isn't clear) that it blocks nearly all third parties services, even if they are not related to serving ads.

A list of essential web development services blocked by uBlock by default include: bugsnag, newrelic, piwik,  optimizely, mixpanel, customer.io, and pingdom to name just a few.

As uBlock becomes the new normal, blocking essential web dev tools (that are not related to serving ads) by default is harmful to web developers such as myself.

Twitter has been severly dysfunctional, examples: No timelines on Home Page or any user No Bookmarks or Lists Some Notifications but clicking on didn't show a tweet, just persons profiles Pages freezing I logged in and out, cleared cache and cookies and disabled "Tweak New Twitter" but still the same.

I don't have a Git Hub account but went to your Issues page: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/13357 and the third item down -- clicked the "purge all caches" button and nothing happened but there was an "update" button and clicked that.

I've been using this extension for at least 5 years, and on it's own it's a must have, as it blocks so much AND allows for manual blocking of html stuff on any given website. But in conjunction with ABP, ads/pop-ups/malware potential are absolutely taken care of.

However, as of writing this, the extension appears to be broken for me on Chrome, where pages refuse to completely load, and I can't access or manage the extension on my toolbar other than disabling it (which fixed the issue completely). I hope this is an issue that not many other users are experiencing, and it gets fixed soon, because this extension is a godsent.

Edit: Just uninstalled it and reinstalled it, if you have this issue, this seems to fix it

manual
A review after years of using it:

It is amazing and works great! But let me elaborate on that.

IF you don't know what you're doing, don't do it. I recommend reading the "manual" on github first, if you intend to highly customize it to your liking.

I did not know how to actually use it, for a veeeery long time... I did not know why ads were getting in, on pages and when watching videos(tv shows). And I added tons of custom filters to it, on top of its built-in filters, to force block them. Now, on top of making my PC very slow because of it, the ads were still popping up. And my PC is an R9 3950X with 32GB of RAM...
Well, in my defence, it's built-in filters were not that great in the beginning.

I was always complaining on github about stuff not working, and ending with the creator scolding me........ And everybody was always telling me to restore it to its default settings, use its built-in filters, and never play with the dynamic filters. I didn't understood why, and never listened, I was stubborn.

But this year finally I read the manual for it, and understood why nothing was working. And duh, it was my fault because I played with the dynamic filters when I didn't even know how exactly they work.
Then I restored it to its default settings and only used its built-in filters. And guess what, everything started working as advertised, with no issues. But to add, the built-in filters are way better than they used to be years ago. And more extension updates I guess.

So if people want to use it, I suggest reading its manual on github first. I promise a lot of confusion and things not working, will go away.

Also, this is not an AdBlocker. It may have some filters for blocking Ads, but it is a more advanced tool for blocking page elements and other stuff.

PS: Sorry @gorhill for being an idiot...

Overall great but I don't like that it blocks Honey by default and it's hard to stop it unless you just turn it off. It gives me the option to add to whitelist, so I choose that and it opens a page with a bunch of code and no other instructions. I figure it's good to go and it's still blocking honey. Would be nice if it made it more clear on how to whitelist chrome addons.

The extension as of the present time, completely stopped working on Google Chrome across all tabs. This appears to be the result of an update gone wrong, with requests being blocked coming up with the number "?". Please fix this ASAP.

Update: This issue I was able to resolve by using Extensity to shut off all my extensions and turn them back on. This issue lasted for many hours even when the browser was closed until I did this.

Update 2: Been a couple years, this extension has worked wonders. The latest update adding a "block element in frame" is welcome and I hope it helps get those particularly hard-to-delete elements blocked. Very impressed with this extension, everything else is a very distant second place.

Update 3: Breaks the Brave browser to the point it cannot load any webpages. Tested and verified this specific extension when turned on and off multiple times was the only culprit, no other extension replicated the issue. That is completely asinine and needs to be fixed. Flat 1 star until resolved.

NOT happy!!!!!!!!!!! I now no longer can use Google image search as more than half of the images are blocked with colour blocks and any image that shows up is unclickable!

I hate to be that guy but this ad blocker isn't really the "Holy Grail of adblockers" that people have been championing for years. Sure it's independant, open-sourced and lightweight, and while that's great and all, uBlock is a bit too extreme when it comes to blocking. For years I had to put up with many websites not functioning properly (e.g. cannot submit form, some UI elements missing), and then I finally realize that it's due to uBlock, so I turn it off and the site functions perfectly.

In the description it says "think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using". Well... I hate to break it to you (and I hate to sound ungrateful), but I believe those people are the reasons why some sites do not function properly. There are probably way too many filters that go off as false positives, which unintentionally block UI elements that were actually important for the site to function. I took a look at those filter lists and it made my head dizzy so I'm probably not going to bother trying to figure out the culprit myself.

So I am using this extension on my school computer, I am unable to turn it off which Im pretty sure is not on accident. It's a good extension, blocks garbage, but there is a HUGE problem. I am unable to use safe sites! There are sites I am wanting to use which I am able to use and use all the time at home. Please fix this issue because it makes me upset.

This is AMAZING. It blocks ALL the ads and trackers!!! But if you go to a website with ads (like the New York Times website) that can detect an ad blocker, I have to turn it off. So, I used Undetectable AdBlocker on that website! UAB doesn't block all ads. So I use uBlock₀ to block other Ads.

This is the first thing I install on any pc I'm using. Even if it's not my own pc. I don't understand how anyone can stand using the web without it. Blocks everything you don't want and easy to turn off on the 1 out of 1000 sites that it does negatively affect.

Works well against ads, but my problem is that I cannot turn it off.

After a period of using it I ran into lots of false positives. I wasn't able to receive e-mails and messages on my computer but I could on my phone, and upon uninstalling uBlock I discovered it was because it blocked the scripts responsible for loading content. I've also observed it blocking CloudFlare CDNs, making some essential scripts not load. To leave a review I needed to turn off uBlock as it was blocking the ability to rate the extension.

Something is up with uBlock all the sudden. I'm getting issues with web pages rendering. All the sudden for using this for years I am having to turn off uBlock to get some pages to work.

It's been a faithful companion on any browser I use for years. Unfortunately, it seemed to stop blocking ads on recipe sites. I know, makes me sound like a boomer, but since I use my chromebook as my recipe book... it's kinda annoying. These recipe sites not only make you scroll through a mountain of crappy dialogue about the recipe before the actual instructions itself, but now I gotta see completely ridiculous ads? Boo!

Other than that, I'll never use any other adblocker. I can't trust a site that asks me to turn it off; between them and Ublock, I"ll chose ublock every time.
-------------------------

Excellent ad blocker. But the developer refuses to hear us users and add a simple "DISABLE EVERYWHERE" toggle switch! (it could be Ctrl+Shift+the blue button, so no UI change necessary).

So we have to use Chrome extensions page to turn uBlock off and back on again everytime we want to make sure that it does not interfere at all with a web session. (e.g. buying something online with cashback)

Was great for years. Then this 'update' appeared at the end of June, and it's been nothing but pain and wasted time ever since. Yes, I've read the "release 1.28.0 notes". No, it does not solve the multitude of problems I now encounter daily across Websites I frequent. In fact, it's now faster and easier to simply turn uBlock completely off.

Addendum: with more experimentation, and starting from scratch (getting rid of YEARS of customized My Filters data), it's a much better experience, mostly due to simply disabling a number of the default Filter Lists that come with uBlock Origin. It seems to be that the combination of "old defaults" and "new block methods" were the crux of the problems I'd experienced. I'm constantly needing to add block rules to my 'new' My Filters & My Rules lists, but at least I don't have to endure what advertising majors call "the modern Web-browsing experience," full of crappy, annoying, MOVING ads, that track us across multitudes of sites.

I can't say whether starting from zero will fix anyone else's issues, but it's certainly worth a try if you've been using uBlock Origin for a very long time, and you've suddenly started having problems with uBlock since late June, making your browsing experience...let's say "irritating."

Not sure why this isn't more popular. It's by far the most through blocker I've used and handles YouTube as well. Where as many others allow ads to load and tries to hide them away, this seems to negate them loading altogether. It can be a little overpowered on rare occasion, but can easily be toggled off or sites added to a Whitelist.

I've been complaining about Chrome being memory guzzler for years... It turns out entire time I've used Adblock (later switched to Adblock for YouTube) that actually eat up more memory, even when not visiting YouTube, I thought Chrome alone was to blame for taking up memory, until I read that Adblock and Adblock (other ad-blocking extensions) are actually responsible for imbalance. That's why I found uBlock Origin, I can turn off for specific websites I want to whitelist, I don't have to see ads on YouTube, and much compared to Adblock but CPU/memory. Thanks for making it easier.

Has been amazing since I downloaded it, but recently I've been getting playback errors whenever I clock on a Youtube video and have too refresh the page for it to load.

manual
It's good, it makes it easy to block/unblock sites, and seems to block most ads (though not all). That being said, I might like to see an enhancement regarding possible recommendations/ratings to block or unblock a site. Perhaps the blocker could detect what it blocked in terms of knowing what ad-supply sites in the page have bad reputations. I have it set to block all sites except the ones I manually whitelist. 

Case in point, just a few minutes ago I saw a pleasant message on tomsguide.com asking me to unblock them when I found an interesting article linked in a Google search, and I went ahead and did. I should have clicked "Continue reading with Ad Blocking," however, because I instantly got hit by a compromised ad that replaced the article with a full-screen red page saying my Chrome was infected and call Microsoft at "this number" and a pop-up dialog box, which we all know is one of those fake tech support things. I immediately closed the page. Running MalwareBytes and McAfee scans indicated I'm safe from anything that might have gotten downloaded without admin rights, however. 

So, moral to the story is, keep everything blocked using uBlock Origin unless it keeps a site from loading correctly at all. I acknowledge that "recommendations" could open the extension to problems (fake recommendations, or even ad companies paying to get good recommendations), as I believe led to the downfall of at least one previous popular ad blocker.

I love being able to forget that YouTube has ads. And Spotify's web player.

Notable features: Element zapper (hold shift to keep using it), disable all blocking for the current site with one click (with complimentary reload button nearby), manual site blocking, premade lists for malicious and undesireable site blocking (sites such as ad redirects), easy options to disable said blocking temporarily (a few minutes) or permanently when encountering a blacklisted site.

I haven't used these, but it seems useful to have options to block "all popups," "large media elements" (i.e. autoplaying videos), and JavaScript (I'm afraid to know when you'd need that).

This has helped me for a long time but I'm taking off a star because I believe that by default it deletes your cookies and forces you to log into every website again every time you restart your computer.

Problem is the response to blocking. A] many sites starting to recognize blockers and now refuse to display content, B] I've seen some sites cause uBlock to show 80 even 100 blocks. So, I'm beginning to think the days are numbered for ad blocking via conventional transports. Although ads provide revenues for content, nobody sees how viewers dislike the current situation. Losing net nuetrality is their first volley. I expect Chromebooks and Android will begin to force ads before launching apps, bypassing our tools altogether. Then your only response will either put up or shut off.

After having this ad blocker on for a number of months, I've decided to delete it. I actually find that it blocks too much stuff. As a result, web pages often don't display properly. This means I have to turn it off for the site, making all the ads populate the page. It also has a tendency to block me from accessing pages when I click on ads from my email, the only ads I actually want to interact with. Sure, I can continue on to the page by overriding it, but sometimes that takes a number of clicks. I feel like this blocker gets in the way more than it helps, compared to other options. I will say that the one time I watched Hulu in my browser, I liked that it blocked their ads. But I very rarely use a computer for that service, so it just doesn't fit my needs.

Usually, this is solved by manually updating filters with purging cache.

Confusing and unintuitive interface.  Just a bare interface that indicates that some things on the page were blocked.  No means (or if there is, it definitely isn't obvious) of allowing some things but not others.  So basically the only thing you can do is leave it on, shut the whole thing off when it gets in the way, then turn it back on when you're done.  No middle ground.

I gave it a college try because Steve Gibson endorses it.  Now that I've used it for a while, I have no idea why he does.  Others that he's endorsed in the past are much better and easier to use.

Also, what kind of malware did it clean up? It is a network filter that merely blocks bad network requests, it can not uninstall another extension or even something on your system.

Great add blocker.

Throws an error in the console on some svgs and gifs on various sites, but specifically the site I do development for so every time the page loads there's an error in the console. 

Line 90 of contentscript.js of uBlock:
"if ( typeof vAPI !== 'object' ) {
    throw new Error('uBlock Origin: aborting content scripts for ' + window.location);

Tried everything to prevent the error from being thrown -- even if uBlock is turned off for the site and the site is white listed it still 
throws the error.

In short: Uses less resources than others with only one fixable issue.

Discovered this extension from Reddit and it uses a lot less memory than Adblock(the non Plus version) extension I was using for years. The only issue I have had with it in the past few weeks is that I have to manually purge and update all filters/lists every so often because most images or items on websites will not load. For example, no images on Amazon would load when searching for items, on Facebook I couldn't open comment replies, and on YouTube when I couldn't open "Show More" under the "Recommended" section.

-------------------------

Switched from ABP (adblock plus) to this wonderful new ad blocker. Why did I switch? I didn't have an issue with the "acceptable ads" program (where ads in a certain size range and unobtrusive behavior were allowed) - it was because the element picker was half functional. The element picker lets you block completely the additional stuff websites have. On many risky sites, ABP's element picker simply did not work. It refused to work on certain sites that made a large income off visitors. Then it was a cpu hog and I got tired of it (because google chrome is very heavy on my cpu as well). 

UBlock origin's element picker has no restrictions at all. Works on every site I've come across. And tested it side by side with ABP. It's smaller cpu usage is a nice bonus too. I'm praying these folks don't sell out either!

This app blocks a lot of useful functionalities of many site. After installing uBlock a lot of sites will have very strange errors. One example was Youtube stopped remembering where I left off on videos. So when I resumed to a video at a later time, it no longer played from where I last left off.

ABP was designed to block ads so we would be saved by the hundreds of singles in our area that wants to meet. However the creators got greedy and are extorting advertisers into giving them money and passing their ads off as "Acceptable ads" I realize that there is an option to turn that  off but I don't support a company or want anything to do with a company that does that.

Why are people endorsing this product when it is not working worth a crap?
I get aorund 12-18% blocking on average,that is not nearly acceptable.Also there is no easy use guide for this either,it just seems like a bad choice from other options such as Ghostery or Adblock.

I would say this uses less memory because it also does less,so that is not exactly the trade off one wants to see.

works great. but sometimes you need to unblock on a page, and like adblock, i would like that option on the ublock menu. i dont need to shut it off for the whole site, just that page thats being blocked. like the auto update too.

Much better than adblock, but it blocks webpages for me. Why would you block an entire webpage? You're not an antivirus program. Let us turn this "feature" off, and if there is a way in the settings, I haven't found it.

Had to be disabled on virtually every online shopping site I visit--I couldn't figure out why the sites were suddenly breaking, then would see that uBlock Origin had tons of blocks on sites that weren't displaying ads, except I guess for their own products.  Just too inconvenient to have to be constantly turning it off to make websites work.

Prevents other plugins from working properly (i.e. Forecast Fox can't pop up the weather window).

Prevents web sites from working properly, i.e. Capitol One 360, you can't login with this enabled.

A number of other sites wouldn't allow me to log in with this installed.
So, it's blocking more than ads, it's blocking functionality.   

Not clear from settings, etc. how to try to enable this.  If I turn off ALL the filters I can get some things to work.  But adding in ANY filters kills things like logging into Capitol One.

Smaller footprint, yup, but going back to AdBlockPlus so things work.

Much better than ABP, however, it does tend to block a bit too much. It would be nice if it was easier to block individual page elements like you can in ABP. 

Like, for instance, when on certain video sites, it manages to block the ads, but it also blocks some content. And therefore I can't turn it off because I'd lose the adblocking, but I'm also losing some content. 

But either way, it is still infinitely better than ABP. Thanks for creating this!

I had spend hours upon hours trying to get rid of several adware infections (Obrona, Offers4u, SASA). I tried malware/adware/spyware removers, antivirus scans, uninstall utilities, system resets.

Fast, slim, small and effective.
One of few addons that brings a real meaning to "µ" (micro)
 
But there is one feature I miss, and are a dealbreaker for me:
Being able totemporarily disable it alltogether.
I can temporarily disable µblock for the current site, but as soon as I click on an ad that IS interesting, trying to open a new window, it's blocked despite that µblock is temporarily disabled.

I have to turn the addon off completely, and restart the browser in order to click on that interesting ad.

I need the file name of where Ublock stores any URL information for Custom Imported Scripts There is no option to export or import the Filter Lists, the only way to restore and save that data is via the Settings restore from File / back up from file button. Windows 7 has all the cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm data stored in the Shadowcache which I have access to so I have multiple backups of 'Default' profile. So would cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm folder contain the USER Entered data as well? or do I need to go into another working directory of Google Chrome? If so please let me know which directories I should be looking into to find this data. Kind thanks, EJ

I know uBlock is not officially for Vivaldi but I thought I'd report it anyway in case you're interested in supporting it. uBlock has worked absolutely fine with Vivaldi except for one strange thing. I recently bought a KVM switch (StarTech.com SVDDDUA2) and whenever I switch between computers Vivaldi's front end on KDE (haven't tested Gnome) freezes completely, except for any videos that may be playing, I can stop and start those videos but once they're complete that part freezes too. The other computer, running Windows 10, is not affected. If I turn uBlock off then Vivaldi works just fine with me switching from one computer to another. I don't see the same behaviour in Chrome at all so it's most likely to do with Vivaldi but I figured I should report to both, just in case.

First, off this is a great extension, made even greater by the open source license. Thank you for putting so much effort into this extension. I've done a bit of research, and it seems like Amazon Prime Video ads come from the same server, so the normal method of blocking the ads probably won't work. Is there any way to block the Amazon Prime Video ads? I find it profoundly stupid that I have to pay a subscription in order to see ads in my TV shows. Thanks!

Using uBlock origin in Advanced Mode. Most of the time it performs as desired. But sometimes even disabling for a site/page doesn't work as desired. So one must go to right-click -> Manage Extensions, then disable uBlock Origin there.

My thought is that icon would remain in the extension's area but grayed out and with a red X on it.

When using ublock with discord, the discord client can't connect - being stuck in its ICE-checking phase (WebRTC signaling), even when checking at https://test.webrtc.org/ you can see there are problems with the network( UDP, Ipv6) a general problem of not finding candidates and in connectivity (Reflexive and Host)with the problem "FAILED [TIMED OUT]". Only after turning the extension off (disabling on discord or test.webrtc didn't help at all) then discord and the tests ran fine, WebRTC is being used in many web-based real-time communication-oriented services... maybe add an option to disable blocking WebRTC services? or something else?

Another suggestion (unrelated) for any adblocker developers really.... On imdb I have to whitelist the Review and FAQ's pages or else the pagecontent won't display. Easy enough: https://www.imdb.com/title/*/reviews?ref_=tt_urv https://www.imdb.com/title/*/faq?* . I can live with this, but it would be really nice to be able to block manually the most aggravating banner ads on those pages.

I have encountered online services that offer a choice of paying a monthly fee to use their service, or turning off the adblocker.

I use an adblocker for the security of not having my machine exposed to third-party sites associated with ads that infect machines with spyware.

Second that I am still seeing ads on some websites. The only websites this is happening on are primewire.ag and sometimes tumblr.com.

I'll give you a link that I can guarantee shows ads every time you load the page when you disable uBlock origin so you can test that it's a uBlock/filter issue, or another reason that isn't uBlock related. There are quite a few reasons you would not see ads even when hitting uBlocks power button. I will explain these other possible reasons. But first, open twitch.tv in another tab. If you already have one open, that's fine too. Just make sure that the power button is 'ON', aka uBlock is blocking ads on twitch. Now go here, with uBlock turned ON: www.twitch.tv/esl_csgo/v/25893492 You should see a screen that says "we are currently playing ads, gameplay is paused until ads are over." Sit there and wait for 10-15 seconds. Sit there until you realize this screen isn't an ad. just how they 'punish' adblockers/ensure people they can watch ads and the gameplay is paused. So, you got 10+ seconds of this dumb screen. Power button 'ON' works correctly then. Now hit the power button 'OFF'. Hit CTRL+F5 to force refresh a new noncached version of the page, but F5 by itself is probably fine too. Video loads to the same screen, and ads start playing in the main window after 1-2 seconds, and usually another one pops up in the top right above the 'more videos' section. If you saw only the boring screen the first time, and you saw ads the second time the page loaded after you hit F5 to refresh (you MUST refresh for this test!) Then uBlock is working just fine. Now, for some other explanations: Not everybody's channel shows ads on entry (pre-roll ads). It's an option, not everybody has it either. And not everybody who has it uses it. Its the most annoying and intrusive ad style. and he best way to get yourself adblocked. Nobody wants to sit there for 90 seconds just to see if that hot grill streamer in the preview is actually a professional comp. player, or just extremely high-skilled. Kappa. For ads during the middle of a broadcast, like between games, or streamer has to poop, or the pizza guy is at his door, so broadcaster clicks 'play ad' as they leave -- for these ads the broadcaster must be partnered with Twitch. They will have the $4.99 subscribe button under their video if they are partnered. If they don't, they can't play ads either, and probably dont have their pre-rolls enabled, they want viewers to come in to a small channel as fast as possible so they can evnetually get the viewernumbers to become partnered. ^ tl;dr - Smaller streamers without sub buttons can't play ads. If it's a streamer with a sub button who says 'im gonna play some ads please disable adblock i would appreciate it", you clicking the power 'off' real fast? No, sorry, you're not going to 'catch it in time' to see the ad. Natural stream delay, and often the page needs a refresh after clicking the power off as well. Additionally, if you are just looking at the twitch.tv frontpage, ads don't play on the 'featured' streams when you load the page. Most of the twitch ad rules are in the regular "Easylist" subscription, if you'd like to take a closer look. But I think its probably working as intended. Cheers :^)

I see a filter for popup from epicurious.com in the Japan filter list, same with slickdeals.net. So the issue is in the Japan filter list. Using a lot of filter lists raises the likelihood of web page breakage, so be careful about which filter list you pick. The next version of uBlock will offer an easier way to create workaround for this, but for now you will have to create exception filter manually to work around the issues. For the specific cases you mention, custom filters: @@||epicurious.com^$popup @@||slickdeals.net^$popup I did not try but I expect this should work.

i'm using µBlock now on my chrome web-browser for a while, and i have noticed something strange while watching videos on youtube. the small icon on the toolbar which counts the blocked adds is going up over time. it seems like every 5 sec µBlock blocks another ad. but i'm not doing anything. the video is just playing. initially 20 to 30 ads are blocked which is normal. that is the same with adblock plus. but after the video ended the counter has gone up into the hundreds. adblock plus does no such thing. what is µBlock blocking? if i turn µBlock off after it blocked the initial ads no further ads show up.

Hi. This is just a site-specific problem, which I can resolve by turning μBlock off for that site. Just thought I'd let you know of the technical issue though. Whenever I browse the site totaljobs.com (or any page within that site) with μBlock enabled, I can't click any links, can't even open them in new tabs. But when I hold my mouse over them without clicking, the cursor still changes into a hand, and the URL still appears in the bottom-left corner. So I presume μBlock must be mistaking some part of the site's code for an advertising script. This issue does not exist with AdBlock Plus on the same site. I also tried running μBlock in Chromium 35 with no other extensions, and it did have the same issue. Let me know if you have any trouble replicating this problem. But from what I've seen, I don't think you will. I am using OS X 10.8.3 in case that matters. Jonty

I second the request for a quick way to 'Pause' or 'Enable/Disable' µBlock.

A review after years of using it:

It is amazing and works great! But let me elaborate on that.

IF you don't know what you're doing, don't do it. I recommend reading the "manual" on github first, if you intend to highly customize it to your liking.

I did not know how to actually use it, for a veeeery long time... I did not know why ads were getting in, on pages and when watching videos(tv shows). And I added tons of custom filters to it, on top of its built-in filters, to force block them. Now, on top of making my PC very slow because of it, the ads were still popping up. And my PC is an R9 3950X with 32GB of RAM...
Well, in my defence, it's built-in filters were not that great in the beginning.

I was always complaining on github about stuff not working, and ending with the creator scolding me........ And everybody was always telling me to restore it to its default settings, use its built-in filters, and never play with the dynamic filters. I didn't understood why, and never listened, I was stubborn.

But this year finally I read the manual for it, and understood why nothing was working. And duh, it was my fault because I played with the dynamic filters when I didn't even know how exactly they work.
Then I restored it to its default settings and only used its built-in filters. And guess what, everything started working as advertised, with no issues. But to add, the built-in filters are way better than they used to be years ago. And more extension updates I guess.

So if people want to use it, I suggest reading its manual on github first. I promise a lot of confusion and things not working, will go away.

Also, this is not an AdBlocker. It may have some filters for blocking Ads, but it is a more advanced tool for blocking page elements and other stuff.

PS: Sorry @gorhill for being an idiot...

Overall great but I don't like that it blocks Honey by default and it's hard to stop it unless you just turn it off. It gives me the option to add to whitelist, so I choose that and it opens a page with a bunch of code and no other instructions. I figure it's good to go and it's still blocking honey. Would be nice if it made it more clear on how to whitelist chrome addons.

It's working great so far. If someday you try to use your Chrome and suddenly it can't connect to the Internet, uBlock Origin may be the cause here. The fix for me is this:
- Go to your "uBlock Origin Extensions" page
- Click "Extension options", a chrome-extension page will show up
- Click on "Filter lists" tab at the top, then select "Update now" button
- If you can't click on "Update now" button, try to click "Purge all caches" first, then click "Update now" then.
I guess the database is out of sync so that's why it messes up. Hope that help.

uBlock Origin is free and open-source, so you know you can trust it. Blocks all YouTube ads, completely removes ads from all websites. The ads simply disappear and there is no blank space or placeholder. It has not broken any websites for me. Only swagbucks.com has forced me whitelist it. It doesn't just block ads, it blocks trackers as well.

You merely need to tell uBO that you want it to allow these resources. (They are blocked by default since most Internet users find these features overly privacy-intrusive.)
You can either:
- disable the privacy-related filters on the "3-rd Party Filters" pane (I don't recommend it, but this will fix all the social buttons everywhere): https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters
- whitelist specific resources on specific pages, for that refer to documentation (harder, but in my opinion wort the effort):

first several years ago a filter exclusive to ublock origin replaced my btc address and stole, only luckily, about 15$. I know it waas this extension because once i disabled it the btc addresses would go back to normal.

Now it broke all of chrome for me, making me think this was an internet problem. Wasting easily a couple of hours of my life. I disabled, chrome works. I re enable it, chrome breaks again.

Not sure what shady things this is doing but its benefit to cost ratio is now 0 for me.

I hate to be that guy but this ad blocker isn't really the "Holy Grail of adblockers" that people have been championing for years. Sure it's independant, open-sourced and lightweight, and while that's great and all, uBlock is a bit too extreme when it comes to blocking. For years I had to put up with many websites not functioning properly (e.g. cannot submit form, some UI elements missing), and then I finally realize that it's due to uBlock, so I turn it off and the site functions perfectly.

In the description it says "think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using". Well... I hate to break it to you (and I hate to sound ungrateful), but I believe those people are the reasons why some sites do not function properly. There are probably way too many filters that go off as false positives, which unintentionally block UI elements that were actually important for the site to function. I took a look at those filter lists and it made my head dizzy so I'm probably not going to bother trying to figure out the culprit myself.

I find that to be the exception more than the norm, and if your having problems you can just whitelist the domain

uBO works with minimal site breakage with default settings/lists -- nothing has changed about this. If you add more lists or further customize it beyond basic settings/filters/rules, it will likely break more stuff. Also, do not use content blockers along uBO, they will likely interfere negatively with uBO's built-in counter anti-blocker filters.

Filter list maintainers constantly work on filter lists to address filtering issues, if you have any, please report to them, this is how those issues are addressed for all blockers, not just uBO (which also depends on 3rd-party lists).

Something bad happened recently. While this extension can get bloated and heavy on resources, it had  some really good filter lists, those lists now have quasi corrupted the extension breaking a lot of functionality on many sites like on Twitter and many more. Often, it won't block many annoyances and ads like it did before. Furthermore, the option to disable WebRTC actually enables it and it doesn't do anything.You are forced to use another extension to block WebRTC — unbelievable. As a result, I am now solely using Adguard instead.Perhaps one day I might return to Ublock. However, I think this extension is going to become unsupported unless it becomes a paid model.

Edge has been amazing, and Chrome has been very very BAD! And I don't want to use Edge, even if it is Chromium.

So, I went to google, searched gif to mp4, took FOREVER!!! Even while it was still trying to load the results page, I opened edge, got the results, and started converting my gif before chrome loaded the results... I'm really getting mad at chrome. I've tried so many things to get chrome functioning and  working right, I disable the only extension I have and... What is wrong with uBlock Origin? is too many people using it now, it the server it gets it's addresses to compare to overloaded, too many and unoptimized list of address to look up? Why has uBlock Origin turned Chrome so bad?

3 Stars for years of awesome usage. took 2 for whatever is wrong... I'm looking for the installation folder, maybe years and years of address cache has turned it bad, idk...

Was great for years. Then this 'update' appeared at the end of June, and it's been nothing but pain and wasted time ever since. Yes, I've read the "release 1.28.0 notes". No, it does not solve the multitude of problems I now encounter daily across Websites I frequent. In fact, it's now faster and easier to simply turn uBlock completely off.

Addendum: with more experimentation, and starting from scratch (getting rid of YEARS of customized My Filters data), it's a much better experience, mostly due to simply disabling a number of the default Filter Lists that come with uBlock Origin. It seems to be that the combination of "old defaults" and "new block methods" were the crux of the problems I'd experienced. I'm constantly needing to add block rules to my 'new' My Filters & My Rules lists, but at least I don't have to endure what advertising majors call "the modern Web-browsing experience," full of crappy, annoying, MOVING ads, that track us across multitudes of sites.

I can't say whether starting from zero will fix anyone else's issues, but it's certainly worth a try if you've been using uBlock Origin for a very long time, and you've suddenly started having problems with uBlock since late June, making your browsing experience...let's say "irritating."

It's okay, still getting ads on some website and YouTube. Also getting ads in Gmail which is weird, never happened before.

Not sure why this isn't more popular. It's by far the most through blocker I've used and handles YouTube as well.

I've been complaining about Chrome being memory guzzler for years... It turns out entire time I've used Adblock (later switched to Adblock for YouTube) that actually eat up more memory, even when not visiting YouTube, I thought Chrome alone was to blame for taking up memory, until I read that Adblock and Adblock (other ad-blocking extensions) are actually responsible for imbalance. That's why I found uBlock Origin, I can turn off for specific websites I want to whitelist, I don't have to see ads on YouTube, and much compared to Adblock but CPU/memory. Thanks for making it easier.

Pretty good adblocker with room for improvement.  While ublock does have the most stringent ad blocking it's a completely scorched earth product by default.  Unlike the original adblock there's not an easy way to operate in a blacklist mode instead of a whitelist mode (blacklist meaning ads are allowed unless you blacklist the site you are on at which point they are blocked).  .Ideally with one or two clicks it could be changed to a blacklist mode blocker.

The performance is good, and the amount of ads that are blocked is unrivaled.  Good product overall but I prefer the original adblock so I can allow more easily allow sites some ad revenue by default and only block them if their ads are obnoxious.

Combine this with Adblock Plus and ad-blocking gets significantly better.

So used to this app and how well it works that using a machine without it looks bizarre and bloated. Works great "out of the box" but with a few tweaks you'll never see annoyances or ads again.

It's good, it makes it easy to block/unblock sites, and seems to block most ads (though not all). That being said, I might like to see an enhancement regarding possible recommendations/ratings to block or unblock a site. Perhaps the blocker could detect what it blocked in terms of knowing what ad-supply sites in the page have bad reputations. I have it set to block all sites except the ones I manually whitelist. 

Case in point, just a few minutes ago I saw a pleasant message on tomsguide.com asking me to unblock them when I found an interesting article linked in a Google search, and I went ahead and did. I should have clicked "Continue reading with Ad Blocking," however, because I instantly got hit by a compromised ad that replaced the article with a full-screen red page saying my Chrome was infected and call Microsoft at "this number" and a pop-up dialog box, which we all know is one of those fake tech support things. I immediately closed the page. Running MalwareBytes and McAfee scans indicated I'm safe from anything that might have gotten downloaded without admin rights, however. 

So, moral to the story is, keep everything blocked using uBlock Origin unless it keeps a site from loading correctly at all. I acknowledge that "recommendations" could open the extension to problems (fake recommendations, or even ad companies paying to get good recommendations), as I believe led to the downfall of at least one previous popular ad blocker.

I tried to use the blocking tools like element zapper mode or right clicking and selecting block element, but these features don't seem to work either.  What happened, and why has this been a problem for so long without a fix?

Edit: I fixed this issue by going into the white-list settings and deleting all entries, and enabling cosmetic filtering.  Will update review if I find any more ads, but this fix seems to have restored the element zapper mode.

It is light and it noticeably speeds up browsing, unfortunately I had to uninstall it, since all non-ads related filters started to block Google ADs recently. There should Unbreak filter, which would allow acceptable ADs.

Use the Logger for X sites. And when you see an entry like "Popup" for the specific site, click on it, select Block, then click on Create to make a custom filter for that Popup. Also, the uBlock drop-down menu has a button that says "click to block popups on this site", click on it.

work much better than AdBlock! No noticeable performance hit. Whould be nice though if the processing of getting non-ads removed from lists. See the incident with Troy Hunt's sponsor *text* being removed: https://www.troyhunt.com/ad-blockers-are-part-of-the-problem/

This has helped me for a long time but I'm taking off a star because I believe that by default it deletes your cookies and forces you to log into every website again every time you restart your computer.  I disabled the "EasyPrivacy" filter and it seems to have solved the problem.  I'll edit this review if that turns out to be wrong.

Your filter manager is rude. He shares his filter managing with NanoAdBlocker. I found a problem with one of the filters blocking "The White House" on Facebook, on NanoAdBlocker and reported it. Well I was berated and belittled on their GitHub due to not being helpful and posting about politics. I had my comments deleted and threatened to be blocked. So I switched back to UBlockOrigin. It was fine for a day but as of today it is also blocking "The White House" on Facebook. So I reported it on UblockOrigin's GitHub and lo and behold the filter manager posts on there as well and insults my intelligence stating that I am incapable of understanding the complexities of a filter list so I should just refrain from ever posting again. I didn't get a "Thank you for bringing this up, we will look into it and resolve this issue." No instead I got insulted and harassed. Right before I posted this review someone did state in the Ublock Origin Github that the App and the filter list on Ublock Origin were managed by different people that the issue will eventually get resolved. However he didn't state it would get resolved because of my input (I was the first to report it) but instead stated that "it would have gotten resolved eventually".

Filters are powerful tools. The default ones should be ok for most people, and if it blocks stuff on a website where you don't want it to block anything, you can just whitelist the site.

You should probably turn off some of the filter lists. I used to have this problem so I deactivated the default filters and only use easylist and Peter Lowe's ad list. Since then I haven't had the issue.
-------------------------
filter
Usually, this is solved by manually updating filters with purging cache.

Filter obsolescence is common to most ad-blockers, since all of them use the same filter-lists. Furthermore, filter-lists are maintained by volunteer users, so if you see a specific problem consider reporting it to their forums to help fix it.

Was working perfectly for years up until last week when it started acting weird.  When I click on a "comment" link on Facebook, it just refreshes the screen and removes the story.  I disable UBlock and it works like normal.  I don't want to have to whitelist Facebook, as I want to block the plethora of ads on there... not sure where to go from here.

That is very interesting, could you provide concrete examples so that developer could add a third-party filter list for your use case? You might need to use one of hundreds other lists not endorsed by uBlock Origin: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists-from-around-the-web

TL;DR: Enable more filters https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters

Are you using the Picker to select ads? Ads might have unique properties (generated on every page load), in this case you'd need to use regular expression to describe them. Or better yet, use additional filter written by someone external to uBlock Origin (third-party filter) -- see link above.

It's better than nothing  now that ABP is going to add ads of their choosing for a revenue source. I only moved back to ABP because it  handled pop-ups better,  the element blocker seemed to be much better. 

Here if I set an element to be blocked with wildcards(*), it is only for the session. If I come back or refresh the page, those elements get reloaded.

I wish they would block Facebook ads like Fluffybuster Purity does but FBP can slow down how any website can load because it reads your feeds much like how uBlock works and filters content. 

I can use the element blocker to hide a specific ad, but on page reload, the ad is back. So it's kinda pointless. 

That is where ABP shines. Elements blocked stay blocked regardless of how many times the page is reloaded, but where they pale is their ability to intercept pop-ups and pop-unders.

If ads come through, you simply should enable more filters.
uBO does not choose by itself what to block and what should be allowed, instead this is prescribed by filter lists. By default, uBO uses only the minimum number of filters beneficial to the most people and allows user to choose for themselves.
You can enable more filters on the "3-rd Party Filters" pane: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters

It really does cost less in performance compared to other adblockers. Works on everything so far, whitelist options available. More sites detect this extension now so, where as before I was able to use 100% of whatever sites features I was surfing. Not a problem tho, still blocks, at a lot less hardware performance.

works well enough, especially the element picker. However i don't care enough to do more than use the element picker, so that can cause problems if you say block a trailer video banner thing at the top of Netflix then it goes a little wonky when you actually try to watch a video on Netflix. Now there is some way to change filters, but that is not  immediately obvious as to how to do it from the right click menu.

This extension like every other adblocker I've come across only blocks, and is only capable of blocking, what you tell it to. If it's blocking too much for your liking then simply subscribe to less filter lists. You could also disable "generic cosmetic filtering" which you should notice making a real difference alone but again, at the end of the day, it's only blocking (or allowing) what you and every other user instructs it to. I would suggest taking a few hours out of an evening reading up on how to write filters to block ads dynamically, statically, and more relevant to your issue how to add exceptions (whitelisting). It's really not that difficult but the onus is on you to tell whatever blocker you use what to allow and what to block. You could even unsubscribe from every list meaning it won't block anything and use the new "zapper" feature which will block whatever elements you click on a page without creating any permanent rules but if you subscribe only to the filter lists you know you want and unsubscribe from the others, and disable generic cosmetic filtering (should be already done by default) you'll be good to go.  
-------------------------
filter
The behavior of uBlock Origin is entirely defined by the filter lists you use (that's true for most other blockers too.) You can enable more filters in the settings (or subscribe for outside rules). If you want to find more filters, filterlists.com should help (disclaimer: I'm filterlists.com contributor).
Also, default settings + Russian filters work for me... so I don't know what ads you see. Although I have an idea: default lists might not include rules for adult sites (because they are not useful for most people).

If you see ads with (any network filter extension), you should subscribe to more filter lists.

Also, what kind of malware did it clean up? It is a network filter that merely blocks bad network requests, it can not uninstall another extension or even something on your system. If you did have adware (malware displaying ads) it might have blocked the requests, but the software is still on your system. I'd recommend fixing it manually.

What is the problematic site?

This is a problem with the filters you use. How to fix:
1. Go to the website with this problem;
2. click on uBO icon -> menu will appear, click on little list icon on the right of a pipette. That will open the logger in a new tab.
3. Click on the original tab and go through the website till you know an image was blocked.
4. In the logger red means  blocked, find URL that looks like it corresponds to that image. Click on the rule to see in which list the erroneous rule appears, disable (un-check) that rule on this tab and click "apply":

I used ABP for years till I ran into some :text: ads that couldn't be blocked. UBO stopped them all. My only recommendations would be for it to auto update when there is a new release and to have the ability add or remove requests blocked without having to make a custom filter if that is even possible. #UBO4life

The good
• I love it. It is owned and supported by a friendly community. Not a corporation. More secure because its code is publicly available for review and contributions on GitHub at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
• Easy to use. With both basic or advanced modes.
• Lightweight on memory and CPU resources
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome
• Clear Manifesto:
......• The user decides what web content is acceptable or not in their browser.
......• The uBlock project does not support Adblock Plus' "Acceptable Ads Manifesto", because the "Acceptable Ads" marketing campaign is really the business plan of a for-profit entity.
......• Users are best placed to know what is or is not acceptable to them. uBlock's sole purpose is to give users the means to enforce their own choices.
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome.
• Lots of features
• uBlock Origin has a better track record at fully protecting your privacy, than AdBlock Plus (ABP). There is a controversy around ABP and its related for profit corporation trying to monetize ABP via ad whitelisting. Which means that corporation sales your privacy for profit :( Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adblock_Plus#Controversy_over_ad_filtering_and_ad_whitelisting

The bad
• Confusion with the names. Between "uBlock Origin" and "uBlock". For those not familiar with those names, uBlock Origin is better than uBlock. Mostly because as of May 2017 Ublock Origin is still actively maintained and updated. Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin#uBlock_.28ublock.org.29uBlock Compare to uBlock which as not been maintained and updated for more than 2 years, since 2015, and is trying to monetize an open source project.

That is not uBlock issue, but a filter list issue. Look at the request logger (uBlock one, not Developer Tools) and disable the list preventing correct operation.

In case issue persists:

This is not uBlock issue, it is filter list issue. I had been watching YouTube for a while today and saw no ads. You can either:
 - enable more filters. I opened tab YouTube and played a video (no ads appeared) and looked at the logger. All requests are blocked either "Dan Pollock’s hosts file", "Peter Lowe’s Ad and tracking server list", or "Easy Privacy". Try enabling them.
 - If previous step did not help, you could try creating a new rule (by looking at request logs either in Developer Tools or uBlock one).
 - If first step did not help and you were confused by/skipped the second step, just wait. Someone else will update the list soon.

Instead of slamming this guy w/ a low rating the first time a new ad-serve network is affecting you with pop-ups, why not try this.

Go into your subscription list, clear the cache there and then update your subs right after (yes even if you have auto update enabled)

Additionally, consider adding another subscription list that specifically deals w/ your issue, in this case pop-ups.

Thirdly, you could start adding new offenders / ad serving networks to your custom list and then share that info with your favorite list maintainer and help make the ad-block list volunteer community that much better.

This has been the best of this segment of apps in my opinion - but it's getting less and less effective as sites find ways to detect the program and deny you entry for using it.

Great add blocker.

Throws an error in the console on some svgs and gifs on various sites, but specifically the site I do development for so every time the page loads there's an error in the console. 

Line 90 of contentscript.js of uBlock:
"if ( typeof vAPI !== 'object' ) {
    throw new Error('uBlock Origin: aborting content scripts for ' + window.location);
}"

Tried everything to prevent the error from being thrown -- even if uBlock is turned off for the site and the site is white listed it still 
throws the error.

Pretty trivial but annoying enough for me to switch back to ABP.

Just (1) figure out which list blocks it (via the logger) and disable that list or (2) white-list it yourself.

I really like this extension, I use it along with uMatrix for safe browsing. 
 
A few additional features would earn it 5 stars from me. 

* White list a YouTube channel (I understand this isn't easy to do). 

* The buttons at the bottom to block Fonts, Cosmetic filtering, etc are a bit confusing, they're set up weird and it bugs me. So if I want to just block all that junk on a site, instead of them all having an "X" through the icon, they're instead inconsistent. Like, blocking Fonts has an X through it, but cosmetic filtering doesn't, and as for the other 2, I have no idea if they're turned on or not without testing it or looking through the options.  

I understand why its set up like that, I get it. But I just think it's a slightly bad design choice for those 4 buttons. 

Minor grumbles really.

I did some testing to see to what extent it could block things, it also manages to close the connection of my nemesis: The invisible "click here and a new tab opens up telling you to trade binary options" ad.

HOW DO I PAY YOU FOR THIS
-------------------------
whitelist
The best adblocker by far. Lightweight and blocks all ads (not sellout like Adblock Plus which shows acceptable ads). Plus you can whitelist any site very easily. However best thing is the speed, it's consumes very little memory. Good job developers!
-------------------------
whitelist
Does what it is supposed to...easily whitelist pages you want to help that have unobtrusive ads.
-------------------------
whitelist
Not a bad blocker, but my main problem (and the thing that I really enjoyed about ABP before they sold out) is the fact that when you put a website on the whitelist it only allows adds ON THAT PAGE. ABP allowed you to whitelist entire domains, not just individual pages. The ability to do that with uBlock would be nice as well.
-------------------------
whitelist
I only just got this extension after dropping Adblocker, and it seems to be running well so far. 

I've been able to get it to mostly match the settings I used to use on Adblocker, but the dropped star is because I'm unable to whitelist specific Youtube channels. The creator did come up with a third-party workaround, but I personally can't get it to work. If that feature gets added in without third party code, though, I'll probably add that star back on.
-------------------------
whitelist
I was able to whitelist specific youtube channels easily.  All I did was go the the channels home page on youtube and take that URL and copy and paste that in its entirety to the whitelist box in the settings.  Then click apply and that's it.  I went back to youtube and that channel was now not blocked  but the rest of youtube outside of the channel was having ads blocked etc.  Does that not work for you?

It's OVER blocking stuff, and even when giving permissions, the pages that I want whitelisted do not load correctly unless I disable uBlock. Particularly my infusionsoft accounts which are my affiliate accounts that I MUST have working properly.

Best out there, but help feels like a developer with no people skills.  The best walkthroughs are NOT by the developer.

  Left is global, Right is per current site.  Green/Red is allow/deny and Gray is allow unless explicitly denied from a filter(rule).... like allow unless my adblock list blocks something from a */advertisement/* type filter. 

uMatrix is the super-advanced version, with even worse documentation... not worth the extra effort, but uBlock rocks.  Make sure you use the Origin version.

Slim down all the crap your browser is told to download by the sites you're visiting. Great for users more comfortable tweaking settings as well as those who just want a cleaner surfing experience. 

For those in the latter category: be prepared for more interaction with your browser as you may find videos, images, comment sections, etc., not loading like you're accustomed to. 

Once you learn the ad block way, you can never go back.

Definitely, I wrote this back before I even discovered the advanced dynamic filtering, which allows me to have on-the-fly customization of how web-content is blocked.

It slows down video streaming on some sites, I suspect by blocking some streaming sources.

uBO actually does more with less: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-and-others:-Blocking-ads,-trackers,-malwares#. That benchmark is a bit old, I expect uBO would actually do better nowadays.

Ghostery blocks *only* what is in its library (under 3000 filters last I checked).

uBO is open-ended in what it can block, and it actually provides the tools to disclose *all* the connections made by a web page, and the ability to point-and-click to block those connections. See https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide#.

Adblock is no longer a match for uBlock Origin -- there are many things it can not block which uBO can block -- especially when it comes to sites using anti-blocker mechanisms. For example: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Inline-script-tag-filtering#concrete-examples-of-usefulness

For the doc: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki

uBO is uncompromisingly pro-users, I do expect it to be more and more the target of some who have a pro-ads/trackers/data miners bias.

Of course you will see something like "Storage used: 15,249,140 bytes" depending on which lists you use (So you compare wrong: package size to "Storage used")

uBlock Origin comes with a logger, which gives the ability to inspect what uBlock is doing with network requests and DOM elements, whether something is blocked or allowed, and which filter, if any, matched a network request or DOM element

Just spell out the details of what "doesn't  work", somebody will probably be able to help. Here is a list of reasons of why blocking an image may not work:

https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Element-picker#the-removed-element-reappear-when-you-reload-the-page

- The URL or selector for the blocked element has variable part(s) in it, which changes each time a page is loaded.

- Cosmetic filtering is disabled for the site, or globally.

- You un-checked My filters in the 3rd-party filters pane in the dashboard.

- There is a static filter in one of the 3rd-party filter lists in use which counters your filter.
-------------------------
filter
You can un-select filter lists if you wish: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters#. For reference, most other blockers come with only EasyList selected by default.

Switched from Adblock after the developer recently cashed out to an unknown entity. I saw uBlock Origin featured on a TWiT podcast, and was sold.

I also scrapped my outdated Javascript blocker, as I feel the Dynamic Filtering in uBlock Origin is a better alternative. This also resolves any conflicts there might have been while using a Javascript blocker & Adblocker separately. 

The developer refuses donations, and works at his own pace. Previous projects include HTTP Switchboard, uMatrix, uBlock, and now uBlock Origin.

Significantly reduced memory usage vs ABP even with many more filters enabled.  Reduced CPU usage, reduced load times.

Looks decent but only supports block-all-except-whitelist.

I don't want to use a blocker unless it has an allow-all-except-blacklist mode.  (ie. use the same list of "ad domains", but don't block anything on any domain unless specifically requested)

Prevents other plugins from working properly (i.e. Forecast Fox can't pop up the weather window).

Prevents web sites from working properly, i.e. Capitol One 360, you can't login with this enabled.

A number of other sites wouldn't allow me to log in with this installed.
So, it's blocking more than ads, it's blocking functionality.   

Not clear from settings, etc. how to try to enable this.  If I turn off ALL the filters I can get some things to work.  But adding in ANY filters kills things like logging into Capitol One.

Smaller footprint, yup, but going back to AdBlockPlus so things work.

I am a web developer (who doesn't have ads) who has been hurt by uBlock.

I installed uBlock to block ads because it is more efficient that ABP.  But then I noticed that uBlock also blocks a ton of important web development tools such as crash reporters (bugsnag, newrelic) and even self-hosted webstats (piwik), which means that it makes it harder to ensure my website users have a quality experience.

Most people install ublock as an ad-blocker but do not realize (because it isn't clear) that it blocks nearly all third parties services, even if they are not related to serving ads.

A list of essential web development services blocked by uBlock by default include: bugsnag, newrelic, piwik,  optimizely, mixpanel, customer.io, and pingdom to name just a few.

As uBlock becomes the new normal, blocking essential web dev tools (that are not related to serving ads) by default is harmful to web developers such as myself.

I had spend hours upon hours trying to get rid of several adware infections (Obrona, Offers4u, SASA). I tried malware/adware/spyware removers, antivirus scans, uninstall utilities, system resets.

Works great and low in resource usage.

It can be a little overzealous in its default configuration. Be sure to visit the Settings page and uncheck any lists you don't want used. For example, the Social blocking list may block some website functionality, so you may want to uncheck that one.

Does what it says on the tin, a better version of ABP.

My only problem is that it crashes Chrome when viewing Barclays online banking. I had the same issue with ABP though, where whitelisting the site fixed the problem. This doesn't seem to be the case with µBlock for some odd reason. I actually have to disable the extension every time I want to use online banking which is very frustrating. A fix would be great!

Thanks for the hard work.

Long story short I finally disabled all extensions and added back one by one and U Block Origin was the culprit. I don't have a Git Hub account but went to your Issues page: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/13357 and the third item down -- clicked the "purge all caches" button and nothing happened but there was an "update" button and clicked that.

My Google Chrome Crashed and my extensions are bad. I have repaired the EXTENSION it self but I have lost all my FILTER LIST DATA I need to get an USER Entry URL from the actual User files that contains all the entries for the Custom Imported Filter lists which are still in my system restore data entries for Windows. I cannot get it from "my-ublock-backup_2021-11-16_06.58.22.txt" Since it does not have it in there, the only way is manually going into the Working Directory of cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm, but I don't know how your extension is coded, I don't know anything about it only the fact of where the extension installed which is in the DEFAULT/EXTENSIONS/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm So my question to you is where in the working files do I need to go? I need the file name of where Ublock stores any URL information for Custom Imported Scripts There is no option to export or import the Filter Lists, the only way to restore and save that data is via the Settings restore from File / back up from file button. Windows 7 has all the cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm data stored in the Shadowcache which I have access to so I have multiple backups of 'Default' profile. So would cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm folder contain the USER Entered data as well? or do I need to go into another working directory of Google Chrome? If so please let me know which directories I should be looking into to find this data. Kind thanks, EJ

I tend to leave Google's search results page unfiltered, and whitelisted. However, in the last few days (seemingly after the recent update) it has been causing an issue with their snippets feature.

I'd like uBo to function more like uMatrix, where disabling it on a site is only temporary unless you click the padlock icon to make it permanent. Often, a site won't work and, instead of fiddling with it, I'll just disable uBo to get it to work. The problem is, that adds it to the whitelist, and now it's always disabled on that site. I don't want it to be permanent by default, and I don't think it's a good idea for it to be, since I've been using uBo for a long time now and only just recently realized this, so a lot of the sites I've been going to have been unprotected, and I imagine many others have made the same mistake.

When you (think you) got it expand it and go to the static filter tab, from here add an exception to allow the video feed from this site.

The only way I've found to watch videos, including and especially the live news broadcast on the WHIO ( https://www.whio.com/whio-tv/ ) website is to Allow w3.cdn.anvato.net within the uBO browser extension. My goal is to help make this viewable to all. I found the solution by becoming an "advanced user". Please make this allowable by default rules or filters in the next release. * Please note that many of us in the WHIO broadcast cannot receive a stable over-the-air television signal, and as such rely on the website to retrieve our news updates. If there is something I'm missing, please let me know at your earliest convenience. Thank you all so much for your hard work and dedication to this project! _

Guten Tag Ich versuchte/verwendete viele Werbeblock Filter. Finde diesen von UBlock Origin 1.21.6 sehr gut!!! Nun ist es so, dass der Filter die Abspielung/Play Funktion auf einmal auf dem Laptop Now blockiert, was vor ca.1 Monat nicht der Fall gewesen war. Nun deinstallierte ich gar die App kurz. Ich installierte es dann nochmal und es ist immer noch so, dass es die Abspielung blockiert (nichts verändert, also wie es geladen wurde!). Es geht nur, wenn ich diese sofort kurz ausschalte und nach dem Laden sofort wieder einschalte ca.1-2 Sekunden! Sonst kommen viele Werbungen rein beim gucken. Das was mich sehr wundert, dass genau die gleiche App vorher die Seite zuverlässig wie jetzt blockierte, aber vor 1 Monat es nicht immer mühsam mit manuell Ein und Abschalten ging wegen dem Blocker, um die Sendungen auf Tv Now ( Berlin Tag und Nacht) zu schauen können. Das mühsame ist, das wenn ich vor dem Laden den Filter deaktiviere und gleich beim Laden schnell aktivieren muss, sonst rattern mir die Werbeblöcke nur so rein beim gucken der Sendung!! Also ist der Filter nach dem Laden sofort in ca.1- max 2 Sek einzuschalten! Stress pur :-)). Leider fand ich beim Googeln auch keine Hilfe, in der Sache. Unten beim anklicken vom Blocker hat es ja 5 Symbole zur Anwendung sowie hat es 4 Symbole auch oben, finde auch da keine wirkliche Funktion die es irgendwie unterbinden tut. Dankeschön.

When looking at items on Gumtree, uBlock Origin appears to be sometimes filtering out the items' locations at the top of the page. I believe it's because some items have ads underneath the location (e.g. cars have a Compare the Market 'Get insurance quote' link that appears under the location if uBlock is off, but when I turn uBlock on the location disappears along with the ad). Would be great if this could be fixed.

One of the things I use UBlock for is to hide certain website elements that are just visual clutter.

The Element Zapper makes them go away, at least until the page refreshes. This has happened on multiple sites, so I do not believe it to be a site-specific issues.

The main page banner ad is particularly annoying, as it appears to be loading behind everything where I can't see it but can hear it. Actually, it might be possible that ublock is not working at all, but I can't tell that for sure because most ad services are blocked by my hosts file before ublock ever gets a chance to interact with them. Either way, something is broken, and now I'm bombarded by the most annoying ads on the web.

Dear developers, Nowadays website layouts are optimized to display ads and teasers. I use "block element" for each unwanted element in header/footer/side panels. End result - huge empty margins. This is much better than ads, but can still be improved. Desired features for "preview/bock/pick/quit" panel: * Add button "Only show selected" that hides everything BUT selected and sets margins/padding of outer containers to zero. Use case: select the only relevant pane in one click and maximize the pane. * Add controls to toggle "show/hide/highlight" and to unblock unblock elements affected by user defined filters. Use case: restore accidentally blocked element.

This is intentional. If you want to create a permanent filter, you need to use the Picker.

I tried playing a few 60fps videos and didn't have issues, thus I can't test a solution. However, here is my best guess: There are two possible factors: added network latency and added resource load. The second is less likely, but easier to test: try disabling cosmetic filtering for YouTube. The network latency is more likely, but a tiny bit harder (for you as a user) to fix. Consider creating an exception filter for your specific case: exception would circumvent larage portions of uBlock Origin filter matching pipeline and thus would avoid latency cased by waiting for many memory-reads. Overview of uBlock's network filtering engine: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Overview-of-uBlock's-network-filtering-engine The rest of the docs are great too, so try reading them.

What do you mean by a WordPress plugin? What exactly do you need to do specifically? WordPress is a tool for creating web-sites (server-side) and any ad-blocker is for preventing network activity on already created web-sites (client-side). If you own a web-site, simply analyze which components (dependencies) cause the unwanted activity and remove them or adjusts their settings. If you are a user of a web-site, uBlock Origin does not care which tools it was created with (WordPress or anything else), so in case of a problem you should report specific problem to list maintainers. If you still have questions, post at official uBlock Origin sub-Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/.

It is troubled if "marsflag.com" is registered in the EasyPrivacy filter list. e.g. https://www.sii.co.jp/en/

My first response was cut short, so here is the rest: For example, EasyList contains rule /adverts/, which matches location of most of your images www.sustainable-properties-forsale.com/adverts/*, so you should contact EasyList maintainers asking to create an exception. Alternatively, since pattern "adverts" is likely to show up in almost any ad blocking list, you could rename the folder and likely avoid the problem altogether.
-------------------------
filter
This is external filter issue (most likely EasyList). Please use the Logger to identify the problematic rules and report them to maintainers: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger Specifically, your images are located at http://www.sustainable-properties-forsale.com/adverts/* and EasyList has rule /adverts/ which matches them. You could try to contact EasyList maintainers to add an exception rule, or simply change the image addresses to, say, /images/* (since /adverts/* is "screaming" to be blocked by ad blockers). Note: This might not be the only rule affecting your website, but images load for me once I disable it.

This is intentional (limitations of Yandex Android Browser API). Yandex Android Browser does not allow network filtering directly (does not have API for that), but instead allows extensions to register filters with it and then it will enforce these filters on its own. Therefore it requires special version of ad blocker (more accurately, merely a filter list manager), such as "Adguard Content Blocker" (not regular AdGuard) or "Adblock Fast" or something like that. More details: https://yandex.com/support/browser-mobile-android-tablet/useful-features/api-for-ad-blockers.html#switch-on-off DISCLAIMER: I did not ever use neither of "Adguard Content Blocker" nor "Adblock Fast" and thus can not recommend either of them.

Ublock is no longer working for message boards hosted on Boards2go.com. Normally (without any adblocking software) B2g will show a medium-sized banner at the top of each page. However, I and several other users believe that B2g and/or their ad supplier have enabled a malicious script to bypass adblocking software. Whenever you have your adblocker turned on (and we've tried it with multiple ones), the normal ad banners are replaced by larger, very intrusive banners that are sometimes borderline pornographic - sometimes multiple on the same page so that they take up the whole screen. This issue started some time ago and for a while Ublock was the only adblocker capable of hiding them and keeping them hidden. However, it seems the malicious ads have upped their game and Ublock is no longer able to keep them gone. I've tried different settings and filters and nothing works! Please, PLEASE fix this - these ads make the site nearly unusable. My site has used B2g for 9 years and if this continues we will have to consider the time-consuming hassle of switching to another host. (Other info: I use Chrome version 63.0.3239.132 but this issue seems to happen regardless of browser)

TL;DR: If you hate any kind of telemetry or are a pro-user and know what words "[software] community" mean, you want uBlock Origin. Also, uBlock Origin might occasionally break, especially if you use an unusual Chromium variant. If you want a slightly worse but a very consistent experience in any browser and are willing to compromise some of your privacy in exchange, Adblock Plus might be better for you. In the later case, I'd recommend looking into AdGuard -- a commercial company offering technical support help desk, but with a different financial model: getting money from users, not advertisers. (You may choose to pay for the product, and are guaranteed that you won't become the product.) Their browser extension is free, while the revenue comes from selling "advanced" licenses to users for standalone computers and mobile programs implementing features impossible for an extension. So they do need to sell your privacy to advertisers, and instead rely on money paid by some users. For example, I personally bought lifetime license for Android to have DNSCrypt (encrypted DNS) and I'm really happy with it. Also, both block pretty much the same ads, since all adblockers just follow instructions specified by the filter lists you choose and all lists are maintained by volunteers external to either project, except for Acceptable Ads (maintained by Eyeo GmbH). There are some differences due to uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus having slightly different syntaxes, but most rules are compatible with either one. Adblock Plus is a commercial product from a very financially successful company (its developer Eyeo GmbH pulls in revenue in hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Acceptable Ads, while employing about 100 people). On the other hand, uBlock Origin is completely non-commercial hobby project by a very talented individual (Raymond Hill) in his free time, who believes any financial activity might eventually compromise the primary objective (protect user choice and privacy), and thus does not even have a dedicated website or forum to avoid any financial activity. Adblock Plus offers consistency and limitations of a mass-market commercial product (and takes a bit of your privacy in return, even if you disable Acceptable Ads). uBlock Origin offers complete privacy and is more efficient (from my personal experience and according to all articles online I could find), but if you have a question, you'll go to the user community (a topic on Reddit) and you might be expected to read documentation. Here is some stuff I'd really recommend reading: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Why-don't-you-accept-donations%3F Privacy Policies: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Privacy-policy https://adblockplus.org/en/privacy

Did you disable cosmetic filtering?
-------------------------
filter
Thank you for the reply. I'm not sure if we're talking about the same thing. I added several sites to "my filters", so the filter is present, and instead of silently blocking them, uBlock Origin returns the strict blocking page with the exclamation mark in the orange triangle and the text: uBlock Origin has prevented the following page from loading: ... Because of the following filter ... Found in: My filters Go back Disable strict blocking for ... Temporarily Permanently I don't want this notification, I want strict blocking to do its thing silently. If we are talking about the same thing, the necessity to report each and every site I intend to block is very counter productive, and I don't understand why it is required at all, if I already have the custom filter in my own rules.

Popup tabs/windows are blocked only when there is a matching popup filters. If you get the document-blocked tab/window, and it does not close itself, it's because there is no popup filters, you need to report to filter list maintainers so that they add a popup filter. Other blockers also require the popup filter, but in their case they would load the content instead of blocking it like uBO.

uBlock is installed in Chrome on Win7 PC. I was unable to link to a zoom.us video meeting in Chrome, where the video window should appear. After hours with Zoom Tech Support, unsuccessfully reinstalling their launcher, etc., finally I manually updated my Win7 registry HKEY_CLASSES with the required zoom settings, and it started working fine! Question: Is the uBlock Chrome extension preventing these registry changes when new software is installed (or updated) via Chrome? If so, for future reference, is there a way to whitelist a site to allow registry updates? John Chamberlain Waco, TX USA

Shortly: To disable uBO on a particular domain, click on UO shield on the right of the search/address bar and in the menu that appears click on large ON/OFF blue button. https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface By default, uBO is in "allow by default" mode thus blocks only stuff that was deemed untrustworthy, therefore I'd recommend being cautious about what you download (e.g. make sure it is a PDF, not executable disguised as a PDF). However, false positives are possible, so if you have time, you could use the Logger to find the false positive filter and then inform the filter list maintainers about it. https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger

How do I tell uBlock to whitelist an extension and stop it interfering with behaviour that I need in that extension? Cannot keep uBlock unless there's a way because it's causing problems with my password manager and email masking extension, Blur.
-------------------------
filter
What is the exact problem you have? uBlock Origin should not interfere with anything -- it only does what you tell it to do (block specific requests and hide specific elements). Here are my GUESSES what you might have: 1. Extensions [something] failed to redirect request to [something]. This happens when you just installed an extension and Chrome did not inform other extensions of this change. Solution: restart Chrome. 2. uBlock Origin hides something of Blur Solution: Open the logger and see what is going on, add a white-list for the problem. 3. uBlock Origin injects a script that interferes with Blur Open the logger and see what is going on, add a white-list for the problem. 4. uBlock Origin blocks Blur's network requests. Probably, Blur makes behind-the-scenes network requests (if it is an extension and not merely a link to a web app). uBlock Origin can filter behind-the-scenes requests, but it is not a default behavior. If it does, you had checked option "I am an advanced user" with a link to "required reading". Solution: If so, you are using a very powerful feature that does require some knowledge... so read the required reading.

Yes, you can block whatever you want. Just open the logger and see which rules you want to keep and which you do not want. If you want to block only YouTube ads, disable all filter lists on the Dashboard and paste the desired filters in the "My filters".

Unfortunately, I'm not a mind reader, so I can provide only generic advice: 1. Did you enable Spanish filter lists in the Dashboard? 2. There is a Mozilla forum for this kind of support (please search for a post about your problem before posting and provide enough details to let others help you): https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/support-ublock-origin/6746 3. uBlock does not maintain Spanish filter lists (uBO has a few filters, but they are mostly for fixing problems in the included third-party filters)

But I will add appropriate anti-blocker-foiling filters only for sites which make use of the anti-blocker, not the site which demonstrates/publishes the anti-blocker code. There is no value in foiling the anti-blocker on this site, other than for silly bragging value, which will more than likely attract the attention of the author of the anti-blocker code, possibly encouraging the code to be revised, which would then force me to revise the anti-blocker foiling code.

This would make a tremendous difference. It's very inconvenient to make custom filters on tons of websites if you just want to temporarily pause Ublock.

UBlock has been working wonderfully well until now. Recently, Indian Express newspaper, http://indianexpress.com/ started demanding that I unblock their ads and would not allow me to visit their site. So, I stopped visitng their site. Today, their news item appeared on Google news, I clicked on it and there I see the page flloded with ads; UBlock failed to block their ads. Seems they were able to hack uBlock filter. I checked UBlock filter and it appeared non-functional! Lookks like Indian Express s/w disabled the uBlock. Can you fix this issue? You cann go to their website and test your product. Up until now, UBlock functioned outstandingly.

Hi, I keep running into scenarios where uBlock Origin is blocking wanted actions, for example popups for legitimate sites. I get no warnings or notifications (that I can see), so it feels like I am just clicking a link and getting nothing. Is there a way to relax the restrictions whiteout whitelisting or entirely turning off blocking for a site, but still let wanted behaviors through? The latest example is from Huckberry which unfortunately is a member site and I don't expect you to sign up and see. The behavior happens on their referral link where a popup appears and you enter a friend's email to send them an email. Thanks.

Works fine here using default settings. This could be caused by: - You enabled one or more 3rd-party filter lists, and one of them contains a problematic filter. If so, report to the maintainers of the filter list. - You created a custom filter which causes this. Use the logger, it will tell you why the tab was closed. When a tab is closed by uBO, it is reported in the logger as a "popup" type, along with the filter which caused this. The logger is the first thing to look at to diagnose issues.

I can whitelist the site and it will run fine but any YouTube video that isn't whitelisted gives the same error. Note that after the first 15 - 30 seconds (or the length of the ad that was supposed to run) the video refreshes and runs fine. However if you refresh yourself, it simply restarts the counter and you're forced to wait the length of the ad all over again.

With the same filter lists, uBO will block as well as other blockers, -- actually better since it can also block popunders.

Those inline popups are DOM-based, they are not created through a standard browser API, unlike the window-based popups.

Filters are out of date most of the time. They have the yellow "out of date" next to the filters. I wonder why they bother reporting it instead of just updating it themselves. I read somewhere that filters supposedly autoupdates every 4 days, however I don't know if it is working properly. How does it even keep track? What if you don't use the computer/browser everyday? At my friend house, it seems that ublock filters have been "out of date," most of the time. It seems Ublock doesn't know how "out of date" the filters actually are b/c the Chrome profile i set up is rarely used, sometimes weeks go in between usage if I am staying over at her house and using her computer. I know my filters may be weeks old, but ublock rarely autoupdates them. Does ublock updates every 4 days of browser usage, not whether the filters are more than 4 days old? I guess it isn't a big problem yet, as long as the addon block what it is supposed to and the addon is still awesome, but filter autoupdate mechanism may not be working correctly.
-------------------------
filter
When I do a manual updates it works, so I don't think anything is blocking network requests. At home, it isn't a problem b/c I use Chrome almost every day and the mechanism works like advertised for my main Chrome profile. However, my rarely used guest profile for anybody other than me has the same out of date issue. The filters could be weeks out of date, but Ublock won't autoupdate them until I it seems I use the profile for at at least 4 consecutive days? So I guess ublock auto updates filters after 4 days of browser usages not whether or the filters are more than 4 days old?

uBO does not open a new tab, the browser does. uBO blocks the fetching of the document though for that new tab if there is a matching filter. You then chose to proceed or not. The ability to block the whole document is a feature specific to uBO. Other blockers will load the page even if there is a filter for it. This uBO feature is called "strict blocking": https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface#no-strict-blocking It is especially useful when a site tries to open nuisance or even malware site -- uBO will prevent the connection to even be made.

UBlock Origin will slow down page loading speed guaranteed. Proof: visit any page and load up Devtools > Network. Page resource timing is noticeably skewed. It happens on whitelisted sites, too.

It doesn't happen when "Parse and enforce cosmetic filters" is disabled. The problem started not so long ago, after one of the updates.

There is no way for uBO to decide on its own that a specific DOM element is undesirable and must be removed from view. This is a job for filter list maintainers. There are two filter lists in there which purpose is to take care of these warnings, you should select them. The Reek's one has special instructions which you should follow if you want to use it. For any instances which is not taken care by these lists, this needs to be reported to the maintainers so that they can add the proper filters.

I don't have any "wonderful work" on uBlock Origin, I'm just a user. Raymond Hill is the author. I don't know all the details about lists, but: - it is obvious that if some checked list show "0 used of XXXX" you can un-check it (because all lines in it are already present in some other list) - I don't think you will see any slowdown if you keep redundant lists checked - I think uBlock Origin will use the same amount of RAM and CPU during browsing. The only little slowdown may be at browser start - and you can try to measure it several times with many lists checked and then with only Fanboy+Easylist-Merged checked.

Hi, My apologies if this question/topic has already been disused, I've tried to find, but I couldn't. Please answer to the next three questions. I will number them to be easier for you to answer: 1. Referring to used hardware resources (CPU) which of the above two alternatives is better to use: -All Fanboy lists + All EasyLists OR - Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List 2. Referring to number of blocking lines which alternative of the two ones is more often updated and have more blocked lines? -All Fanboy lists + All EasyLists OR -Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List ? 3. Is it better to use both of the two alternatives regarding the first two questions? Thank you very much.
-------------------------
filter
Best is to use Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List, because it will require only a single read operation to fetch the filter list. This list is updated as often as all the component filter lists, so not an issue. No point in using both alternative,, uBO will discard duplicate, which means it will work uselessly at load time to merely discard half the filters (the duplicates).

I'm pretty sure this is a feature in ABP, so it would be nice to see in uBlock Origin: Whitelisting specific YouTube channels.

I tried a few pages and I do not see this behavior (using default settings/lists). When blocking resources from a site, this may cause side effects on web pages, and it's probably what you are experiencing. Whether there are side effects and what they are depends directly on how the site is designed, what is being blocked, and this itself depends on what filter lists and rules are in effect.

The only way to stop this is to create an exception filter to counter the filter in EasyPrivacy which blocks the network requests responsible for the counter forever going up. Use the logger to find out which filter is responsible for this, and counter it using a static filter, or a dynamic URL filter.

uBlock has access to the whole DOM of web pages (all blockers acting at DOM level do), so yes, it has access to that information. uBlock does not lookup that information though, its only purpose is to hide DOM elements which match cosmetic filters, or to collapse placeholders of blocked resources.

"Do not track" does not disable tracking, "Do not track" is about you asking those who have an interest in tracking you to not track you. I personally do not believe we should ask trackers to not track us. Best is to not connect to trackers' servers, and this is accomplished through using the proper filter lists. EasyPrivacy is the most useful and it is selected by default. There are more 3rd-party filter lists which can be selected, your choice. Ultimately, default-deny scripts/frame does wonder, but one has to be ready to "fix" web sites, to find and unblock only what is necessary for a web site to function properly.

@Raymond Hill Reading your response and the quick-guide I think I have a better understanding of how the strict blocking works. I must admit I didn't really consider the security part. As I live in south america I never get things blocked because of malware, but privacy/advertisement. For me uBlock/adblock is only a performance/convenience tool, and because of that I don't get many problems from allowing anything referred from whitelisted websites. Also, I wanted this mainly for bato.to where they recently implemented popups and indicated that they wouldn't work if using an ad blocker ( https://bato.to/forums/topic/22649-changed-ad-format-for-webtoonweb-comic-display-to-popups/). Given that bad ads there are removed quickly ( https://bato.to/forums/topic/18106-annoying-ads-v3/ ) I though there would be no problems whitelisting bato.to. I understand now tough that what I wanted does not seem feasible. Anyway, I thank you for your response and your work with the extension.

We need to clarify the terms here. When you say uBlock "prompts", you are certainly referring to strict blocking, which means you are navigating to a page which matches a filter. Popups are a different thing, uBlock never warns for popups. So I am going to guess you are asking if strict blocking can be disabled for when a blocked document is opened from a *specific site*. The answer is no, because that makes no sense to assume that all the links on a given site can all be trusted. I can't think of a scenario of where this would make sense. There is always a compromise between convenience and security, and in that case I won't compromise security for convenience, as I can't even think of a sensible scenario where this would make sense. All the sites in malware domain lists do not become suddenly all trustworthy because links to these malware sites sit on a site you trust.

You are very fast, I see you already added some code to monitor iframe changes :) (I don't pretend to understand the code) In last days I added some cosmetic filters but they change the page often. Your arenabg.com##iframe[data-src] is much better. When a new version of uBlock Origin 'comes to me' I will disable this cosmetic filter (by !) to see how the new code acts. I have BGR list checked and + 3 lines in 'My filters' all adds are gone now: ||cdn.arenabg.ch/var/assets/banners/ ||cdn.arenabg.ch/share/images/banners/ arenabg.com##iframe[data-src] Thanks!

Actually, this cosmetic filter is probably even better: arenabg.com##iframe[data-src] As it appears the iframes which are problematic always have this "data-src" attribute.

What are your selected filter lists? Also, any custom filter?
-------------------------

uBlock uses third-party filter lists. You will have to find out what filter list is responsible for the issue and report to the maintainers of that filter list.

That's not normal. You could try to purge EasyList, and force a new download of it: - Go to the "3rd-party filters" pane in the dashboard - Click the purge button aside EasyList - Click "Update now" If this does not work, You need to be sure that yo do not have custom settings/filters/rules that interfere with the proper functioning of uBlock. uBlock with out of the box settings does block ads on Youtube.

Not much difference -- maybe this will change in the future. Both perform just the same. I still contribute and will keep contributing important bug fixes to the other (or important core filtering engine functionality if needed).

You exception filter should work fine if you pasted it to the "My rules" pane, not the "Whitelist" pane. The "Whitelist" pane is to completely disable uBlock on certain sites.

I need more details. Key is for you to give me all details for me to reproduce the problem on my side. Best is to file issue on Github: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues At first glance it looks to me like a filter issue, i.e. you would have the same problem with ABP + EasyList + EasyPrivacy + Peter Lowe's. All these filter lists are 3rd-party to uBlock.

There are hard limitations, due to space limits on sync account.

Ok, it's because the site is using a domain name which is not filtered by EasyList yet, so that popup doesn't get blocked. Try this custom filter (without quotes): "||ad132m.com^$popup" For popups to be blocked, there needs to exist a filter to block it. So when advertizers create new domain names for their popup, these new ones do not get blocked until a filter is added in EasyList. It's actually for this reason that the next version of uBlock will have a popup blocker which will block all popup unconditionally for a give site: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface#no-popups So that will take care of all this without waiting for EasyList.

uBlock is more strict because more filter lists are selected by default. I looked into the issue for wistv.com, and indeed, an entry in the list "Peter Lowe's" was blocking a resource needed by the site for proper playback. To fix the issue, a new version of uBlock's own filters is available, and this should show in the "3rd-party filters" pane. If it doesn't show that there is a new version available, restart uBlock, then you should be able to see it, and update it. Another way is to un-select "Peter Lowe's", this will make uBlock less strict and closer to how ABP behaves.

uBlock does not support the `document` filter option. The purpose of that filter option is to disable completely uBlock for a given site. In uBlock, you must explicitly disable uBlock yourself for a given site, it cannot be done through filters. What you can do is take entries in the file and create a whiltelist directives out of them, which you can paste into the Whitelist pane in uBlock's dashboard: this will disable uBlock for the sites. Example, and entry found in the file: @@||uggaustralia.7eer.net^*$xmlhttprequest,subdocument,document,script,object,image,~third-party,stylesheet Equivalent whitelist directive: uggaustralia.7eer.net

As said on the front page of the project, uBlock is not an "ad blocker", so not everything which is blocked is an "ad". EasyPrivacy is enabled by default in uBlock. Because of EasyPrivacy, uBlock by default will also block trackers/analytics. When you play a Youtube video, there are recurrent network requests which are blocked because of filters in EasyPrivacy. If you use EasyPrivacy in Adblock Plus, you will get the same exact result.

Like they say in link, something tampered with your Chrome installation. Maybe Microsoft Essential did this. uBlock ships with filter lists as part of the package, including malware domains lists, so it appears this often results in false positive from anti-viruses and other such tools.

It would be better to have µBlock update filters every day, rather than every 4 days. In my experience, when reports of EasyList breaking a site reach its maintainers, they fix it immediately. There's no reason to have us wait 4 days to get these updates.
-------------------------
list
> There's no reason to have us wait 4 days to get these updates Yes there is a reason: server bandwidth. There is no reason to need an update if you do not required the fix on your side, i.e. if the fix is for a site which you do not visit. To constantly download from a remote server incurs a cost to whoever is maintaining that server. uBlock is not a critical tool like an anti-virus, so it's not critical to not have the absolute latest version of any list. Think of the ones who are making the lists for free, on servers which they are funding at no cost to you. If anything, I need to make uBlock even more gentle to these remote servers (which I will).

It's normal, there is a filter in EasyPrivacy which blocks these Youtube net requests collecting stats which occurs at interval when playing a video on Youtube. The count on the badge is absolutely not detrimental to the browser performance, it just tells the truth about the number of net requests which were blocked. You can rest assured that whatever "1 second" delay you experience when you press stop, it's completely unrelated to uBlock, as uBlock *does not do anything special internally* when you press the stop button. If this still bother you, you can create an exception filter to override the EasyPrivacy filter in order for the requests to not be blocked: "@@||s.youtube.com^" (without the quotes). But my advice is keep the filter, it's part of EasyPrivacy for a reason. The number on the badge is for information purpose, whether the count is low or high has no bearing on uBlock's performance.

I get same result with Adblock Plus, so it's a filter lists problem. EasyList et al. are third-party to uBlock, meaning someone else maintains these lists. You need to report to these maintainers the problem. Now regarding "custom filter does not work either", I checked and you are right. I found out that there are exception filters in EasyList to actually prevent them from being removed. This means your custom filters will be overriden by the exception in EasyList. Why these exceptions were created is something you will have to ask EasyList crew. However uBlock currently supports a filter option to prevent any exception from overriding a block filter: "important". So this works: ||kissanime.com/ads/sideskins/$important For http://www.dramago.com/, it's not clear to me what needs to be blocked, I don't see obvious ads, but it's likely a filter problems again, as often said, uBlock will behave same as ABP with exact *same* filter lists.

This was actually happening with ABP too, which is why I switched to ublock in the first place. Occasionally, it will hang on a web page forever saying "waiting on extension ublock..." until I disable/re-enable in. That's pretty annoying, and I would like if it stopped. I'm guessing, since it was both ABP and UB, that it's a list thing, maybe?

I did experienced this once, and restarting the browser (Chromium) fixed the problem. I don't know, it seems sometimes the browser, after running for a very long-time without restarting it can become in some unstable state. uBlock is non-blocking internally, and it's pretty fast at handling its job, so when this happen it more than likely the browser is in a bad state. What is your computer? What the filter count in use as show by uBlock on the "3rd-party filters" tab? I was using a poor 8-year old laptop for the last month, and I could see once in a while "Waiting for uBlock", but that was rare, and I never saw a page hang with "Waiting for uBlock". (I could not run ABP on that laptop, all page load became quite sluggish and laptop fan kicked in high speed all the time).
-------------------------

Looks to me that uBlock was removed from your computer. I've heard that some anti-virus can do this (Avast?). uBlock ships with the filter lists, and these filter lists -- especially the malware filter lists -- may contain text which an antivirus doesn't like. Just a guess. But definitely your uBlock installation was broken by something. Try reinstalling, and if it happens again, you will have to figure what is messing with the extension's installation.

Any single net request which is blocked adds to the counter. You can confirm this by opening the developer console. Specifically in the case of Youtube, I see net requests regularly blocked while playing a video, net requests which URL starts with "https://s.youtube.com/api/stats/...". This happens because of a filter in EasyPrivacy: "||s.youtube.com^".

I've noticed that on thepiratebay.se, the EasyList filter hides certain elements that are actually useful, such as removing the hyperlinks to the uploader name and for adding a comment. Could you write me an exception line that I can add to the "Your filters" section of Ublock that specifically disables the EasyList filter only on thepiratebay.se domain? Also, if it's not too much to ask, could you write another line that applies the "EasyList without element hiding rules" filter ONLY to thepiratebay.se? Thanks in advance :)

Filter syntax: https://adblockplus.org/en/filter-cheatsheet I do not write filters, neither filter lists, except those needed for github issue #17.

What browser/version? What URL did you try it on (just to confirm it works for me with same case)? What entries do you have in the whitelist tab in uBlock's dashboard?

I don't have Chrome OS so that will be difficult for me to figure what is interfering. When you say "typing a search phrase in the URL area doesn't work", do you mean a search is not launched once you press <Enter>? What are the selected filter lists? Do you have custom filters? Are there dynamic filters being active? Is the problem also occurring with ABP?
-------------------------
filter
To configure uBlock, click on the title bar of the drop-down menu. The bottom section is dynamic filtering: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering.

Example real world use case: I want to use a cash back site's filter list temporarily: http://www.ebates.com/whitelist/ebates-cash-back-shopping.txt and then when done shopping switch that whitelist off.

Add these to your custom filters: "@@||b.scorecardresearch.com^$domain=www.expansion.com" and "@@||metrics.el-mundo.net^$domain=www.expansion.com", without the quotes. These are to override filters in EasyPrivacy (same problem with ABP + EasyPrivacy). I put exceptions in uBlock's filter lists, so maybe forcing an updating will work -- after purging the cache for "µBlock filters".
-------------------------
filter
I tried all the links in there, including clicking on thumbnails and it worked fine. Can you give me a specific link which does not work for you? Also, what filter lists do you have selected?
-------------------------
filter
Ok, these two filters are needed: "@@||scorecardresearch.com^$domain=www.tiramillas.net" and "@@||el-mundo.net^$domain=www.tiramillas.net"
-------------------------
filter
This filter seems to fix the problem: "@@||scorecardresearch.com^$domain=www.tiramillas.net" (without quotes)
-------------------------

I just checked and what you describe is consistent with disabling 1st-party javascript. Dynamic filtering is for users who understand the consequences of blocking javascript, suitable for users who would install NoScript in Firefox.

Need to add this filter to "Your filters": "@@||intergi.com^$domain=tvgolo.com" (without the quotes). I added it to uBlock's filters.

Sorry, a typo in config file caused the lists to not be seen anymore. I missed this one at testing as the config file was loading from cache.
-------------------------
filter
Strike that, blocking 3rd-party scripts doesn't fix the problem. So it has to be the two filters I gave you. I will notify EasyPrivacy maintainers so that they include the fix in the official list.

-------------------------

How about you give me a test case which I can use to reproduce the problem you are reporting? One specific URL would be much more constructive. uBlock parses and enforces EasyList et al. If there exists no filter for a specific popup, it won't obviously block it, and this needs to be reported to the maintainers of EasyList.
-------------------------
filter
Actually I just did a search for 'yontoo' in the filter lists which ship with uBlock, and there are filters in there related to 'yontoo' in EasyList and hpHosts. So probably TSM Adware just make a raw string search, find the string 'yontoo' and report this.
-------------------------
filter
I get the same problem with Adblock Plus (using same filter lists). I found that "ge.tt" appears in a list from malwaredomains.com, so this means for some reasons the site is considered as hosting malware. If you want to enable the site use a custom exception filter: "@@||ge.tt^", as I can't for obvious reasons unblock this site for everybody.
-------------------------

I am reading-tracing carefully the code to see what it would cause net requests to be all allowed, and one thing I forgot to ask is what you have in your whitelist?
-------------------------
whitelist
*** 1) Is an open issue in Github (#40) *** 2) Element picker (slashed eye icon in pop-up) *** 3) Not sure... You mean what the big green button accomplish? *** 4) and 5) Supported, though there is no UI (you have to enter in whitelist). Ctrl+click on button will whitelist the current page, so you can go to whitelist and add an asterisk at the end
-------------------------
filter
Yes, this has been reported often times. Problem is the browser, by design, can't guarantee that extensions will be fully ready before loading tabs, i.e. extensions can't prevent the browser from loading tabs. So when uBlock launches, it has to load all filters etc, i.e. it needs to do a lot of work before being ready to block ads, but then the browser won't wait or even ask extensions whether they are ready before loading the tabs, it loads the tabs asap after launching the extensions. Improving load performance should help, and this was done with version 0.5.0.0+, which I wish to publish as soon as uBlock get out of "pending review" mode (I am currently not allowed to update it). From there, will see what else I can do to improve further load time, but still, this depends a lot on the amount of lists used, whether "Auto update" is selected, etc. As long as the browser opens tabs without waiting for extensions to be ready this is going to be a recurring problem.

If you go to this page: http://www.tampabay.com/news/world/kiev-issues-warning-as-russian-convoy-heads-for-rebel-areas/2193070 Below the headline and above the text of the newspaper's story, is a rectangular grey area, and if ublock is not active, will show a video. How do I whitelist just this video? In general, how do I whitelist any one element on a page when ublock is active?
-------------------------
filter
I've been playing a video for 40 minutes now, and the memory footprint of the extension stands at 51MB (Chromium 64-bit with all filter lists selected except regional ones), which is typical given I have forced a reload of the filters by changing my custom filters on top of all this. What other extensions do you have installed? The browser's garbage collector make take longer to kick in when the browser is not idle enough. So if some other extensions are causing higher CPU usage, the browser won't fall into idle mode, and the garbage collector will become lazier. Currently my CPU stands at 5% for the Youtube tab, which seems sufficient for the garbage collector to kick in. Do you have the request log enabled?

I use OKCupid, and whenever you use any sort of extension that blocks ads, they put up this image with a message begging you to donate $5, and it takes up most of the right side of the screen. I imported a filter I used in AdBlock that blocked it, but those turds at OKCupid keep finding a way around it. Is there anything that you guys at uBlock can do to filter this out? It's a really bad eyesore, and it's advertising in my book that I have NEVER whitelisted.
-------------------------
filter
OKCupid is using a random id, so filters need to go around this. I find this one works: "okcupid.com###body_wrapper > #wrapper.clearfix.full_width > #page.grid_16 > div > div:nth-of-type(1) > div > div" (without the quote, cut & paste in 'Your filters'). But given how OKCupid is determined for users to see the pledge (using random element ids), they could also easily go around this one if they want -- and causes the site to break even for people using such filter. Maybe I or someone else can think of something better.
-------------------------
filter
It would be really great if I could add a filter like this: http://adblock.sander85.com/list.php

Ok, you meant the URL points to a filter list, I thought you meant to use literally the URL as a filter itself. The list imported just fine. I get "321 used out of 325". You need to click "Apply changes" at the top after you imported the list URL.
-------------------------
list
When using ublock with httpsb. I'm still confuse as to what list to keep checked on httpsb. Do you mean anything above spam404 I can check on? Also what happens if those list above spam404 are already checked on ublock? Do they conflict?
-------------------------
filter
You can check everything above Spam404. Spam404 and everything below is mostly Adblock Plus filtering, so if you disable ABP filtering, it's not very useful to load and parse these lists. There is no harm in having the same hosts-based lists selected in both uBlock and HTTPSB, except that selecting the malware domains lists in uBlock is probably overkill, as it is already very unlikely that these domains are going to be hit, and if ever it happens, HTTPSB does a better job at blocking these since it blocks the whole page from downloading, not just its secondary content.
-------------------------
filter
That would be <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/108>. Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed fix for this one, the browser doesn't wait for extensions to fully load before opening a tab, by design. There might be extensions out there which purpose is to manage tabs, and maybe one of them has a feature to prevent tabs from opening at launch unless you ask for it. I could try to inject content scripts into existing pages, but that would address only the cosmetic filters part (assuming this works anyways). That's the most I can do, here I created an issue for this so you can follow progress: <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/129>
-------------------------
list
It depends of the lists selected. EasyPrivacy, Peter Lowe's and known malware lists are enabled out of the box, so aside ads it also blocks trackers, analytics, malware domains.
-------------------------
list
Ir reports properly. The count depends on number of items blocked, which itself depends on what lists are selected. For the link you provide, I see 8 requests blocked (uBlock is a generic blocker, not an "ad" blocker, I find the disctinction important). If you want to find out what was blocked, go to the Statistics tab, and enable logging of blocked requests. Than you will be able to see exactly what requests were blocked.
-------------------------
filter
PageAction are for short-lived extension code. That would means each time a page load, uBlock would have to load and parse all filters, and then register an event listener for net requests -- at which point its probably too late, many of the requests have gone through for sure as mostly all is async in chrome API. This doesn't work for blockers, that's why none uses a PageAction.
-------------------------
filter
Yes, there is an open issue for this: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/70. I think I will add the workaround filter to uBlock's own list meanwhile. You can enter it yourself in your custom filters: "deviantart.com##.dp-ad-chrome.atf-right-300x250" (without the quotes)
-------------------------
filter
Thanks a lot for implementing my first proposal. Now, it's finally time to drop AdBlock, export my whole whitelist (quite big, as I have whitelisted many blogs and other smaller websites with unobtrusive, non-flash ads in order to support the site operators) and switch to your extension. Do you have any idea for a workaround that allow it to temporarily disable the filtering? Unfortunately I'm reliant on this quite regularly.
-------------------------
filter
It's a chromium-based browser issue: unfortunately there is no guarantee extensions will be up and running before page loads when launching the browser. Before uBlock can start blocking, it needs to load huge lists of filters, and this takes a while to complete, and the browser won't wait for an extension to finish whatever it's doing. It's by design in chromium.
-------------------------
whitelist
Regarding `@@||yoursite.com^$document`, the retained solution was to implement being able to whitelist a specific web page, or subset of a web page: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/0.3.2.0

A review after years of using it:

It is amazing and works great! But let me elaborate on that.

IF you don't know what you're doing, don't do it. I recommend reading the "manual" on github first, if you intend to highly customize it to your liking.

I did not know how to actually use it, for a veeeery long time... I did not know why ads were getting in, on pages and when watching videos(tv shows). And I added tons of custom filters to it, on top of its built-in filters, to force block them. Now, on top of making my PC very slow because of it, the ads were still popping up. And my PC is an R9 3950X with 32GB of RAM...
Well, in my defence, it's built-in filters were not that great in the beginning.

I was always complaining on github about stuff not working, and ending with the creator scolding me........ And everybody was always telling me to restore it to its default settings, use its built-in filters, and never play with the dynamic filters. I didn't understood why, and never listened, I was stubborn.

But this year finally I read the manual for it, and understood why nothing was working. And duh, it was my fault because I played with the dynamic filters when I didn't even know how exactly they work.
Then I restored it to its default settings and only used its built-in filters. And guess what, everything started working as advertised, with no issues. But to add, the built-in filters are way better than they used to be years ago. And more extension updates I guess.

So if people want to use it, I suggest reading its manual on github first. I promise a lot of confusion and things not working, will go away.

Also, this is not an AdBlocker. It may have some filters for blocking Ads, but it is a more advanced tool for blocking page elements and other stuff.

PS: Sorry @gorhill for being an idiot...
-------------------------

Overall great but I don't like that it blocks Honey by default and it's hard to stop it unless you just turn it off. It gives me the option to add to whitelist, so I choose that and it opens a page with a bunch of code and no other instructions. I figure it's good to go and it's still blocking honey. Would be nice if it made it more clear on how to whitelist chrome addons.
-------------------------
default
This addon has started to block mail.google.com email content section. Base installation, default settings, dozens of users reporting to our IT department the same issue.

thats now how this extension works it can only block adds also bing can be set as default search

You merely need to tell uBO that you want it to allow these resources. (They are blocked by default since most Internet users find these features overly privacy-intrusive.)
You can either:
- disable the privacy-related filters on the "3-rd Party Filters" pane (I don't recommend it, but this will fix all the social buttons everywhere): https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters
- whitelist specific resources on specific pages, for that refer to documentation (harder, but in my opinion wort the effort):
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki
-------------------------
default
uBO works with minimal site breakage with default settings/lists -- nothing has changed about this. If you add more lists or further customize it beyond basic settings/filters/rules, it will likely break more stuff. Also, do not use content blockers along uBO, they will likely interfere negatively with uBO's built-in counter anti-blocker filters.

Filter list maintainers constantly work on filter lists to address filtering issues, if you have any, please report to them, this is how those issues are addressed for all blockers, not just uBO (which also depends on 3rd-party lists).
-------------------------
default
I love this extension. It's my default ad blocker! However, since the last few days a lot of pages aren't loading anymore (soundcloud.com for example), or loading partially (linktr.ee sign-in page). When disabling the extension everything works perfectly. Chrome is updated to the latest version. I'm working on Mac. I'm forced to move to another extension while this issue lasts unfortunately. If this issue could be fixed I'll happily change my rating of course :)
-------------------------
default
Was great for years. Then this 'update' appeared at the end of June, and it's been nothing but pain and wasted time ever since. Yes, I've read the "release 1.28.0 notes". No, it does not solve the multitude of problems I now encounter daily across Websites I frequent. In fact, it's now faster and easier to simply turn uBlock completely off.

Addendum: with more experimentation, and starting from scratch (getting rid of YEARS of customized My Filters data), it's a much better experience, mostly due to simply disabling a number of the default Filter Lists that come with uBlock Origin. It seems to be that the combination of "old defaults" and "new block methods" were the crux of the problems I'd experienced. I'm constantly needing to add block rules to my 'new' My Filters & My Rules lists, but at least I don't have to endure what advertising majors call "the modern Web-browsing experience," full of crappy, annoying, MOVING ads, that track us across multitudes of sites.

I can't say whether starting from zero will fix anyone else's issues, but it's certainly worth a try if you've been using uBlock Origin for a very long time, and you've suddenly started having problems with uBlock since late June, making your browsing experience...let's say "irritating."
-------------------------
default
Pretty good adblocker with room for improvement.  While ublock does have the most stringent ad blocking it's a completely scorched earth product by default.  Unlike the original adblock there's not an easy way to operate in a blacklist mode instead of a whitelist mode (blacklist meaning ads are allowed unless you blacklist the site you are on at which point they are blocked).  .Ideally with one or two clicks it could be changed to a blacklist mode blocker.

The performance is good, and the amount of ads that are blocked is unrivaled.  Good product overall but I prefer the original adblock so I can allow more easily allow sites some ad revenue by default and only block them if their ads are obnoxious.
-------------------------
default
Seems UBlock won't work anymore by default unless you give it permission for it to work on a website. Such a shame it became like this. Regardless it still is a great blocker.


Edit: For some reason it defaulted to request permission first, a quick switch over to all sites and it's back to new.
-------------------------
default
ok, i just needed to "reset to default setting" and it fixed. so who will have my same issue in the future, it's all about reset the extension like default. Top app!
-------------------------

You should enable more filters (by default, extension uses the minimum number of filters that would benefit all the users):
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters

Best ad blocker ever it literally blocks everything on default :)
-------------------------

My default adblocker. It blocks with impunity.
-------------------------

So far this is my favorite adblocking app. Is there any way to have it "off' by default? As a web developer most of the day I need to turn it off, but don't feel like clicking into the chrome extension area to manually disable...?
-------------------------
default
This has helped me for a long time but I'm taking off a star because I believe that by default it deletes your cookies and forces you to log into every website again every time you restart your computer.  I disabled the "EasyPrivacy" filter and it seems to have solved the problem.  I'll edit this review if that turns out to be wrong.
-------------------------
default
Filters are powerful tools. The default ones should be ok for most people, and if it blocks stuff on a website where you don't want it to block anything, you can just whitelist the site.
-------------------------
default
You should probably turn off some of the filter lists. I used to have this problem so I deactivated the default filters and only use easylist and Peter Lowe's ad list. Since then I haven't had the issue.
-------------------------
default
You might need to manually update the filterlists, since they might go obsolete more often then the default automatic update period (5 days). I use only uBlock Origin and do not see any ads right now, but saw one a few days ago.
-------------------------
default
If ads come through, you simply should enable more filters.
uBO does not choose by itself what to block and what should be allowed, instead this is prescribed by filter lists. By default, uBO uses only the minimum number of filters beneficial to the most people and allows user to choose for themselves.
You can enable more filters on the "3-rd Party Filters" pane: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters

Thank You very very much!
Relevant Popups are rarely blocked per default and this can be customized via settings.

All the other stuff is gone!
e.g. my mailbox provider injects a lot of ads directly into the web ui for accessing my mailboxes. BUT: I'm using NO a free service - I'm paying for that...
And now: using uBlock and all is fine :)
-------------------------
default
Was okay for a while now I keep getting advertisement pop ups. Thought it was virus, but only got it in Chrome (when Firefox was default browser). I reinstalled windows 10 on my laptop but still got them (since on fresh install I put ublock again). 

I tried installing my chrome plugins one at a time per week, and after installing uBlock again, I got the pop ups. 

Definitely annoying - most of the time they were porn and I was scared to use my laptop in front of my Girlfriend!!!

Definitely do not recommend
-------------------------

This extension like every other adblocker I've come across only blocks, and is only capable of blocking, what you tell it to. If it's blocking too much for your liking then simply subscribe to less filter lists. You could also disable "generic cosmetic filtering" which you should notice making a real difference alone but again, at the end of the day, it's only blocking (or allowing) what you and every other user instructs it to. I would suggest taking a few hours out of an evening reading up on how to write filters to block ads dynamically, statically, and more relevant to your issue how to add exceptions (whitelisting). It's really not that difficult but the onus is on you to tell whatever blocker you use what to allow and what to block. You could even unsubscribe from every list meaning it won't block anything and use the new "zapper" feature which will block whatever elements you click on a page without creating any permanent rules but if you subscribe only to the filter lists you know you want and unsubscribe from the others, and disable generic cosmetic filtering (should be already done by default) you'll be good to go.  
-------------------------
default
The behavior of uBlock Origin is entirely defined by the filter lists you use (that's true for most other blockers too.) You can enable more filters in the settings (or subscribe for outside rules). If you want to find more filters, filterlists.com should help (disclaimer: I'm filterlists.com contributor).
Also, default settings + Russian filters work for me... so I don't know what ads you see. Although I have an idea: default lists might not include rules for adult sites (because they are not useful for most people).
-------------------------
default
uBlock Origin is incredibly effective at blocking ads. The most effective I have tried.

Unfortunately it is too aggressive with default settings.  It blocks  everything and will prevent many web services (like gmail) from working properly - and you won't quite know why unless you are cognisant of uBlock running in the background.

Ghostery is better at blocking ads without breaking services.
-------------------------
default
By default it blocks tracking and other things that is needed for websites to work, and many times I have to disable it to have website work.  That even included opening the payment page for my utility (electric) company.  The default should be blocking Ads only, while giving the user the option to block other items if they chose to.  Its default to blocking everything breaks many websites, and is terrible since I continuously have to disable it for websites that I need to use in order to use them.
-------------------------
default
Protects against malicious .JS attacks in default mode.
-------------------------
default
A bit more options than AdBlock, but by default install it and don't need to tweak it. So far, no scrollbar jumping around after the page loads, that was becoming super annoying with another adblocker.
-------------------------
default
All plugins don't run in incognito mode by default. This is a chrome security feature. You have to explicitly enable the plugin to run even in incognito mode.
-------------------------
default
It slows down video streaming on some sites, I suspect by blocking some streaming sources.

The "block and redirect" filter breaks the payment portion of Humble Bundle.

It's not the extension's fault, but some of the default filters are overzealous.
-------------------------
default
Tons of false positives. Going to banking sites or some web stores result in broken sites and failed logins simply because the defaults result in a lot of needed elements being suppressed. If you're looking for a adblocker that does a good job out of the box dont get this. It requires a bit of playing with the settings and making quite a few exceptions to get everything working well enough for daily use.
-------------------------
default
You can un-select filter lists if you wish: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-3rd-party-filters#. For reference, most other blockers come with only EasyList selected by default.

I am a web developer (who doesn't have ads) who has been hurt by uBlock.

I installed uBlock to block ads because it is more efficient that ABP.  But then I noticed that uBlock also blocks a ton of important web development tools such as crash reporters (bugsnag, newrelic) and even self-hosted webstats (piwik), which means that it makes it harder to ensure my website users have a quality experience.

Most people install ublock as an ad-blocker but do not realize (because it isn't clear) that it blocks nearly all third parties services, even if they are not related to serving ads.

A list of essential web development services blocked by uBlock by default include: bugsnag, newrelic, piwik,  optimizely, mixpanel, customer.io, and pingdom to name just a few.

As uBlock becomes the new normal, blocking essential web dev tools (that are not related to serving ads) by default is harmful to web developers such as myself.
-------------------------
default
Works great and low in resource usage.

It can be a little overzealous in its default configuration. Be sure to visit the Settings page and uncheck any lists you don't want used. For example, the Social blocking list may block some website functionality, so you may want to uncheck that one.
-------------------------
default
Please remove the default setting of blocking social media, not every techie is anti-social.

I cannot connect to a remote system with chrome remote desktop on my local network if uBlock origin extension is enabled. Using the uBlock Origin "disable on site" button does not fix the problem. After some searching, I found that this may be caused by blocking WebRTC. When I check Brave browser settings, changing WebRTC IP handling policy is grayed out and hovering over an extension icon (that only exists when uBlock origin is enabled) reveals the text "this setting is enforced by the 'uBlock origin' extension". However, the "Prevent WebRTC from leaking local IP addresses" is missing in the uBlock Origin settings tab. I read comments on Github that this option is disabled in uBlock Origin by default, but that does not seem to be the case. Please help.

My Google Chrome Crashed and my extensions are bad. I have repaired the EXTENSION it self but I have lost all my FILTER LIST DATA I need to get an USER Entry URL from the actual User files that contains all the entries for the Custom Imported Filter lists which are still in my system restore data entries for Windows. I cannot get it from "my-ublock-backup_2021-11-16_06.58.22.txt" Since it does not have it in there, the only way is manually going into the Working Directory of cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm, but I don't know how your extension is coded, I don't know anything about it only the fact of where the extension installed which is in the DEFAULT/EXTENSIONS/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm So my question to you is where in the working files do I need to go? I need the file name of where Ublock stores any URL information for Custom Imported Scripts There is no option to export or import the Filter Lists, the only way to restore and save that data is via the Settings restore from File / back up from file button. Windows 7 has all the cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm data stored in the Shadowcache which I have access to so I have multiple backups of 'Default' profile. So would cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm folder contain the USER Entered data as well? or do I need to go into another working directory of Google Chrome? If so please let me know which directories I should be looking into to find this data. Kind thanks, EJ

Nothing in google chrome is loading when the adblocker is turned on. I have reset my google chrome setttings to all default, which includes turning off all extensions, and my Chrome works.

I'd like uBo to function more like uMatrix, where disabling it on a site is only temporary unless you click the padlock icon to make it permanent. Often, a site won't work and, instead of fiddling with it, I'll just disable uBo to get it to work. The problem is, that adds it to the whitelist, and now it's always disabled on that site. I don't want it to be permanent by default, and I don't think it's a good idea for it to be, since I've been using uBo for a long time now and only just recently realized this, so a lot of the sites I've been going to have been unprotected, and I imagine many others have made the same mistake.

the other day 94-2020 i tried to compost an email and when i ltype a letter it always wutofilled the rest or offered suggestions this time it did not. i did tons of stuff to try and find out why, nothing helped. so last night i was using the chromebook and u block is not on that pc.well contacts were there. so this morning on my pc contacts wer gone. so i tired firefox browser and the contacts worked. so i started turning off the estentions. i have 4 running and ublock was the issue. i turn it off refresh and the contacts are there and work good. i turn ublock on and refresh and contacts do not even show. so was there an update or should i uninstall ublock origin and re install it? i think i will so it goes back to default but jsut in case that fails you may need to check out why. thanks

It seems to be blocking bbc.co.uk As the page loads a blocking message appears but then goes away and the page loads, eg try loading bbc.co.uk/weather. There are several mentions of bbc.co.uk in the default filter lists which I suspect are causing this problem. Perhaps one or more need removing ?

The only way I've found to watch videos, including and especially the live news broadcast on the WHIO ( https://www.whio.com/whio-tv/ ) website is to Allow w3.cdn.anvato.net within the uBO browser extension. My goal is to help make this viewable to all. I found the solution by becoming an "advanced user". Please make this allowable by default rules or filters in the next release. * Please note that many of us in the WHIO broadcast cannot receive a stable over-the-air television signal, and as such rely on the website to retrieve our news updates. If there is something I'm missing, please let me know at your earliest convenience. Thank you all so much for your hard work and dedication to this project! _

Hi, I appreciate this extension ALOT. Thank you. Is there a way to run uBlock OFF by default? As a webdev, sometimes I need to disable uBlock and it's a pain in the butt to manually do it every time I load a new page.

Any Wikia page I visit is significantly zoomed in for some reason, making everything unreadable. The Chrome zoom feature is set to the default when this happens, so that's not the issue. When the page loads, it appears normal for about a second before changing. Tried everything, but turning off Ublock was the only way to fix the issue. Would like a fix so I don't have to use the Chrome zoom feature to zoom out every individual Wikia page really far just to reach a normal, readable state.

Shortly: To disable uBO on a particular domain, click on UO shield on the right of the search/address bar and in the menu that appears click on large ON/OFF blue button. https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface By default, uBO is in "allow by default" mode thus blocks only stuff that was deemed untrustworthy, therefore I'd recommend being cautious about what you download (e.g. make sure it is a PDF, not executable disguised as a PDF). However, false positives are possible, so if you have time, you could use the Logger to find the false positive filter and then inform the filter list maintainers about it. https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger

What is the exact problem you have? uBlock Origin should not interfere with anything -- it only does what you tell it to do (block specific requests and hide specific elements). Here are my GUESSES what you might have: 1. Extensions [something] failed to redirect request to [something]. This happens when you just installed an extension and Chrome did not inform other extensions of this change. Solution: restart Chrome. 2. uBlock Origin hides something of Blur Solution: Open the logger and see what is going on, add a white-list for the problem. 3. uBlock Origin injects a script that interferes with Blur Open the logger and see what is going on, add a white-list for the problem. 4. uBlock Origin blocks Blur's network requests. Probably, Blur makes behind-the-scenes network requests (if it is an extension and not merely a link to a web app). uBlock Origin can filter behind-the-scenes requests, but it is not a default behavior. If it does, you had checked option "I am an advanced user" with a link to "required reading". Solution: If so, you are using a very powerful feature that does require some knowledge... so read the required reading.

I suggest that a default minimal blocking setting be made available as an alternative to shutting off all blocking on a site. I have encountered online services that offer a choice of paying a monthly fee to use their service, or turning off the adblocker. While I'm annoyed, with having to watch ads, that's not why I use an adblocker. I use an adblocker for the security of not having my machine exposed to third-party sites associated with ads that infect machines with spyware. I would love to be able to turn on ads for sites that demand to be supported by watching ads, while not exposing my machine to malware risks associated with unblocked ads.

Is there any way to block ALL popups by default? I know you can select "toggle the blocking of all popups on this site" from the flyout options, but I'd like this to default to "on" for all sites, and be toggled off by me, instead of vise versa. The popups I'm talking about are on blogs/news sites that popup after a few seconds with something "subscribe to our newsletter" or "join our mailing list" type crap.
-------------------------
default
Works fine here using default settings. This could be caused by: - You enabled one or more 3rd-party filter lists, and one of them contains a problematic filter. If so, report to the maintainers of the filter list. - You created a custom filter which causes this. Use the logger, it will tell you why the tab was closed. When a tab is closed by uBO, it is reported in the logger as a "popup" type, along with the filter which caused this. The logger is the first thing to look at to diagnose issues. The content 3rd-party filter lists or your own custom filters is outside the control of uBO.

I don't see any ads on dilbert.com using default filter lists. Be sure your filter lists are always up to date. Regarding the "Block element" tool, you can <Ctrl>-click an entry in the list to select only the current item instead of the long path of items.
-------------------------
default
From here all works fine as far as I can tell. I see only one resource blocked with up-to-date default filter lists. Force an update of your filter lists, see if this works. If not, I would need to know which filter lists aside the default ones, in order to reproduce the issue -- a necessary step to figure why the issue is occurring.
-------------------------
default
The site works fine here using default settings. So it's whether a filter list you enabled is causing an issue on the page, or another extension is causing this, or something else on your computer.
-------------------------
default
Just to be clear: if you permanently disable strict blocking for only "www.google-analytics.com" (this is the choice offered to you by default), uBO will still strict-block everywhere else.
-------------------------
default
I would need the URL of a specific web page to find out why this happens. The most likely explanation is that a filter from a 3rd-party filter list is interfering. I tried this link: https://secure-bananarepublic.gap.com/buy/shopping_bag.do And it worked for me using uBO's default settings. You may also try to report your issue with the maintainers of EasyList/EasyPrivacy (which uBO uses by default): https://forums.lanik.us/viewforum.php?f=64 You will also have to provide a URL if you want them to be able to investigate.
-------------------------
config
At install time: ABP/AdBlock: you need to go into config to *remove* "Acceptable ads", otherwise it really won't block much stuff. uBlock Origin: you *may* need to go into config to *add* whatever regional filter list(s) you may want. There is *no* "acceptable ads" to un-check. So to claim other blockers block more does not make much sense. In any case: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/747
-------------------------
default
Youtube ads are still blocked fine. Did you play with the settings in a way that caused uBO to no longer work for Youtube? There is a reset-to-factory-settings button in the _Settings_ pane in the dashboard, use it to reset uBO, it blocks Youtube ads with default settings.
-------------------------
default
You are still not providing *any* exact methodology/result figures, and whatever little information you provide flies in the face of common sense: To claim that "adblock" with default settings pages load faster than uBO with default settings is just complete nonsense. "Adblock" (whichever one you talk about) barely block anything with default settings, and the biggest factor which contributes to page load speed is all the bloat which is blocked. So to block less will always translate into slower page load. Also uBlock has ceased development months ago, and as such does not benefit any of the improvements brought into uBO, *including* performance improvement. So your claims is not only unsubstantiated, you keep stalling when asked for *details*, and your secret results/methodology make no sense and contradict findings from other sources, for example: https://www.raymond.cc/blog/10-ad-blocking-extensions-tested-for-best-performance/ At this point I can't conclude anything else than that you are trolling. Such statements as "reborn UBlock from you" supports that you are just trolling: uBlock Origin is the original uBlock as I envisioned it. Good trolling job, you got me to waste time to respond to you.

What are your filter lists?

Does or does uBlock block font downloads or not? I toggled "blocking of remote fonts on this website" and the F12 -> Resources tab showed 3 remote fonts for Yahoo mail both times. Also, why would I want to block fonts by default? The icon status for font blocking seems to be "on" by default.
-------------------------
default
I can only reply to myself here... You say font blocking is *disabled* by default. So by default this is how the GUI looks like: http://i.imgur.com/z5eftpD.png It says it blocked 102 font downloads. When I click on that icon it gets a red cross, meaning it is disabled. I interpret that as the blocking is disabled, meaning the functionality of the extension. But in either case I see - after reload of course - fonts datea1.woff, mail-ltr43.woff and uh.woff2 in the resources overview.
-------------------------
default
> Resources tab showed 3 remote fonts for Yahoo mail both times I went to Yahoo mail and I did not see any font resources not being blocked if the font-blocking switch is enabled. Please provide an example of URL of a font resource which is not blocked by uBlock on that site when the font-blocking switch is enabled. Blocking fonts is *not* turned on by default, the *only* way this per-site switch can be turned on is by the user clicking on it. Go into _My rules_ pane in the dashboard and see if there are rules for the "no-remote-fonts" switch. If so, remove them all to remove the blocking of fonts anywhere.

I tried a few pages and I do not see this behavior (using default settings/lists). When blocking resources from a site, this may cause side effects on web pages, and it's probably what you are experiencing. Whether there are side effects and what they are depends directly on how the site is designed, what is being blocked, and this itself depends on what filter lists and rules are in effect.

I'm using the default lists also, EasyList, Peter Lowe's Ad server list, EasyPrivacy, Malware Domain List and Malware domains. In Yahoo Mail I see this message on the left hand panel under the "Recent" email dropdown and on the main Yahoo signon page in the middle of the screen. I see this in the latest versions of Centbrowser and Chromodo which are using Chromium version 44. I tried a different adblock for testing (ADP) and don't see this message with that extension. Thanks.
-------------------------

I just tried with my Yahoo mail account and I did not see this message. I am using default filter lists. What filter lists are you using?
-------------------------
default
"Do not track" does not disable tracking, "Do not track" is about you asking those who have an interest in tracking you to not track you. I personally do not believe we should ask trackers to not track us. Best is to not connect to trackers' servers, and this is accomplished through using the proper filter lists. EasyPrivacy is the most useful and it is selected by default. There are more 3rd-party filter lists which can be selected, your choice. Ultimately, default-deny scripts/frame does wonder, but one has to be ready to "fix" web sites, to find and unblock only what is necessary for a web site to function properly.

Are you blocking "t.co"? It's what Twitter uses when you click a link. With default settings, uBlock does not block "t.co", so you would have to look at what you changed in the settings which causes this.

Try to add the following in the Whitelist pane in the dashboard: chrome-extension-scheme It's normally in there by default at first install, but maybe you removed it?
-------------------------

The change is actually to be sure users are not suffering the negative consequences of prefetching privacy-wise. That's the only change which occurred. That prefetching feature is enabled by default and hidden in advanced settings in Chrome, so users do not usually change it, which is an issue for someone using a privacy-minded extension like uBlock. In the next release it will possible to re-allow prefetching, but at least now users will allow it in an informed consent manner.

@Raymond Hill I completely forgot this setting (on my win7 machine I unchecked it ages ago and since then I came to consider it as off by default). Chromium now closes all processes properly while Chrome leaves some behind still.

Not sure what you mean by "PDF readers". Give me a specific example, like a URL and tell me what is blocked that you would like to be un-blocked by default -- I guess you mean everywhere?
-------------------------

When you say "all the pictures and text", do you mean on web pages, or for the extension UI itself? If it's the extension UI itself, then it appears your installation was damaged, i.e. something on your computer tampered with your browser installation. Re-install uBlock hopefully would work, and if so, you will need to find out what is trashing uBlock. If it's web pages, than you must have created a bad filter or rule. Things to try: - Un-check "I am an advanced user" if it is checked. - Click "Reset to default settings" in the dashboard.

uBlock Origin v0.9.7.0 / Chromium For help I read from here: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki/Logger "It is possible to click on the status indicator area to open the matrix for the associated tab (if any). The matrix will open in sticky mode" 1) Allow: * user to click in "the status indicator area" while uBlock 'pop-up' is opened to change the scope * Hot keys: Esc - close the 'sticky' uBlock 'pop-up' Space - Minimize/shrink the 'sticky' uBlock 'pop-up' More Hot keys: ` (backtick) - toggle show full/short URL 1 - toggle the 'funnel' (on/off the usage of filter) If possible - Maybe these Hot keys have to be user-selectable or at least give some hint which are they e.g. in some (?) icon 2) (maybe) After the filter type-box add drop-down to select (auto-type) most used filters e.g.: |-- (show only blocked) !|-- (show only NOT blocked) |bts (behind-the-scene) ... Recently used - the last 10-20 filters as typed by the user (by the way - "|bts" or "bts" do not work - it hides all (maybe not implemented in v0.9.7.0)) 3) Please return the drop-down (maybe at the right of [1000] box) to select a tab or behind-the-scene with default set to: "Show ALL events" (but user may prefer to set the default as was before: to the tab from where the Logger was opened) I usually monitor behind-the-scene after adding some new add-on to see "If an add-on constantly phone home" (I understand I give you too much to 'think about' but I hope you'll consider if any of the above worth your time to implement ;) )

Do you Really want this? Do you read pages in 20 languages? How many ads did you see with only the Default filters? "All filters" will make browser run slower and use more CPU and RAM I did't tested how much but there will be 'some effect' Do you know how many lines there are in EasyList alone? It is written "57,015 used out of 57,048" but take a look and see what have to be parsed/processed: https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt Default filters + 1-2 additional languages is enough for me.

I can't see any "huge ad frame" on Youtube when using default settings. Did you un-select any of the filter lists selected by default? Please file an issue on Github if you think there is something wrong with uBlock: <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues>, as it is difficult here to work on issues, and you can easily share screenshots so that I can see what you are talking about (I can't reproduce). Most of the time it is found that the problem is that default settings have been tampered with, or that a 3rd-party filter list is causing the issue.
-------------------------

Tjhis happens only if you disallow popups using the "no popups" switch. See:<https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Manually-editing-per-site-switches#caveats>. > Chromium-based browsers: If you block popups everywhere by default (no-popups: * true), this will break "Open link in new tab" in the context menu. This is because of Chrome API limitations

uBlock is more strict because more filter lists are selected by default. I looked into the issue for wistv.com, and indeed, an entry in the list "Peter Lowe's" was blocking a resource needed by the site for proper playback. To fix the issue, a new version of uBlock's own filters is available, and this should show in the "3rd-party filters" pane. If it doesn't show that there is a new version available, restart uBlock, then you should be able to see it, and update it. Another way is to un-select "Peter Lowe's", this will make uBlock less strict and closer to how ABP behaves.
-------------------------
default
I wish there was an option to have uBlock disabled by default but only active on sites that I choose when I notice especially intrusive ads. I basically want the extension turned on but the blocking turned off unless I choose to block on that particular site -- which I would then do by clicking the icon as I currently do to *disable* ads rather than having to go in and edit URLs by hand. It should be a streamlined experience.
-------------------------
default
It blocks Youtube video ads by default.
-------------------------
default
As said on the front page of the project, uBlock is not an "ad blocker", so not everything which is blocked is an "ad". EasyPrivacy is enabled by default in uBlock. Because of EasyPrivacy, uBlock by default will also block trackers/analytics. When you play a Youtube video, there are recurrent network requests which are blocked because of filters in EasyPrivacy. If you use EasyPrivacy in Adblock Plus, you will get the same exact result.

What are your settings? I don't have a Yahoo email account, but I doubt there would be a problem with the filter lists selected by default.
-------------------------
default
Yes. The statistics will reset only when the root document changes. Nowadays, Youtube (and some other sites) do not fully load a page, they instead incrementally update pages. This means the statistics will stay. uBlock ships with EasyPrivacy enabled by default, and Youtube makes often requests which are blocked by EasyPrivacy, hence the count keeps going up. Probably the same would happen with another blocker with EasyPrivacy enabled.

0.8.7.0 blocks everything by default. The previous version did not.

Unfortunately it's a browser behavior, and it doesn't look like there is anything workaround. Longtime ago I tried to internally cache the state of the icon in order to avoid repainting it if it didn't change, but I found out this was not possible to implement because the browser will redraw the icon without first asking the extension (using the default icon in the manifest).
-------------------------

Someone has changed your local gateway's default DNS to OpenDNS, it has nothing to do with µBlock or Chrome. Try the same page in another browser for proof.
-------------------------
default
Addenda: it appears that the blocked domain I tried to access is not included in any of the lists used by default by the extension, so it seems that Chrome really is using OpenDNS to resolve addresses. This is not right. If I want OpenDNS I will set it so.

I'm a big user of the StumbleUpon extension for Chrome, but I also want to block 3rd party scripts and iframes by default, however the way that the StumbleUpon extension works is by creating an iframe at the top of every page for their toolbar. I've whitelisted stumbleupon.com and a few other sites they use, but the toolbar is always blocked. How would I go about completely whitelisting the StumbleUpon iframe but blocking others? Thanks!

uBlock uses the same lists as ABP: EasyList, EasyPrivacy, etc. ABP comes with only EasyList enabled by default, so if you want the same thing with uBlock, just un-select EasyPrivacy, Fanboy Social, Peter Lowe's, etc.

uBlock uses EasyList, EasyPrivacy, Fanboy Social Block by default. If you think it blocks too much, just un-select whatever list you do not want.

Sorry, a typo in config file caused the lists to not be seen anymore. I missed this one at testing as the config file was loading from cache.

Worked great for ages, then suddenly Chrome wouldn't load pages and deactivating this extension was the only thing that fixed it.

Been using it for ages, never worked on facebook but it blocked everything else, now it isnt working on everything else a lot of things are slipping through and you are not fixing it...
-------------------------

Ublock origin works for the most part, and up until recently it was borderline flawless. However. over the last few years, it has failed to keep up with various tactics used to circumvent it. Bestbuy, Twitch, various news outlets (even with javascript disabled) just to name a few examples.

As time goes on, more sites find ways to detect Ublock users and disable essential/simple functions (login, watch a stream, etc), and the only option is to disable Ublock when it happens. Workarounds don't get introduced, and as more websites add these tactics it will render Ublock useless except for a niche userbase.
-------------------------
javascript
Generally you can get past a paywall by disabling JavaScript on the site. Open the page / article you want to see, click the Ublock Origin extension icon, click "Disable JavaScript on this site" icon ( bottom right, looks like </> ), then refresh the page.
-------------------------
age
I've used this extension for ages and love it. However, it has completely broken all wikis on Gamepedia.com by blocking all links within the site. That combined with the fact that the github page provides no way to contact the devs directly (creating issues is limited to devs apparently) means I'm forced to give this one star for now. Fix links on gamepedia (and preferably allow any user to create an issue or provide a way for us to contact you) and I'll happily increase the stars to 5.
-------------------------
age
Seems to be broken after working well for ages, no ads are blocked, settings are gone and can't change them.

I love being able to forget that YouTube has ads. And Spotify's web player.

Notable features: Element zapper (hold shift to keep using it), disable all blocking for the current site with one click (with complimentary reload button nearby), manual site blocking, premade lists for malicious and undesireable site blocking (sites such as ad redirects), easy options to disable said blocking temporarily (a few minutes) or permanently when encountering a blacklisted site.

I haven't used these, but it seems useful to have options to block "all popups," "large media elements" (i.e. autoplaying videos), and JavaScript (I'm afraid to know when you'd need that).
-------------------------
javascript
Ok i reinstalled just to see if I could read articles in peace.  Within a couple of minutes, I started getting spammed for my email. I tried manually blocking as suggested below but I am sorry, it doesn't work. They get around ublock by throwing up a dark element. You can block it for a few seconds, but it keeps coming back. The only way I could stop their popups , was to disable javascript.
-------------------------
javascript
Just found this extension, no more probs against inline javascript ads.
-------------------------
javascript
It started out to be a great ad blocker, but then it started blocking too many legitimate pieces of code. Especially on e-commerce websites where it might block certain javascript code blocks which cause pieces of the pages to act unexpectedly or not work at all due to missing javascript and swallowed script errors. I removed this and will just deal with ads instead.
-------------------------
age
Been using this application for ages and have had no problems however for the past week popup ads have started to show up not sure if this is due to the extension as when i remove the extensions no ads show up but when i have it ads are showing. I hope its something else not this extension as i really enjoyed this extension. Hopefully that havent started selling whitelists to people like adblock. :(
Just not gonna use it for the moment
-------------------------
javascript
Switched from Adblock after the developer recently cashed out to an unknown entity. I saw uBlock Origin featured on a TWiT podcast, and was sold.

I also scrapped my outdated Javascript blocker, as I feel the Dynamic Filtering in uBlock Origin is a better alternative. This also resolves any conflicts there might have been while using a Javascript blocker & Adblocker separately. 

The developer refuses donations, and works at his own pace. Previous projects include HTTP Switchboard, uMatrix, uBlock, and now uBlock Origin.
-------------------------
javascript
Works great blocking ads; unfortunately it also blocks a variety of non-advertising related javascript, leading to rendering issues on multiple websites.

Hi, love your product. Wanted to give a quick example of a false positive. On https://partners.xebialabs.com, whatever javascript is used on their form submission gets blocked by UD so you cannot actually login without disabling it.

At the moment, a whitelisted site takes priority over the blocking made via the menu. Shouldn't it be the other way around? (For example, to allow blocking javascript even in a whitelisted site?)

As of yesterday, uBlock has been playing up for me. Pages take ages to load properly because they spend ages waiting for uBlock to respond, and nothing happens when I click on the uBlock icon anymore. This is my preferred adblocking solution when it works, but it's not really usable in this state.

uBlock seems to be preventing me from progressing in the transaction of buying an online ticket - from the page asking for a loyalty card number, clicking "proceed" shows a line about javascript at the bottom of the page, and it shows that it loads, but never goes past that.

Certain website take action by embedding a pop-up command in javascript, or when you click on a link or a general mouse-click. Have you investigated this to disable this behavior?

If by "crash" you mean "Aww snap!", that's a browser crash, and this should be reported to Chromium devs: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list uBlock is written in javascript, and it's not supposed to crash. If it does, it's a browser bug.
-------------------------
consent
The change is actually to be sure users are not suffering the negative consequences of prefetching privacy-wise. That's the only change which occurred. That prefetching feature is enabled by default and hidden in advanced settings in Chrome, so users do not usually change it, which is an issue for someone using a privacy-minded extension like uBlock. In the next release it will possible to re-allow prefetching, but at least now users will allow it in an informed consent manner.
-------------------------
consent
I know of extensions which do no ask for that Privacy permissions and yet they send themselves your browsing history. What really matters is whether an extension makes good use of the permission it asks, and in the current case uBlock makes good use of the Privacy permission, to disable prefetching. I will allow re-enabling it in the next version, at least this will now be an informed consent choice by users.
-------------------------

@Raymond Hill I completely forgot this setting (on my win7 machine I unchecked it ages ago and since then I came to consider it as off by default). Chromium now closes all processes properly while Chrome leaves some behind still. I didn't mean to high-jack your thread for general browser maintenance, but thank you for taking the time to answer. that's very cool of you.
-------------------------
javascript
I have a workaround but it involves 4-5 clicks too often: - When on the site main pages - Disable/block JavaScript (by icon before 'www.') - When on the video page - Enable/Allow JavaScript (video pages on that site do not have the detection) I don't know which JavaScript function detects uBlock and is it possible to block/workaround this function somehow. You may also use other similar sites like: http://livetv.sx/ http://cricfree.tv/
-------------------------
javascript
> Wonder why these extensions need to interact with System that much... uBlock/uMatrix are written in javascript. They have nothing to do with the system, and that the Chrome tasks themselves are at zero proves this: uBlock/uMatrix do not bypass the browser, so whenever they do something it shows up in Chrome's own Task Manager.
-------------------------
javascript
It's a browser crash, this needs to be reported to Chromium developers. uBlock is written in javascript, javascript cannot cause crashes, browser bugs can cause crashes.
-------------------------
consent
I guess you are referring to the behavior of the big button. It has been asked before, and I declined: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/177 All web sites should *fully* inform you about their tracking/data mining, including that of 3rd-parties on their pages, and once fully informed, ask you whether you consent to this. The ads are just the visible tip of the tracking/data mining. Assuming web sites are behaved because there is no visible ads (or just so-call "acceptable ads") is foolish. Sorry but this would go counter to my principles, I can't and won't do it.
-------------------------
javascript
I just checked and what you describe is consistent with disabling 1st-party javascript. Dynamic filtering is for users who understand the consequences of blocking javascript, suitable for users who would install NoScript in Firefox.
-------------------------
javascript
I don't have these problems. Did you disable javascript?
-------------------------
javascript
Also re. crash: the browser crashes, javascript doesn't crash. If the page crashes with "Aww snap", this needs to be reported to Chromium dev. (I didn't see any crash here).
-------------------------
javascript
What do you call "page crashes"? Is it the "Aw snap!" page? I cannot investigate without more details: steps to reproduce, version browser/extension, other installed extensions, URL addresses where the problem occurs, etc. I haven't seen anybody reporting such behavior so far, so it would seem there is something specific on your side causing this. If it is the "Aw snap!" page, it's really the browser crashing, and unless there is a bug in the browser, javascript can't cause such crash, it's a scripted language.

The extension as of the present time, completely stopped working on Google Chrome across all tabs. This appears to be the result of an update gone wrong, with requests being blocked coming up with the number "?". Please fix this ASAP.

Update: This issue I was able to resolve by using Extensity to shut off all my extensions and turn them back on. This issue lasted for many hours even when the browser was closed until I did this.

Update 2: Been a couple years, this extension has worked wonders. The latest update adding a "block element in frame" is welcome and I hope it helps get those particularly hard-to-delete elements blocked. Very impressed with this extension, everything else is a very distant second place.

Update 3: Breaks the Brave browser to the point it cannot load any webpages. Tested and verified this specific extension when turned on and off multiple times was the only culprit, no other extension replicated the issue. That is completely asinine and needs to be fixed. Flat 1 star until resolved.

Have used uBlock Origin since it first came out. Had difficulties with Google Chrome and Google Email (this week) not rendering the images and texts of emails. After uninstalling all of the Chrome browser extensions, find uBlock Origin is likely responsible for same. Google Gmail has done something that is causing images and texts of every Gmail category to briefly flash on and then suddenly disappear when this extension is enabled. Hope they fix it soon.
-------------------------

That's probably something with your browser and its unrelated with this extension. Try going to settings and looking if your search engine has changed to Bing and if it has just change it back to google.

I used to love using Ublock Origin 
Now I'm afraid it's more of a pain to deal with.

I can't use Netflix, YouTube Movies, Hulu, Amazon Movies, literally any streaming site with this installed.  Because something about the sites DRM will send my whole screen to loud static screen and it's never ending until I uninstall Ublock Origin.  Once Ublock was remove from my browser I don't have to keep unplugging my HDMI from my screen because of this stupid static screen popping up.

Better than Adblock Plus. ABP is great especially combined with a browser with built in adblocking, but it only goes so far, there are still some ads that can get through them such as ones built into video player clients (no other adblocking method I've tried has been able to stop them besides uBlock Origin). uBlock also blocks other ads too, but I was mostly concerned with trying to get the ads baked into video players to go away.

It's ok but, recently, it started removing images from the google shopping tab when I'm researching something. I tested it by turning each extension on & off one at a time & then refreshing the page & the only one that did it was this one.

DYNAMITE! This extension supremely exceeds my expectations. All I expected it to do when I first added it to my web browser was to just block annoying pop-ups but it also blocks my YouTube ads. Not only that, there is also a neat feature called "Block element..."! This may be TMI, but I had an assignment on Google Classroom from a previous semester which I wasn't satisfied with my grade, though my teacher would not let me redo it. Sometimes I would accidentally click on old assignments, and it the grade on that assignment still haunted me every time I saw it, even though it was from the past. I used the "Block element" feature to hide my grade and comments from my teacher on that specific assignment from my view. Bam! I don't have to see any unwanted negativity from the past. This extension is a MUST-HAVE! 😁

It's been a faithful companion on any browser I use for years. Unfortunately, it seemed to stop blocking ads on recipe sites. I know, makes me sound like a boomer, but since I use my chromebook as my recipe book... it's kinda annoying. These recipe sites not only make you scroll through a mountain of crappy dialogue about the recipe before the actual instructions itself, but now I gotta see completely ridiculous ads? Boo!

Other than that, I'll never use any other adblocker. I can't trust a site that asks me to turn it off; between them and Ublock, I"ll chose ublock every time.

I love this: chrome/google hates this program.  This stops 99% of all ads.  If you notice chrome not allowing you to use this extension.  Try removing chrome and reinstalling if this doesn't fix it.

Only gripe with this app is that I have some things on my filter to block them, but whenever it blocks me, it sends me a notification in a new browser, which is basically just sending me an ad to tell me that it has blocked an ad. It totally defeats the purpose.

Stop using Google as much as you can. Use the fairly new Brave search and DuckDuckGo. Sometimes I do have to use Google because sometimes I can't find what I'm looking for on the other search services. Hopefully, they can catch up to Google sooner than I'd like them to, which is right now.

Also, if you're using Google Chrome, use the Brave browser or equivalent instead.

I have been using UBO for almost three years and have found that it catches 99% of all ads and other annoyances (depending on the filters used). When I build client computers, or simply do maintenance, I always install UBO to their browser of choice. And I am told by these clients that they never knew how ads were making their Internet experience horrible. UBO FTW!!

After uBlock Origin superseded Adblock Plus on my computers for almost a year now I almost forgot what ads were....until today 12/3/2019 when I noticed terribly slow browser performance when using Google Chrome. Not sure if there was an update/change.

I honestly thought it was an issue with my internet/router at first but after a few test I can confirm the issue lies with the extension. Symptoms I am experiencing are extremely slow page loads no matter the website. This especially happens when using incognito mode and will at time's cause the browser to become unresponsive when trying to change uBlock Origin's extension settings when it is enabled. Issue disappear's after disabling the uBlock Origin extension.

As with everything in life, I get hiccups can happen but uBlock Origin is definitely a cut above the rest. Hope this get's fixed soon so I can continue to enjoy no ad/pop up life once again! Thanks for what you do!

I love Ublock Origin.  My husband told me about it and I started using it. then, I tried a different browser other than Chrome or Firefox and decided to try other ad block and ad popup extensions.  I can honestly say that none of the others work.  I still got popups, ads opening in new tabs and new windows.  Yet, This ap, Ublock Origin does not do that at all.  I was a fool for thinking that there was a better popup blocker out there.

Leon, add whatever sites you want to function normally to the trusted sites section under options. Additionally what game do you play? It would have to be browser based for Ublock to affect it, so same goes, add it to the trusted sites. 
Garren, some sites work consistently to get around ad blockers. It is their primary revenue stream typically, so it's in their interest. It's a back and forth, Ublock will catch up, just had a YT ad for the first time in quite a while.

What an extension !!! . I have used a lot of ad-blockers but none of them work like U-block origin. They were using high amount of RAM in my system. Sites which consist of too many ads are usually slowed down with those ad-blockers. Also, it doesn't participate in acceptable-ads program. I'm using slimjet browser with in-built ad-blocker. But I disabled that ad-blocker and downloaded ublock origin because that ad-blocker was creating above problems. I love it.
-------------------------

i always feel the lightness of this extension add-on because i never get to see my browser indicate "not responding" or even take long while closing or reopening closed tabs. Plus the ads stopped menacing me around so often as i noticed the redirection is captured midway

You really can't go wrong with this. Low resource usage, effective ad-blocking, and a little bit of security on top of it all, blocking dangerous popups from running on your browser. They offer an easy-access method of allowing certain ads as well, to support sources that you believe deserve them. Overall, just easy to use, effective, and very minimal in it's footprint for being so effective. It beats out every competitor, in every way.

Since about a month ago this extension has been intermittently causing mouse clicks not to be properly registered. Double clicks are ok, but single clicks often not always registered - but sometimes ok on the same site. Disabling uBlock Origin fixes problem.
DO NOT USE at present with chrome on a mac - ok with other browsers and chrome on a PC.
I guess problem caused by either a recent MacOS or Chrome or uBlock update. Needs to be fixed.

After having this ad blocker on for a number of months, I've decided to delete it. I actually find that it blocks too much stuff. As a result, web pages often don't display properly. This means I have to turn it off for the site, making all the ads populate the page. It also has a tendency to block me from accessing pages when I click on ads from my email, the only ads I actually want to interact with. Sure, I can continue on to the page by overriding it, but sometimes that takes a number of clicks. I feel like this blocker gets in the way more than it helps, compared to other options. I will say that the one time I watched Hulu in my browser, I liked that it blocked their ads. But I very rarely use a computer for that service, so it just doesn't fit my needs.
-------------------------

Ah, uBlock Origin. That little icon sits in the top corner, never getting looked at.

Clicking Apply Changes, Import, etc. in Dashboard (Settings) as well as Element Picker, etc. for drop-down panel all fail to do anthing with latest Vivaldi Chromium browser (1.11.917.43 (Stable channel) (64-bit) with latest uBlock Origin (1.14.8) for Windows 10 x64.

This is an incredible extension, which I have always found indispensable and would otherwise be 5 star. 
Please fix so works with other Chromium-based browsers besides Google Chrome.

I used adblock plus for a while before it started making my browser lag and  doing that acceptable ads thing, so I looked for a replacement and found Ublock Origin. Best decision I made because it blocks everything and doesn't over bloat my browser.
-------------------------
browser
This is a must for any Chrome/Chromium type browser user.
-------------------------
browser
I have the worst time about pop-ups and ads that take over the browser, this app only blocks youtube ads and sidebar ads for me. Only plus is that is runs smoothly and doesnt make chrome lag like hell, but I'm still not happy when it lets the most annoying of ads through.
-------------------------
browser
Has been very effective until recently, when I've started getting ads loading behind my Chrome browser. Have deleted and reloaded to see if that will do the job (and added a supplementary, UBlock Origin Extra from the same developer).
-------------------------
browser
Was okay for a while now I keep getting advertisement pop ups. Thought it was virus, but only got it in Chrome (when Firefox was default browser). I reinstalled windows 10 on my laptop but still got them (since on fresh install I put ublock again). 

I tried installing my chrome plugins one at a time per week, and after installing uBlock again, I got the pop ups. 

Definitely annoying - most of the time they were porn and I was scared to use my laptop in front of my Girlfriend!!!

Definitely do not recommend
-------------------------
browser
I'm assuming you're unaware of how to disable uBlock Origin?  You click the power icon in the extension's menu at the top right of your browser.

The good
• I love it. It is owned and supported by a friendly community. Not a corporation. More secure because its code is publicly available for review and contributions on GitHub at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
• Easy to use. With both basic or advanced modes.
• Lightweight on memory and CPU resources
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome
• Clear Manifesto:
......• The user decides what web content is acceptable or not in their browser.
......• The uBlock project does not support Adblock Plus' "Acceptable Ads Manifesto", because the "Acceptable Ads" marketing campaign is really the business plan of a for-profit entity.
......• Users are best placed to know what is or is not acceptable to them. uBlock's sole purpose is to give users the means to enforce their own choices.
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome.
• Lots of features
• uBlock Origin has a better track record at fully protecting your privacy, than AdBlock Plus (ABP). There is a controversy around ABP and its related for profit corporation trying to monetize ABP via ad whitelisting. Which means that corporation sales your privacy for profit :( Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adblock_Plus#Controversy_over_ad_filtering_and_ad_whitelisting

The bad
• Confusion with the names. Between "uBlock Origin" and "uBlock". For those not familiar with those names, uBlock Origin is better than uBlock. Mostly because as of May 2017 Ublock Origin is still actively maintained and updated. Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin#uBlock_.28ublock.org.29uBlock Compare to uBlock which as not been maintained and updated for more than 2 years, since 2015, and is trying to monetize an open source project.

Had the exact same situation. Thought it was just an issue with my browser or ublock configuration. Glad (relatively) to see that I'm not the only one with the issue.
-------------------------
browser
I am having the same issue.  I have disabled for now.  Prior to disabling Chrome was constantly becoming non-responsive, and a look in task manager showed 7+ iterations of Chrome running, all but one of which could be closed immediately.  The last one could not be ended and I had to wait it out about 5 minutes, or restart my computer, in order to be able to open Chrome again.  This was all while browsing in a single tab.  I love the features just need to be able to use the browser to take advantage of them.

You can toggle it off for a site without disabling the whole extension. You click on the uBO icon showing in your browser, then click the large blue power button symbol (when your mouse hovers over it, it says "click: disable/enable uBO for this site).

UBlock Origin is currently the best overall set-it-and-forget-it ad blocker/general-purpose blocker browser extension with the lowest RAM and CPU usage in my opinion, and it is the only one that I have used so far that can block most annoying pop-up ads.

Keep up the good work,

Finally i've found popup blocker works with popup when click a page that opens a new browser window.When opening a new browser window this extension interfere and immediately shuts down the new browser window.Nice work.
-------------------------

This app worked great then all of sudden it stopped working consistently . The only way to keep it working is to uninstall and reinstall every time delete my browser history Chrome.
Update 10/7/16 Now I must uninstall and reinstall daily or it to work consistently. WORTHLESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Adblock Plus was noticeably decreasing browser performance. Ublock Origin noticeably increased performance. At this point I strongly recommend not using Adblock Plus
-------------------------
browser
I LOVED uBlock and it all of a sudden stopped working.  My browser is up to date. If i press the uBlock Origin logo on my chrome menu bar nothing happens.  It used to open a menu that showed me options about what ads were being blocked etc but now it's not working at all. I'm upset because I was much happier with this extension than my previsou adblocker but it is giving me zero functionality now.
-------------------------
browser
Try disabling/enabling uBO from the Extensions page. It may happens sometimes after a browser or extension update that an extension is left in a bad state -- I've seen this happen, though rarely. Disabling then re-enabling uBO fixed the issue once when I stumbled onto it.
-------------------------
browser
Slim down all the crap your browser is told to download by the sites you're visiting. Great for users more comfortable tweaking settings as well as those who just want a cleaner surfing experience. 

For those in the latter category: be prepared for more interaction with your browser as you may find videos, images, comment sections, etc., not loading like you're accustomed to. 

Once you learn the ad block way, you can never go back. 

Want to support sites by allowing ads? Whitelist them.
-------------------------
browser
Adblock Plus started causing massive slow page loading and overall browser slowness. Switched to uBlock Origin all those problems resolved.

I blamed windows 10 because I thought their latest anniversary update made my browsers lag, so I tried to fix my windows 10 but still nothing, so I tried disabled all my extensions except this one because I trusted this extension, but then I almost give up and tried to disable only this extension and everything back to normal, WTH ublock? you slow down my chrome like hell, I trusted you like you're made by google itself

I've begun using Vivaldi Browser which i based om chromium and it does not work so well while using none incognito together with incognito at the same time.
-------------------------

Doesn't block ads, still keep showing up on my browser. Pathetic.
-------------------------
browser
It's a browser bug, see:
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=595345
-------------------------
browser
Those ads originate not from your browser but from adware and malware in your own system. They are a type of computer virus and cause pop-ups like these. I would recommend you to acquire an antimalware for your system.
-------------------------
browser
This addin give you more than just an add blocker - advanced users can control / block many aspects of the browser interaction.
-------------------------
browser
Trust me I have tried them all on every different platform and browser. uBlock Origin not only does a better job at blocking ads than all others, but also uses far less system resources than the likes of adblock plus etc.. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
-------------------------
browser
I was struggling to block some ad. Now after installing the browser is ad free
-------------------------
browser
Maybe it's because of Chrome Sync? Extensions can't install/uninstall themselves, the browser does this, so it's unfair to blame uBlock Origin for this problem.
-------------------------
browser
I heard that uBlock Origin was less resource hungry than other adblock plug-ins, so I gave it a try. Wow, it completely blew me away. It effectively blocked out all kinds of ads. Even Pandora ads are blocked. The other plug-ins don't do that. I love it so much that I installed it on all my browsers.
-------------------------
browser
Chromium Extensions are stored on the disk in unpacked form (i.e. the file Downloaded is .crx based on .zip - it is unpacked and the .crx deleted)
The exact place depends on OS, browser, User-name

To find uBlock Origin:
- Go to \Users\ or \Documents and Settings\  directory
- Search in all subfolders for directory name:
cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm

You can confirm you found uBlock Origin's directory by opening the file in it: manifest.json
Inside manifest.json there will be line:
      "default_title": "uBlock Origin"

Examples of possible paths to Extensions:
\Users\{User-name}\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\
\Documents and Settings\{User-name}\Local Settings\Application Data\Chromium\User Data\Default\Extensions\

If you use Portable browser Extensions will be in browser's own directory (near the .exe):
...\Slimjet\User Data\Default\Extensions\
...\IronPortable\Profile\Default\Extensions\
-------------------------
browser
Fast, and doesn't track your browser data like Adblock now does.

I had trusted my browser security to Ghostery for years, but with the latest version they secretly added ads and spying, and that trust was broken.  I decided to try this instead.  Glad I did.  It works just as well and without all the sneaky stuff.

One of few addons that brings a real meaning to "µ" (micro)
 
But there is one feature I miss, and are a dealbreaker for me:
Being able totemporarily disable it alltogether.
I can temporarily disable µblock for the current site, but as soon as I click on an ad that IS interesting, trying to open a new window, it's blocked despite that µblock is temporarily disabled.

I have to turn the addon off completely, and restart the browser in order to click on that interesting ad.

Not as lightweight as claimed. Absolutely jams on certain sites, the block counter spiralling and the browser window virtually locked up. Needlessly blocks icons.

When I go to the Chrome Web Store and try to add it to the browser it fails as it's detected as a virus. "cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm_2141.crx tried to load a malicious resource detected as Amsi.Edge.21.7AF846AE and was blocked. Your device is safe." Originally I had Ublock Origin on my browser before I got Bitdefender and have been using it for awhile now. I ran into an issue so I uninstalled Ublock Origin. When I tried to add it back what I mentioned above happened. When I uninstall Ublock Origin from Firefox and reinstall it there's no issues present, it's just on Chrome. Firefox is only backup as Chrome is my main browser.

Yesterday my chrome suddenly became so slow it was unusable. All other browsers were fine but Chrome could not load any web pages fully. I narrowed the cause down to ublock being turned on. Only after turning it off did my chrome work normally again. It its current state the extension is unusable
-------------------------

Normally it does not slow down chrome at all... Try This... Start with Clearing the Chrome Browsers History and Cache To do it on the chrome browser (PC) select the ellipsis (3 dots on top of each other) Go to 'MORE TOOLS' then Select 'Clear Browsing Data' A window will pop up and you will have 2 tabs that read Basic and Advanced... Start under the Basic Tab and Select the drop down menu to ALL Time and and make sure everything under that tab is selected with a check mark. Now Select the ADVANCED Tab Do the same thing and select All Time and Check Everything BUT 'Passwords and Signed in Data' (want to make sure you do not delete and passwords! so make sure that box is NOT Checked) Now Select the Button that reads Clear Data ------- Next select the ellipsis (3 dots) and Go under HELP and ABOUT Google Chrome... If your browser is not up to date it will now update. If the issue persists Uninstall Ublock Origins, Repeat the above Steps ... Reboot the PC and reinstall the browser extension...

I cannot connect to a remote system with chrome remote desktop on my local network if uBlock origin extension is enabled. Using the uBlock Origin "disable on site" button does not fix the problem. After some searching, I found that this may be caused by blocking WebRTC. When I check Brave browser settings, changing WebRTC IP handling policy is grayed out and hovering over an extension icon (that only exists when uBlock origin is enabled) reveals the text "this setting is enforced by the 'uBlock origin' extension". However, the "Prevent WebRTC from leaking local IP addresses" is missing in the uBlock Origin settings tab. I read comments on Github that this option is disabled in uBlock Origin by default, but that does not seem to be the case. Please help.

This is a very minor issue, but uBlock Origin is blocking the following pop-up prompt on YouTube: "The following content has been identified by the YouTube community as inappropriate or offensive to some audiences." *user must click the prompt: "I understand and wish to proceed." * It seems like the uBlock Origin extension thinks this scenario is a pop-up ad, when it is actually a YouTube user interface prompt. To get around this, I have to disable the extension. An example of this issue can be observed by trying to watch the following video on YouTube with uBlock Origin active: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moK9JVvbbZ0 However, this video is not the only case. This occurs with any YouTube video that automatically generates the explicit content prompt. Other than that, thank you so much for such an amazing browser extension!

The only way I've found to watch videos, including and especially the live news broadcast on the WHIO ( https://www.whio.com/whio-tv/ ) website is to Allow w3.cdn.anvato.net within the uBO browser extension.

Please make this allowable by default rules or filters in the next release. * Please note that many of us in the WHIO broadcast cannot receive a stable over-the-air television signal, and as such rely on the website to retrieve our news updates. If there is something I'm missing, please let me know at your earliest convenience. Thank you all so much for your hard work and dedication to this project! _

Basically each time you close a website down.. Chrome saves the website in order to preload it next time you open the web browser... but guess what... Chrome completely ignores your adblock's work and preloads the ads that you have previously blocked as well... good job Chrome(not really) lol

uBlock origin sometimes causes the tab I'm using to disappear when I click a link to navigate. Not crash, disappear. This has been going on for quite a while, but I recently discovered a 100% reliable way to reproduce the issue so I can report it. What's weird about this set of circumstances is it's really not obvious how the site could be "at fault", since the tab that closes is unrelated to the tab that was running uBlock Origin. Repro steps: 1. Navigate to https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/news/how-birds-of-prey-is-building-gothams-future/ar-AAI7OVn 2. Select the text "Birds of Prey(and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)." 3. Right click -> Search Google for "Birds of Prey..." 4. In the new tab, click on the first youtube link. RESULT: the tab closes without warning, bringing you back to msn.com. This issue does not reproduce if uBlock origin is disabled on msn, but it does still reproduce if it was enabled on msn but disabled on google. That's super weird, because msn wasn't responsible for launching google.com, the browser was, so msn couldn't be responsible for closing it. My best guess, therefore, is this is a bug in uBlock Origin itself.

The trend I am seeing now is that many sites are fighting anti-stalkers and privacy tools. I don' allow Google Fonts because it tells Google where I am, what site I'm on, what time, from where and for how long. With most web sites, built on generic templates that already include Googleware, Fonts are a easy means for Google to record which sites we were on, and where we went. Now, many icons don't show up unless I drop my right to privacy. DuckDuck and startpage - so called purveyors of private browsing, use remote Fonts leaked my IP when I used BOTH privacy essentials. Some pages showed up as the old 1995 HTML style layouts, destroying and friendly navigation. Not much help I know, but maybe if you did a process of illumination, that is, use both, try several of the WWW sites, if you can get to a foreign site by circumventing the GDPR pervert and then close browser, unload uBlock and just use DDG's essentials. See how it goes. IMHO, it would be like having 2 cops for security at the door to house. They both seem suspicious so they use your resources to frisk each other, slowing down in/out. We have locks on our doors, and drapes, curtains and blinds on our windows but when we step into the Internet, we run naked - why?

This just started recently but while watch any videos on espn.com, about 3/4 of the way through the video it stops and the video window says "any error occured during video playback, possibly due to network connectivity or being in a background browser tab. Please try again". It is easily repeatable and appears to only happen on espn site. Yahoo and such seem to play fine. If I disable uBlock, the videos play fine on espn but I have to suffer through ads. I have been using uBlock for years with no issues. I am running uBlock Origin version 1.20 with Chrome Version 75.0.3770.100 (Official Build) (64-bit). The same problem exists when I use Microsoft Edge browser with espn.com. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. I am trying to find how to install and older version of uBlock since this issue just showed up recently.

Not a virus, you need to know the definition of a computer virus before making such allegations. And if it won't uninstall, it is a problem with your computer/browser. There is absolutely nothing the extension can do to stop you from uninstalling it from chrome. Also yes, it cannot die, since chrome automatically attempts to reboot all extensions if they either crash/killed by the computer (chrome's fault, nothing you can do). A feature of the extension is that it isn't going to close, it will continue to protect your browser against whatever the developer thinks necessary. If you believe this extension is causing issues with certain websites, while on the web page, you can press the icon for the extension, and by pressing the blue power button and refreshing the page, it will no longer attempt to block anything on this website. Also yes, viruses are removable, but highly powerful malware may not be, but don't fear, since uBlock automatically brings up warning when entering sites known to distribute malware.

JW Player Version 7.11.12 . Player works in incognito mode or when the uBlock Origin is disabled from that site, it's not on my user based filters as it is on the auto filters generated and expired every 4 days. If you could isolate the issue and fix it thank you for your browser plugin its been very handy these past years. https://www.watchcartoononline.io/playlist-cat/396/yu-gi-oh-gx-episode-119-english-dubbed

Someone wrote this to me but Im not sure what it means because im not a developer. This is to you the programmer to hopefully make Ublock better, enjoy. uBlock Origin's current fix for Twitch ads isn't going to last very long. They're setting a different platform variable in the request your browser makes for the HLS playlist, pretending to be a platform that doesn't have SureStream enabled. The only way to fix it is going to be to edit incoming HLS playlists to remove ad segments.

For the last few days, the extention has become unusable to me, if I use it, it progressively slows down the browser to the point that, one click or even one scroll with the mouse takes 10 seconds to respond. I use win 10 and the latest vivaldi version, I tried with the previous version as well.

Yesterday I saw that my backup of the settings was very old so I tried to make a new one through the settings tab of Ublock Origin. But I keep getting the message that the download failed due to a "Network Failure"? Obviously my net work is working since I am making this post. I use Ublock Origin in the latest Flashpeak Slimjet if that helps. I even tried it in the latest Vivaldi browser and the result is the same ... no backup is downloaded for the Ublock Origin settings?
-------------------------

A nice tool but would can you please in settings make an option not to darken the page when I select an element and at anytime. My eyes are sensitive when it goes from light to dark all the time. It slows everything down on the browser and also it looses focus on the popup I am currently trying to rid off that appears over hover. Thanks

I know that changing this flag is experimental, but I changed it to restore the old Chrome UI (before v69) and I could imagine that I'm not the only one doing that. Now, clicking the uBlock Origin icon in the address bar reliably crashes the entire browser (other actions related to ublock don't crash anything). Maybe this is easy to fix and worth a look?

Ive ran into an issue regarding my browser being hijacked. I cant remember the website, but it was a drive by download, it remained hidden in my browser and was allowed by inserting itself in the whitelisting of ublock. I was curious as to how that could occur, as I definitely didnt download anything, and I thought the adblocker should block browser redirects etc.
-------------------------

This was the comment I intended to make. I went for deleting and re-installing. I also noticed that the version on my Edge browser was 1.15 so it looks like the same there.

Yeah, I assumed that it was a Kinja issue as it spans all of the other browsers I've tried (Firefox, Internet Explorer). Quite frustrating if I may say so. I wonder if there is at all a practical solution to this.

U Block will work for an open session, when the browser is closed and re-opened it no longer works. You must uninstall and reinstall it and only then it will work that session. Works as normal in Google Chrome

After reinstalling the system and Google Chrome browser, it appears that new tabs are loading extremely slow with UBlock Extension on, and that's quite annoying. What can that be? The hardware acceleration and other possible interruptors in Chrome settings are currently off. And everything works fine except UBlock. I want to use your extension on daily basis, and I used it without any trouble before. But now there's some kind of malfunctioning. Could that be my system, browser, both or somewhat else? I'm currently using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with latest version of Chrome (Not Chromium, but standard GC itself).

This extension does not support yandex android browser!
-------------------------
browser
This is intentional (limitations of Yandex Android Browser API). Yandex Android Browser does not allow network filtering directly (does not have API for that), but instead allows extensions to register filters with it and then it will enforce these filters on its own. Therefore it requires special version of ad blocker (more accurately, merely a filter list manager), such as "Adguard Content Blocker" (not regular AdGuard) or "Adblock Fast" or something like that. More details: https://yandex.com/support/browser-mobile-android-tablet/useful-features/api-for-ad-blockers.html#switch-on-off DISCLAIMER: I did not ever use neither of "Adguard Content Blocker" nor "Adblock Fast" and thus can not recommend either of them.

Hi... I have problem of my email sites keeps log me out after browser restart. it wasn't like this before. I have locate problem that ublock is the culprit, after disabling ublock all work normally...
-------------------------
browser
Ublock is no longer working for message boards hosted on Boards2go.com. Normally (without any adblocking software) B2g will show a medium-sized banner at the top of each page. However, I and several other users believe that B2g and/or their ad supplier have enabled a malicious script to bypass adblocking software. Whenever you have your adblocker turned on (and we've tried it with multiple ones), the normal ad banners are replaced by larger, very intrusive banners that are sometimes borderline pornographic - sometimes multiple on the same page so that they take up the whole screen. This issue started some time ago and for a while Ublock was the only adblocker capable of hiding them and keeping them hidden. However, it seems the malicious ads have upped their game and Ublock is no longer able to keep them gone. I've tried different settings and filters and nothing works! Please, PLEASE fix this - these ads make the site nearly unusable. My site has used B2g for 9 years and if this continues we will have to consider the time-consuming hassle of switching to another host. (Other info: I use Chrome version 63.0.3239.132 but this issue seems to happen regardless of browser)
-------------------------

TL;DR: If you hate any kind of telemetry or are a pro-user and know what words "[software] community" mean, you want uBlock Origin. Also, uBlock Origin might occasionally break, especially if you use an unusual Chromium variant. If you want a slightly worse but a very consistent experience in any browser and are willing to compromise some of your privacy in exchange, Adblock Plus might be better for you. In the later case, I'd recommend looking into AdGuard -- a commercial company offering technical support help desk, but with a different financial model: getting money from users, not advertisers. (You may choose to pay for the product, and are guaranteed that you won't become the product.) Their browser extension is free, while the revenue comes from selling "advanced" licenses to users for standalone computers and mobile programs implementing features impossible for an extension. So they do need to sell your privacy to advertisers, and instead rely on money paid by some users. For example, I personally bought lifetime license for Android to have DNSCrypt (encrypted DNS) and I'm really happy with it. Also, both block pretty much the same ads, since all adblockers just follow instructions specified by the filter lists you choose and all lists are maintained by volunteers external to either project, except for Acceptable Ads (maintained by Eyeo GmbH). There are some differences due to uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus having slightly different syntaxes, but most rules are compatible with either one. Adblock Plus is a commercial product from a very financially successful company (its developer Eyeo GmbH pulls in revenue in hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Acceptable Ads, while employing about 100 people). On the other hand, uBlock Origin is completely non-commercial hobby project by a very talented individual (Raymond Hill) in his free time, who believes any financial activity might eventually compromise the primary objective (protect user choice and privacy), and thus does not even have a dedicated website or forum to avoid any financial activity. Adblock Plus offers consistency and limitations of a mass-market commercial product (and takes a bit of your privacy in return, even if you disable Acceptable Ads). uBlock Origin offers complete privacy and is more efficient (from my personal experience and according to all articles online I could find), but if you have a question, you'll go to the user community (a topic on Reddit) and you might be expected to read documentation. Here is some stuff I'd really recommend reading: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Why-don't-you-accept-donations%3F Privacy Policies: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Privacy-policy https://adblockplus.org/en/privacy

1. After Chrome launched, i can open one-two web pages in tabs, and while pages start to load, Chrome hangs for a 10-30 seconds with message in status bar "Waiting for extension uBlock Origin". During this time i can't open tabs, settings, can't close Chrome, it just hangs. After that 10-30 seconds everything becomes normal and open tabs resume their load. 2. When uBlock is disabled and Chrome restarted - i have no hangs at all, so it's definitely uBlock Origin. Tech details: latest Chrome, Win 7, run in the background after browser closed is disabled. I love uBlock Origin but can't handle this hangs every time i open my browser after reboot or after wi-fi reconnection. It would be nice if you can figure out what's happening, i read about the same issue from many different people on web but looks like still no fix.

I don't think this is what was intended, so I'm reporting it as a problem. I just noticed yesterday when I had a Google Doc open that the blocked ad count was steadily climbing the longer I worked in that tab. I finally opened the logger, and it appears that each time the document auto-saves, uBlock is counting it as a blocked ad. That's fine, except that once it gets over 500 or so it starts to slow the browser down a bit. Not a lot, just a little, but again, I don't think that's supposed to be happening. It happens in Google Sheets, too. If I refresh the tab it resets the counter, but that's annoying to have to do.

Probably you had just installed that other extension and Chrome did not indicate to uBO that it needs to redirect the request elsewhere. Just restarting the Chrome browser (closing all windows and opening it again) should fix it. (You probably already did that since you reported this 16 hours ago.)

Windows XP Chromium 40 and 35 uBlock Origin v1.7.6 Since the update links (homeURL in filter-lists.json) for EasyList and EasyPrivacy was changed to github.io - these two lists can't update Manually pasting in new tab: https://easylist.github.io/easylist/easylist.txt redirects to: https://easylist.to/easylist/easylist.txt which gives: ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH (I don't know if the cause is the OS or the browsers) To "fix" I use as "Custom" the old links which work OK: https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easyprivacy.txt P.S. This happens not for the first time. Two of the other lists (pgl.yoyo.org & malwaredomainlist.com) were having a problem with "Error type: Malformed certificate" and for 3-4 months (Feb-May (?)) they were unable to update (I "fixed" by using http: and not https:) I imagine such (intermittent?) problems can be avoided for everybody if you implement some more (backup) homeURL in filter-lists.json (homeURL2, homeURL3, ...) to be used automatically if the first URL failed.

Though quite rarely, I have seen this occurring a few times, with any extensions -- not specifically related to uBO. I found that it is as if Chrome is in a bad state internally. What worked on my side was to quit the browser, then launch again. Also, be sure that no instance of browser processes are still running in the background, there is an advanced browser settings which can be disabled to ensure this, disable "Continue running background apps when Chromium is closed".

So the remedy needs to be on a per-case basis, i.e. each instance needs to be reported to filter list maintainers, and specific cosmetic filters need to be crafted to foil these inline popups.

Nothing changed, this issue has been present for a while: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1185 The _Save_ operation causes the browser to fetch the page again from the remote server, and for some reasons, as soon as a network request is blocked, the Save operation is aborted by the browser. I consider this a browser bug, you may want to file an issue with Chrome developers. Saving a page works fine with Chromium, but not with Chrome, so Chrome is doing something different.
-------------------------
browser
Are there any error message? Also, some antiviruses are known to disable uBlock Origin, see: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Software-known-to-have-uninstalled-uBlock-Origin uBlock Origin does not contain code to disable itself, this can only be done by the user or the browser. You should report the issue to Chrome support.
-------------------------

It's just a warning, there is no harm. See: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1170#issuecomment-168989068 Just a warning, the browser makes it seem more serious than it is.

I've been using uBlock Origin for quite a while whithout problems. But since yesterday, when active, I cannot download files (when I click the link, nowthing happens, when i try to close the browser, it says download is in progress). When I click the upload file button on Facebook or Twitter, nothing happens. When I deactivate uBlock Origin, those things work again.

This is beyond the scope of uBO -- uBO is just an extension, it does not have access to your system, it can't "break" your browser installations or even its own installation -- something external to uBO is doing this. Seek support from Google Chrome people.
-------------------------
browser
The browser is responsible for updating the extension -- so if something does not work, you need to reach Google Chrome support. However be sure that you did not modify settings in uBO in such a way that you end up blocking behind-the-scene network requests, unless you know what you are doing, this could interfere with your browser's proper functioning. Behind-the-scene network requests: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Behind-the-scene-network-requests#how-to-filter-behind-the-scene-network-requests

Browser issue. Googled "application is already being downloaded and added to chrome" and you will find similar issues along with solution: http://superuser.com/questions/836029/installed-extension-doesnt-show-up If this does not work for you, you will have to report to your browser's support team.
-------------------------
browser
I remember someone reporting a similar issue elsewhere. For the next update, there will be a link for you to click to reach the dashboard. uBO is supposed to open the dashboard automatically when you click "Options", but there might be some Chromium-based browsers out there which implement the "Options" button differently.
-------------------------
browser
What is your browser? You can still access the options by clicking on the title bar of the popup panel.

Filters are out of date most of the time. They have the yellow "out of date" next to the filters. I wonder why they bother reporting it instead of just updating it themselves. I read somewhere that filters supposedly autoupdates every 4 days, however I don't know if it is working properly. How does it even keep track? What if you don't use the computer/browser everyday? At my friend house, it seems that ublock filters have been "out of date," most of the time. It seems Ublock doesn't know how "out of date" the filters actually are b/c the Chrome profile i set up is rarely used, sometimes weeks go in between usage if I am staying over at her house and using her computer. I know my filters may be weeks old, but ublock rarely autoupdates them. Does ublock updates every 4 days of browser usage, not whether the filters are more than 4 days old? I guess it isn't a big problem yet, as long as the addon block what it is supposed to and the addon is still awesome, but filter autoupdate mechanism may not be working correctly.
-------------------------
browser
When I do a manual updates it works, so I don't think anything is blocking network requests. At home, it isn't a problem b/c I use Chrome almost every day and the mechanism works like advertised for my main Chrome profile. However, my rarely used guest profile for anybody other than me has the same out of date issue. The filters could be weeks out of date, but Ublock won't autoupdate them until I it seems I use the profile for at at least 4 consecutive days? So I guess ublock auto updates filters after 4 days of browser usages not whether or the filters are more than 4 days old?
-------------------------
browser
uBO does not open a new tab, the browser does. uBO blocks the fetching of the document though for that new tab if there is a matching filter. You then chose to proceed or not. The ability to block the whole document is a feature specific to uBO. Other blockers will load the page even if there is a filter for it. This uBO feature is called "strict blocking": https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface#no-strict-blocking It is especially useful when a site tries to open nuisance or even malware site -- uBO will prevent the connection to even be made. Then you can choose to proceed ahead if you know the site ahead is actually safe, or close the tab.
-------------------------
browser
Having the same issue... I'm not sure if this is a browser issue. If it was, how can it be fixed? Using Chrome.
-------------------------
browser
Looks more like a browser issue to me. The popup is controlled by Chrome (or whatever Chromium-based browser you are using), it is opened and filled in by Chrome,and if it does not render at all, it's more than likely a browser bug.
-------------------------

I answered below: Strange, it appears this is a browser bug, as uBO does close the connection after testing whether the browser supports `RTCPeerConnection`. To test whether `RTCPeerConnection` is supported was introduced in 1.5.0 as a workaround for the browser crashing if it was not compiled with the webRTC support: Issue #533: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/533 Commit of the fix: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/commit/09d7d1fdc4a2bd8619ad51c56430f7f9c0cdb2cc

I'm using UC Browser, and I can't launch the option menu. It seems that uBlock Origin doesn't support most chromium-based browser other than Chrome. Can you fix this, please? Thank you.
-------------------------
browser
I use uBlock Origin in SRWare Iron (Chromium 27 & 35) and Slimjet Browser (Chromium 40)
-------------------------
browser
uBlock Origin is supported on Chromium, Chrome, Opera. I've heard it works on Vivaldi. So you are wrong with your assertion that it does not work on most chromium-based browsers. A user here confirmed no so long ago it worked on UC Browser. You can also click the title bar in extension popup to reach uBO's dashboard.
-------------------------
browser
I don't know why your uBO is disabling itself, your browser or something else on your browser is doing this. There are software known to remove uBO, see if this is your case: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Software-known-to-have-uninstalled-uBlock-Origin Other than this, you should probably try to clean up your computer: http://decentsecurity.com/holiday-tasks/

Chromium 35 & 40 (IronPortable & Slimjet Browser), Windows XP uBlock Origin v1.3.3 I don't know if this breaks functionality of uBO or is only visual glitch: When some list is "orange" (= need Update) and I click [Update now] - if the site/URL where the list is fetched from do not respond (site is down at the moment): -- the list remains "orange" (which is OK, but maybe some notice "why" will be good, e.g. "timeout - can't fetch list") -- if I click the list name the list is/shows empty, i.e. blank page with address: chrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/asset-viewer.html?url=assets/thirdparties/www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/hosts.txt chrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/asset-viewer.html?url=http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts I *think* (but am not sure) that the total number of filters: 71,833 network filters   53,982 cosmetic filters from: ... decreases in such case. When finally the list is downloaded OK (= no more "orange") - the same "click the list name" shows the local copy with "current" date line in the list, e.g.: # Last updated: Dec 8th, 2015 at 10:37 (I tried to find in assets.js the order/logic of list update but it was too big challenge for me to follow ;) I wanted to know if the order is similar to this: Download new copy of list to temp file Only if the new copy is OK (how to check that?) - replace the old local list by the new (maybe even keep the old as backup/restore point? Option?) ) ________ To reproduce: Probably the "site is down" can be simulated by redirecting the site to localhost - on Windows by 'hosts' file (I don't know how to do that on Linux) 127.0.0.1 www.malwaredomainlist.com 127.0.0.1 someonewhocares.org But I don't know how to make the list "orange" without [purge cache]

@gorhill - If you check any support ticket inside the developer dashboard the reporter's User Agent string (with browser & OS versions) + the extension's version are both recorded. e.g. for uBlock: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/support/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm

I don't have any "wonderful work" on uBlock Origin, I'm just a user. Raymond Hill is the author. I don't know all the details about lists, but: - it is obvious that if some checked list show "0 used of XXXX" you can un-check it (because all lines in it are already present in some other list) - I don't think you will see any slowdown if you keep redundant lists checked - I think uBlock Origin will use the same amount of RAM and CPU during browsing. The only little slowdown may be at browser start - and you can try to measure it several times with many lists checked and then with only Fanboy+Easylist-Merged checked.
-------------------------
browser
What do you mean by "crashing"? You need to give me more details about what is the issue, and also about your environment: browser version, OS, filter lists selected, when does it "crash"? Is it with a specific web page? If so, the URL to that web page? Etc. The more details the better.
-------------------------
browser
Installed uBlock Origin on Chromium on Linux Mint 17.1. Works wonderfully for the first while but I tend to leave Chromium open with multiple windows, each that have multiple tabs. The longer I leave the browser open, the slower it gets until it's clearly struggling to maintain even 10fps. Completely closing down the browser and re opening fixes this problem. Goes away when I disable uBlock.
-------------------------
browser
The first step to validate whether uBlock Origin is responsible for your slow down is to first look at the CPU figures in the browser's Task Manager (Hamburger menu => More tools... => Task Manager). Typically uBO is zero CPU usage when not actively loading web pages. See what in there is showing high CPU usage. If uBO itself is not showing abnormally high CPU usage, then look at which other extensions and/or web pages are showing high CPU usage. For web pages, note the URL and report here.

If you have set your browser to delete cookies at close time, this means all those sites which warns about cookies will warn you again, because they use a cookie to remember that their cookie warning was seen... There are filter lists to dismiss these warning, this may help. One is part of the available filter lists in the "3rd-party filters" pane, it's called: "EU: Prebake - Filter Obtrusive Cookie Notices" The other you can import through the "Custom" area at the bottom of the "3rd-party filters" pane, here is the URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r4vi/block-the-eu-cookie-shit-list/master/filterlist.txt

I right click an image i want to block (maybe it isn't an ad-but I want it blocked anyway), and select block element. Then i can choose the element I want to block, so I click the picture. Nothing happens. This isn't intuititve at all. Adblock and Adblock plus both make it easy to block custom images by just right clicking and selecting adblock in browser.
-------------------------
browser
My request is that you add an option to disable blocking on all pages at the click of a button. The disable option at present only applies to the current page. This doesn't work for cashback sites where you just need to quickly disable blocking everywhere for a few mins. I'm aware I can disable the extension completely, but this is not user friendly in the slightest. I shouldn't need to route into my browser setting all the time.
-------------------------
browser
There is no bug: try your URL in the browser, the remote server returns an error.
-------------------------
browser
Provide the info listed here: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#what-to-include E.g. - exact browser and uBlock Origin versions - Always include a URL, even if "it happens everywhere" - any of uBlock's preferences that differ from the defaults (enabled/disabled filter list) ...
-------------------------
browser
All blockers will cause your browser to warn you about "browsing history". This is not a new permission, this has always been in there since the beginning: no blocker can properly do its job without being able to access the URLs of all network requests. Chrome confuses user by making it sound like it is a new permission, but if you read carefully the warning, it just warns you about *all* permissions. The new required permission is "privacy", and it is used to allow uBlock to enhance privacy-sensitive options in the Settings pane in the dashboard: - to disable IP address leakage through WebRTC - to disable network pre-fetching (which bypass blockers) - to disable hyperlink auditing (which is used to track what you click)
-------------------------
browser
uBlock works not differently than AdBlock: it blocks network requests according to selected filter lists. One thing that will cut the number of cookies is unrelated to uBlock or AdBlock: be sure 3rd-party cookies are disallowed in your browser settings.

If by "crash" you mean "Aww snap!", that's a browser crash, and this should be reported to Chromium devs: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list uBlock is written in javascript, and it's not supposed to crash. If it does, it's a browser bug.

Well apparently there could be a bug in the browser causing this. Related Chromium issue if you want to follow progress: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=515275
-------------------------
browser
I am not aware of any issue which causes uBlock to become disable. There is no code in uBlock to disable itself, so the browser is doing this, or another extension, or something else on your system is tampering with uBlock's installation.
-------------------------
browser
This does not only happen when the browser is restarted. It happens all the time and at random intervals (while the browser is open).
-------------------------
browser
Which browser? (with version (numeric - not just 'latest')) I don't believe "extension disable itself" - it have to be the browser which do the disable. Any message from the browser when the disable happens? I don't have any such problem on: SRWare Iron / IronPortable 35.0.1900.0 (= Chromium 35) Slimjet Browser Portable 3.1.6.0 (Chromium 40.0.2214.93)
-------------------------
browser
Is there any message from the browser about this? Chrome will do this if it detects an extension has been tampered with. You should check your system for malware to be sure: https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=102370
-------------------------
browser
Apparently re-installing the extension solved the issue for many. I don't know why this happens, it's the browser doing this to uBlock. If you reinstall, do not forget to backup your settings first from the "Settings" pabe in the dashboard.
-------------------------
browser
Looks to me like this is a browser bug. This has been reported a couple of times I see. A user opened an issue on GitHub, and he solved it by removing then reinstalling the extension (be sure to back uBlock data first so that you can restore afterward): https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/285
-------------------------

Not sure why this happens. Somebody else reported a similar problem, it appears it's a browser issue. How this was fixed: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/285#issuecomment-108587730

uBlock Origin is an excellent ad-blocker, but new permissions have started configuring my browser for me, disabling network options "for your own protection", a concept in total contravention of its own manifesto that "uBlock's sole purpose is to give users the means to enforce their own choices." I would much prefer to have an option to still enable this setting.
-------------------------
browser
It's for you own protection: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/0.9.8.2 If not disabling "Prefetch resources to load pages more quickly", your browser can still establish remote connection even for blocked network requests, hence your IP address could still be visible to these blocked remote servers. "Prefetch" enabled is a bad setting privacy-wise.

Hi, I've a problem on two separate laptops: Acer Aspire 1680 and Aspire 5630 (I know they're fossils, but hey...) They both run fresh installs of Manjaro Linux (one's 32 bit the other 64). uBlock makes Chrome (43.0.2357.81) extremely unresponsive almost freezes the browser completely. Opera and Firefox aren't affected by this. Let me know if you need any more details (although if I turn uBlock on for testing I'll be looking at a pretty much frozen system).
-------------------------
browser
@Raymond Hill I completely forgot this setting (on my win7 machine I unchecked it ages ago and since then I came to consider it as off by default). Chromium now closes all processes properly while Chrome leaves some behind still. I didn't mean to high-jack your thread for general browser maintenance, but thank you for taking the time to answer. that's very cool of you.
-------------------------
browser
> I have however noticed that there are some chrome/chromium processes that do not get terminated properly when the browser is closed. There is a setting in Chromium to allow background processes to live on after your close the browser. In Chromium the setting is: "[ ] Continue running background apps when Chromium is closed" See if it is un-checked on your side and if this could explain those sticky background processes you see.
-------------------------
browser
@Raymond Hill Thank you for your answer. The 5630 has 3Gb of ram. This lets me open up to ~20 unique pages and ~40 pages if there are multiple subpages from one domain open. I can fill up to around 2,6 Gb without problems. Because of the above and because I'm pretty sure I had just 1 or two pages left open for testing with ublock - I was reluctant at first to consider the ram explanation. I have however noticed that there are some chrome/chromium processes that do not get terminated properly when the browser is closed. This combined with a 'heavier' page could possibly have led to my ram filling up. To be clear about the 'freezing': When ram usage goes above 2,7Gb a combination of things happens: -everything freezes with fractions of seconds when I can move the cursor or -the cursor is responsive but I can't interact with programs or -I can move the cursor and interact with programs but everything is very slow/'jagged' if it makes sense I'm going to try and test some more because when monitoring ram usage I saw clearly that at these numbers of pages at least ublock saves ram (it might depend on the actual pages as well I suppose). If you prefer I can remove my posts from here as I think my interpretation of the source of this issue was wrong.*Let me know once you read this.

Not really. Use your browser script blocking ability for such site where you disable uBlock.

When you say "all the pictures and text", do you mean on web pages, or for the extension UI itself? If it's the extension UI itself, then it appears your installation was damaged, i.e. something on your computer tampered with your browser installation. Re-install uBlock hopefully would work, and if so, you will need to find out what is trashing uBlock. If it's web pages, than you must have created a bad filter or rule. Things to try: - Un-check "I am an advanced user" if it is checked. - Click "Reset to default settings" in the dashboard.
-------------------------

Do you Really want this? Do you read pages in 20 languages? How many ads did you see with only the Default filters? "All filters" will make browser run slower and use more CPU and RAM I did't tested how much but there will be 'some effect' Do you know how many lines there are in EasyList alone? It is written "57,015 used out of 57,048" but take a look and see what have to be parsed/processed: https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt Default filters + 1-2 additional languages is enough for me.

Restart the extension maybe. I've been running that version non-stop and it works fine from here, and I haven't heard of any issue. Sometimes things get flaky after an extension updates, not sure why -- it's a Chrome thing. Restarting the browser and/or forcing a reload of the extension usually fixes these issues.
-------------------------
browser
Not much difference -- maybe this will change in the future. Both perform just the same. I still contribute and will keep contributing important bug fixes to the other (or important core filtering engine functionality if needed). The other uBlock is on a path to support legacy Firefox-based browsers, and also the other uBlock is the one with official support for Safari browsers.

Tjhis happens only if you disallow popups using the "no popups" switch. See:<https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Manually-editing-per-site-switches#caveats>. > Chromium-based browsers: If you block popups everywhere by default (no-popups: * true), this will break "Open link in new tab" in the context menu. This is because of Chrome API limitations
-------------------------
browser
I've never encountered this issue (Chromium here). What browser/version are you using? When you say it goes inactive after a couple of days, is this days without quitting at all the browser? Some other extensions could have the permission to enable/disable other extensions... Do you have such other extension installed?
-------------------------
browser
yes, but is lost when you close the browser
-------------------------
browser
Can you report on Github? https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues Fill the description with details about browser version, filter lists used, all other settings, etc. We need to reproduce the issue in order to investigate, and to reproduce we need to use the same exact set up as yours.

> Wonder why these extensions need to interact with System that much... uBlock/uMatrix are written in javascript. They have nothing to do with the system, and that the Chrome tasks themselves are at zero proves this: uBlock/uMatrix do not bypass the browser, so whenever they do something it shows up in Chrome's own Task Manager.
-------------------------
browser
It's a browser crash, this needs to be reported to Chromium developers. uBlock is written in javascript, javascript cannot cause crashes, browser bugs can cause crashes.

browser
Unfortunately it's a browser behavior, and it doesn't look like there is anything workaround. Longtime ago I tried to internally cache the state of the icon in order to avoid repainting it if it didn't change, but I found out this was not possible to implement because the browser will redraw the icon without first asking the extension (using the default icon in the manifest).

Yes, as per Chromium developers, the issue is likely that a user's browser has been tampered somehow: Excerpt: "At this point we're pretty sure that this error is primarily caused by malware / unwanted software on your machine actively tampering with the contents of the chrome binary and your user profile directory data. [...]" Source: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=391552#c153 So as you suggested, re-installing Chrome apparently help fixes the problem.

When I am watching a long video or keep watching a playlist in full screen without exiting on youtube, the blocking counter keeps increasing. I had times where it was at 700+... I also noticed that this is effecting the performance of the browser. For example, when stopping a video, it can take over 1 second for this to happen. I am very sorry for my bad English xD
-------------------------
browser
It's normal, there is a filter in EasyPrivacy which blocks these Youtube net requests collecting stats which occurs at interval when playing a video on Youtube. The count on the badge is absolutely not detrimental to the browser performance, it just tells the truth about the number of net requests which were blocked. You can rest assured that whatever "1 second" delay you experience when you press stop, it's completely unrelated to uBlock, as uBlock *does not do anything special internally* when you press the stop button. If this still bother you, you can create an exception filter to override the EasyPrivacy filter in order for the requests to not be blocked: "@@||s.youtube.com^" (without the quotes). But my advice is keep the filter, it's part of EasyPrivacy for a reason. The number on the badge is for information purpose, whether the count is low or high has no bearing on uBlock's performance.
-------------------------
browser
I did experienced this once, and restarting the browser (Chromium) fixed the problem. I don't know, it seems sometimes the browser, after running for a very long-time without restarting it can become in some unstable state. uBlock is non-blocking internally, and it's pretty fast at handling its job, so when this happen it more than likely the browser is in a bad state. What is your computer? What the filter count in use as show by uBlock on the "3rd-party filters" tab? I was using a poor 8-year old laptop for the last month, and I could see once in a while "Waiting for uBlock", but that was rare, and I never saw a page hang with "Waiting for uBlock". (I could not run ABP on that laptop, all page load became quite sluggish and laptop fan kicked in high speed all the time).
-------------------------
browser
When I click on ublock in the browser or in the settings page, it directs me to 'page not found.' It's also now a dark gray puzzle piece instead of the uBlock symbol...not sure how to fix this.
-------------------------
browser
Also re. crash: the browser crashes, javascript doesn't crash. If the page crashes with "Aww snap", this needs to be reported to Chromium dev. (I didn't see any crash here).
-------------------------
browser
After using for quite a while, I saw some bugs. When opening Chrome there is a slight delay in blocking ads, often times it doesn't do it's job. The worst thing to do is to refresh the browser a few times to be able for it to remove the ads. I have observed this while browsing on Yahoo! website. Perhaps you can fix the said issues sooner. Thanks
-------------------------
browser
Yes, this has been reported often times. Problem is the browser, by design, can't guarantee that extensions will be fully ready before loading tabs, i.e. extensions can't prevent the browser from loading tabs. So when uBlock launches, it has to load all filters etc, i.e. it needs to do a lot of work before being ready to block ads, but then the browser won't wait or even ask extensions whether they are ready before loading the tabs, it loads the tabs asap after launching the extensions. Improving load performance should help, and this was done with version 0.5.0.0+, which I wish to publish as soon as uBlock get out of "pending review" mode (I am currently not allowed to update it). From there, will see what else I can do to improve further load time, but still, this depends a lot on the amount of lists used, whether "Auto update" is selected, etc. As long as the browser opens tabs without waiting for extensions to be ready this is going to be a recurring problem.

I've been playing a video for 40 minutes now, and the memory footprint of the extension stands at 51MB (Chromium 64-bit with all filter lists selected except regional ones), which is typical given I have forced a reload of the filters by changing my custom filters on top of all this. What other extensions do you have installed? The browser's garbage collector make take longer to kick in when the browser is not idle enough. So if some other extensions are causing higher CPU usage, the browser won't fall into idle mode, and the garbage collector will become lazier. Currently my CPU stands at 5% for the Youtube tab, which seems sufficient for the garbage collector to kick in. Do you have the request log enabled?

What do you call "page crashes"? Is it the "Aw snap!" page? I cannot investigate without more details: steps to reproduce, version browser/extension, other installed extensions, URL addresses where the problem occurs, etc. I haven't seen anybody reporting such behavior so far, so it would seem there is something specific on your side causing this. If it is the "Aw snap!" page, it's really the browser crashing, and unless there is a bug in the browser, javascript can't cause such crash, it's a scripted language.
-------------------------

That would be <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/108>. Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed fix for this one, the browser doesn't wait for extensions to fully load before opening a tab, by design. There might be extensions out there which purpose is to manage tabs, and maybe one of them has a feature to prevent tabs from opening at launch unless you ask for it. I could try to inject content scripts into existing pages, but that would address only the cosmetic filters part (assuming this works anyways). That's the most I can do, here I created an issue for this so you can follow progress: <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/129>
-------------------------
browser
It's a chromium-based browser issue: unfortunately there is no guarantee extensions will be up and running before page loads when launching the browser. Before uBlock can start blocking, it needs to load huge lists of filters, and this takes a while to complete, and the browser won't wait for an extension to finish whatever it's doing. It's by design in chromium.

Was great for years. Then this 'update' appeared at the end of June, and it's been nothing but pain and wasted time ever since. Yes, I've read the "release 1.28.0 notes". No, it does not solve the multitude of problems I now encounter daily across Websites I frequent. In fact, it's now faster and easier to simply turn uBlock completely off.

Addendum: with more experimentation, and starting from scratch (getting rid of YEARS of customized My Filters data), it's a much better experience, mostly due to simply disabling a number of the default Filter Lists that come with uBlock Origin. It seems to be that the combination of "old defaults" and "new block methods" were the crux of the problems I'd experienced. I'm constantly needing to add block rules to my 'new' My Filters & My Rules lists, but at least I don't have to endure what advertising majors call "the modern Web-browsing experience," full of crappy, annoying, MOVING ads, that track us across multitudes of sites.

I can't say whether starting from zero will fix anyone else's issues, but it's certainly worth a try if you've been using uBlock Origin for a very long time, and you've suddenly started having problems with uBlock since late June, making your browsing experience...let's say "irritating."

You can find the the reason for this on:
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Permissions
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Can-you-trust-uBlock%3F

According to uBlock privacy policy: 
"uBlock Origin does not collect any data of any kind;
uBlock Origin has no home server;
uBlock Origin doesn't embed any kind of analytic hooks in its code."
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Privacy-policy

Of course it isn't like all extensions are trustworthy, but being uBlock Origin open source, you can analyze the code by yourself.

Everything was great until I got a different computer. Now Chrome has disabled it because of a change in permissions. Now it says it can *read and change all your data on all websites you visit and *change your privacy related settings. I don't know what this means and don't know if I should enable it again.
-------------------------
data
Any add blocker requires these permissions. How do you want it to hide ads without reading (identifying ads) and changing (disabling download of hiding placeholders of ads) the data on all websites? The "change your privacy related settings" is for disabling prefetch, which might leak some of "side channel" information.

Normally it does not slow down chrome at all... Try This... Start with Clearing the Chrome Browsers History and Cache To do it on the chrome browser (PC) select the ellipsis (3 dots on top of each other) Go to 'MORE TOOLS' then Select 'Clear Browsing Data' A window will pop up and you will have 2 tabs that read Basic and Advanced... Start under the Basic Tab and Select the drop down menu to ALL Time and and make sure everything under that tab is selected with a check mark. Now Select the ADVANCED Tab Do the same thing and select All Time and Check Everything BUT 'Passwords and Signed in Data' (want to make sure you do not delete and passwords! so make sure that box is NOT Checked) Now Select the Button that reads Clear Data ------- Next select the ellipsis (3 dots) and Go under HELP and ABOUT Google Chrome... If your browser is not up to date it will now update. If the issue persists Uninstall Ublock Origins, Repeat the above Steps ... Reboot the PC and reinstall the browser extension...

Please, I need to get the URL data from the FILTER LISTS, i cannot get it from the backup my-ublock-backup_2021-11-16_06.58.22.txt IT Does not contain the latest entries that I need to restore the filter lists. My Google Chrome Crashed and my extensions are bad. I have repaired the EXTENSION it self but I have lost all my FILTER LIST DATA I need to get an USER Entry URL from the actual User files that contains all the entries for the Custom Imported Filter lists which are still in my system restore data entries for Windows. I cannot get it from "my-ublock-backup_2021-11-16_06.58.22.txt" Since it does not have it in there, the only way is manually going into the Working Directory of cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm, but I don't know how your extension is coded, I don't know anything about it only the fact of where the extension installed which is in the DEFAULT/EXTENSIONS/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm So my question to you is where in the working files do I need to go? I need the file name of where Ublock stores any URL information for Custom Imported Scripts There is no option to export or import the Filter Lists, the only way to restore and save that data is via the Settings restore from File / back up from file button. Windows 7 has all the cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm data stored in the Shadowcache which I have access to so I have multiple backups of 'Default' profile. So would cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm folder contain the USER Entered data as well? or do I need to go into another working directory of Google Chrome? If so please let me know which directories I should be looking into to find this data. Kind thanks, EJ

TL;DR: If you hate any kind of telemetry or are a pro-user and know what words "[software] community" mean, you want uBlock Origin. Also, uBlock Origin might occasionally break, especially if you use an unusual Chromium variant. If you want a slightly worse but a very consistent experience in any browser and are willing to compromise some of your privacy in exchange, Adblock Plus might be better for you. In the later case, I'd recommend looking into AdGuard -- a commercial company offering technical support help desk, but with a different financial model: getting money from users, not advertisers. (You may choose to pay for the product, and are guaranteed that you won't become the product.) Their browser extension is free, while the revenue comes from selling "advanced" licenses to users for standalone computers and mobile programs implementing features impossible for an extension. So they do need to sell your privacy to advertisers, and instead rely on money paid by some users. For example, I personally bought lifetime license for Android to have DNSCrypt (encrypted DNS) and I'm really happy with it. Also, both block pretty much the same ads, since all adblockers just follow instructions specified by the filter lists you choose and all lists are maintained by volunteers external to either project, except for Acceptable Ads (maintained by Eyeo GmbH). There are some differences due to uBlock Origin and Adblock Plus having slightly different syntaxes, but most rules are compatible with either one. Adblock Plus is a commercial product from a very financially successful company (its developer Eyeo GmbH pulls in revenue in hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Acceptable Ads, while employing about 100 people). On the other hand, uBlock Origin is completely non-commercial hobby project by a very talented individual (Raymond Hill) in his free time, who believes any financial activity might eventually compromise the primary objective (protect user choice and privacy), and thus does not even have a dedicated website or forum to avoid any financial activity. Adblock Plus offers consistency and limitations of a mass-market commercial product (and takes a bit of your privacy in return, even if you disable Acceptable Ads). uBlock Origin offers complete privacy and is more efficient (from my personal experience and according to all articles online I could find), but if you have a question, you'll go to the user community (a topic on Reddit) and you might be expected to read documentation. Here is some stuff I'd really recommend reading: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Why-don't-you-accept-donations%3F Privacy Policies: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Privacy-policy https://adblockplus.org/en/privacy

At https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/About-the-required-permissions#access-your-data-on-all-web-sites, it says regarding the ""Access your data on all web sites" permission: "To be able to inspect all net requests so that they can be cancelled if needed." I know this has been around since the 1st version; I'm just curious: why would uBlock need to cancel connections? :/ Again, I'm just wondering. Thanks.
-------------------------
data
uBlock's primary purpose is to block **network connections**, not just data transfer. Not blocking the connection while just blocking the data transfer would mean uBlock is lying to users. So this permission will stay, and sorry for those who do not understand that it actually allows uBlock to do its intended job more thoroughly. A blocker which does not thoroughly prevent connections is not a real blocker.

What data would be accessed? I have used ublocko for several months but I decided to uninstall it. The new permission is simply not acceptable. I wish I to have older version installed.

"Access all data" is not new. Read the warning carefully. It has been there since the first release of uBlock, and no blocker can work without this permission.

I'm 99% certain this is new behavior since the change to uBlock Origin. With Chrome OS (both current Stable and Beta channels) if uBlock Origin is enabled, cookies are not being set, even if the settings preference is "Allow local data to be set (recommended)". For a specific example, selecting a preferred library in scholar.google.com is no longer possible. Disabling uBlock restores cookie setting. This is occurring on multiple sites — as far as I can see, any site that attempts to set a local cookie.

No, uBlock is totally not interested in who you are or what you do. There is no data collected. uBlock connects only to remote servers to fetch the filter lists when they need to be updated.

Same thing happened to me after 1.43 was installed. One CPU core would get pinned to 100% and nothing would load just like you said. Disabling the extension would fix it, re-enabling would bring it back... so it was definitely uBlock.

Reinstalling the extension fixed the problem and I was able to restore my settings from the backup without issue. There must be something wrong with the update process.

A review after years of using it:

It is amazing and works great! But let me elaborate on that.

IF you don't know what you're doing, don't do it. I recommend reading the "manual" on github first, if you intend to highly customize it to your liking.

I did not know how to actually use it, for a veeeery long time... I did not know why ads were getting in, on pages and when watching videos(tv shows). And I added tons of custom filters to it, on top of its built-in filters, to force block them. Now, on top of making my PC very slow because of it, the ads were still popping up. And my PC is an R9 3950X with 32GB of RAM...
Well, in my defence, it's built-in filters were not that great in the beginning.

I was always complaining on github about stuff not working, and ending with the creator scolding me........ And everybody was always telling me to restore it to its default settings, use its built-in filters, and never play with the dynamic filters. I didn't understood why, and never listened, I was stubborn.

But this year finally I read the manual for it, and understood why nothing was working. And duh, it was my fault because I played with the dynamic filters when I didn't even know how exactly they work.
Then I restored it to its default settings and only used its built-in filters. And guess what, everything started working as advertised, with no issues. But to add, the built-in filters are way better than they used to be years ago. And more extension updates I guess.

So if people want to use it, I suggest reading its manual on github first. I promise a lot of confusion and things not working, will go away.

Also, this is not an AdBlocker. It may have some filters for blocking Ads, but it is a more advanced tool for blocking page elements and other stuff.

PS: Sorry @gorhill for being an idiot...
-------------------------

Well this was a fast update. Turning on cosmetic filtering fixed it, even though it seems like it should block things like that. Whatever. If anyone else has the same issue maybe try this? Good luck!

- Open Source
- Free
- Does not get paid by other companies to prevent ad blocking

Replace whatever adblock you are using with this.

Why would you disable it on all sites? Wouldn't that be the same as just disabling the extension? Also it's blocking the ad requests before they happen so it will actually speeding up page loads rather than slowing them down.

This used to be the only ad/tracker blocker I would use. But since they change it so you can no longer Green Light (to allow) a certain website I no longer use it. Sometimes uBlock blocks links that needs to run, and being able to easily change the permission from red to green was very helpful. I REALLY hope they but that feature back. Until then I will be using a different extension.

The update 7/25 killed it. Youtube ads and pages slow to load. What happened?

Hear about the feature on tiktok from a content and the person said that it would block all ads on YouTube, it doesn't block the ad at all it keep causing Chrome to crash and i have to reinstall Chrome 100x to get it to work again so I came back to the chrome web store and looked up the extension again. this is what I found out "uBlock Origin is not an "ad blocker", it's a wide-spectrum content blocker with CPU and memory efficiency as a primary feature." so basically it does nothing at all to block any ads on YouTube so this tiktok content person lied to me and a lot of other people sad
-------------------------

Pls , make it more fast .Sometimes , it is blocking websites designs or graphical content .As a result , it is awful to see a website without any graphical content .
Btw, it is the best adblocker I have ever seen , but it should need more improvement .

After uBlock Origin superseded Adblock Plus on my computers for almost a year now I almost forgot what ads were....until today 12/3/2019 when I noticed terribly slow browser performance when using Google Chrome. Not sure if there was an update/change.

I honestly thought it was an issue with my internet/router at first but after a few test I can confirm the issue lies with the extension. Symptoms I am experiencing are extremely slow page loads no matter the website. This especially happens when using incognito mode and will at time's cause the browser to become unresponsive when trying to change uBlock Origin's extension settings when it is enabled. Issue disappear's after disabling the uBlock Origin extension.

As with everything in life, I get hiccups can happen but uBlock Origin is definitely a cut above the rest. Hope this get's fixed soon so I can continue to enjoy no ad/pop up life once again! Thanks for what you do!

Lately it's having EXTREME CPU usage. Nothing will load. I kill the process in Task Manager for Google Chrome with the CPU usage and it kills uBlock which immediately fixed the issue. Exact same results when I remove ublock and everything that won't load loads instantly, same problem when adding it back. This IS a problem with latest version of uBlock. Not sure the problem but it doesn't work anymore. Maybe it has a virus.

This has been the best for years, but until this problem is fixed, it cannot be used.

What an extension !!! . I have used a lot of ad-blockers but none of them work like U-block origin. They were using high amount of RAM in my system. Sites which consist of too many ads are usually slowed down with those ad-blockers. Also, it doesn't participate in acceptable-ads program. I'm using slimjet browser with in-built ad-blocker. But I disabled that ad-blocker and downloaded ublock origin because that ad-blocker was creating above problems. I love it.

By just using it a few minutes I can already tell this is my new adblocker. I was in my fury using three of the classic adblockers before this one, at the same time. But since they still let some annoying ads through and let a website seemingly mine my CPU I had enough and went looking for something exactly like uBlock Origin. It'll be only days and everyone I know will be using this one too. Thanks!

Okay, so I never leave reviews, but I 100% felt the need to for this extension. I seriously made a Google+ profile (which I will probably never use again) just to write this. 

Before installing, my CPU was at 85-100%, which is what it typically is for me when I use chrome. After having it installed for, no joke, less than five minutes, my CPU went down to 8-15%. I'm so shook. 

Just to test it out, I went to kisscartoon (one of the worst websites for ads). With adblocker, you still get the occasional popup, but with this, there was NOTHING. Never got an ad once. 

Checked my CPU after watching an episode of South Park, and still was at 8-15%. 

never using adblocker again.

So far really happy with it,total control and light on RAM ,running windowsXP,but not on chrome,rather on Flashpeak Slimjet ,the best for my use browser,and on on linux(antix)with similar performance.

This extension blocks nearly all ads and speeds browsing up tremendously on my old computer.  It also disables anti-adblock on many pages.

However, it misses some pop-ups; install Poper blocker for that.
-------------------------
slow
It's better than nothing  now that ABP is going to add ads of their choosing for a revenue source. I only moved back to ABP because it  handled pop-ups better,  the element blocker seemed to be much better. 

Here if I set an element to be blocked with wildcards(*), it is only for the session. If I come back or refresh the page, those elements get reloaded.

I wish they would block Facebook ads like Fluffybuster Purity does but FBP can slow down how any website can load because it reads your feeds much like how uBlock works and filters content. 

I can use the element blocker to hide a specific ad, but on page reload, the ad is back. So it's kinda pointless. 

That is where ABP shines. Elements blocked stay blocked regardless of how many times the page is reloaded, but where they pale is their ability to intercept pop-ups and pop-unders.
-------------------------

It's not blocking every ad it lets some in just like ad block plus does probably accepting bribes just like they are. Also slows down webpage loading.

DOES NOT BLOCK ALL PARTS OF ELEMENTS ON PAGES ANYMORE.

The good
• I love it. It is owned and supported by a friendly community. Not a corporation. More secure because its code is publicly available for review and contributions on GitHub at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
• Easy to use. With both basic or advanced modes.
• Lightweight on memory and CPU resources
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome
• Clear Manifesto:
......• The user decides what web content is acceptable or not in their browser.
......• The uBlock project does not support Adblock Plus' "Acceptable Ads Manifesto", because the "Acceptable Ads" marketing campaign is really the business plan of a for-profit entity.
......• Users are best placed to know what is or is not acceptable to them. uBlock's sole purpose is to give users the means to enforce their own choices.
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome.
• Lots of features
• uBlock Origin has a better track record at fully protecting your privacy, than AdBlock Plus (ABP). There is a controversy around ABP and its related for profit corporation trying to monetize ABP via ad whitelisting. Which means that corporation sales your privacy for profit :( Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adblock_Plus#Controversy_over_ad_filtering_and_ad_whitelisting

The bad
• Confusion with the names. Between "uBlock Origin" and "uBlock". For those not familiar with those names, uBlock Origin is better than uBlock. Mostly because as of May 2017 Ublock Origin is still actively maintained and updated. Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin#uBlock_.28ublock.org.29uBlock Compare to uBlock which as not been maintained and updated for more than 2 years, since 2015, and is trying to monetize an open source project.

Skynet level efficiency, Terminator level blocking!

All with incredibly low system resource footprint- save power and free up your CPU cycles!

This is the ad-blocker you want!  
Best browser-level ad-block I've seen. Install and it works. With an additional 60 seconds you can configure it and subscribe to more known & maintained ad-network lists. On top of this, it's one-click-easy to backup & export your settings and subscriptions in case you need to import them to another PC.

If you aren't using this, walk away from your PC...

I switched from Adblock Plus after I gave this a chance and found it to be less hassle & more effective. Keep up the great work! I also dislike the idea of allowing specific types of ads even if they play by the rules since I support a truly free and open internet. Nothing wrong with web developers making money, But banners and video ads etc are simply annoying and need to die out. My bandwidth is better spent on loading relevant content instead of making money for some developer that only wrote click-bait to lure me for advertising purposes. I might be stingy on bandwidth but when you have satellite internet which is slow and limited you would understand.

Ever since Adblock became part of the "acceptable ads program" it has completely gone downhill. I don't mind seeing an ad here or there but after a few months the ads became incredibly invasive and obstructive. (obviously the point of me downloading adblock was to you know... block ads...) Becoming more and more frustrated I decided to try out uBlock. It is what adblock was and should have remained being. No ads, no fluff, no annoying popups or surveys or flashing lights on the side of your articles now. Say goodbye to the 3 minute ad you have to watch before viewing a 18 second clip on youtube. Do yourself a favor and uninstall the horse manure called adblock and switch to uBlock

UBlock Origin is currently the best overall set-it-and-forget-it ad blocker/general-purpose blocker browser extension with the lowest RAM and CPU usage in my opinion, and it is the only one that I have used so far that can block most annoying pop-up ads.

Switched from ABP (adblock plus) to this wonderful new ad blocker. Why did I switch? I didn't have an issue with the "acceptable ads" program (where ads in a certain size range and unobtrusive behavior were allowed) - it was because the element picker was half functional. The element picker lets you block completely the additional stuff websites have. On many risky sites, ABP's element picker simply did not work. It refused to work on certain sites that made a large income off visitors. Then it was a cpu hog and I got tired of it (because google chrome is very heavy on my cpu as well). 

UBlock origin's element picker has no restrictions at all. Works on every site I've come across. And tested it side by side with ABP. It's smaller cpu usage is a nice bonus too. I'm praying these folks don't sell out either!

This is a great ad blocking extension that is effective and very light on resources.

But one long standing gripe remains is that the Element Hiding function is very poor.

If for example you block a page element and that same element is shown again in multiple locations on the webpage or domain.

This really needs to be able to block all similar items or block parent items across similar pages or entire domains.

There has been many complaints about its deficiencies.

The developer needs to  realise there are issues with uBlock Origin that really do need prompt attention.

Please try and listen to constructive comments made and improve future development of uBlock Origin.

This good extension could be even better than it is now.

When this has much improved Element HIding I will revise my review and I'll only be too happy to give it a 5 star rating.

I bet that this can even survive Youtube Red(TM). AdBlock (Ad friendly, Ebola Edition) won't see the light of day after Redtu... I mean Youtube Red.
Edit: So yeah, this survived YouTube Red (I guess they didn't block people yet). Anyway, this is the only adblock that hasn't sold out to AD+'s monopolistic intentions ("acceptable ads" yeah like viruses are "acceptable" as well right?), and runs superior to that extension.

This adblocker is the best. People talking about Ad Blocker plus etc. They need to checkout ublock origin. This app is easy on your CPU.

Great for speed but this extension blocked the menus on quite a few websites.  The menus would only work after disabling uBlock but they work fine with ABP.  Sadly, I'll need to go back to the more memory hungry ABP since enabling/disabling uBlock on various sites is just more work than an adblocker should require.

Significantly reduced memory usage vs ABP even with many more filters enabled.  Reduced CPU usage, reduced load times.

ABP was revolutionary for its time, but now it's been surpassed.

And it blocks everything and anything I'd need it to, just as much as Adblock or Adblock Plus have done for me in the past.

Props to gorhill, good work!

Fast, slim, small and effective.
One of few addons that brings a real meaning to "µ" (micro)
 
But there is one feature I miss, and are a dealbreaker for me:
Being able totemporarily disable it alltogether.
I can temporarily disable µblock for the current site, but as soon as I click on an ad that IS interesting, trying to open a new window, it's blocked despite that µblock is temporarily disabled.

I have to turn the addon off completely, and restart the browser in order to click on that interesting ad.

Fast but overly zealous blocker. Blocks much more than ads, like Google Analytics, Google and Facebook-based single sign-ons, etc.

I just want an ad blocker.

Yesterday my chrome suddenly became so slow it was unusable. All other browsers were fine but Chrome could not load any web pages fully. I narrowed the cause down to ublock being turned on. Only after turning it off did my chrome work normally again. It its current state the extension is unusable

For a while now, uBlock has been slowing down my Chrome startup. I'm certain of this because by disabling the extension, Chrome's startup is much faster. What is it due to?
-------------------------

Normally it does not slow down chrome at all... Try This... Start with Clearing the Chrome Browsers History and Cache To do it on the chrome browser (PC) select the ellipsis (3 dots on top of each other) Go to 'MORE TOOLS' then Select 'Clear Browsing Data' A window will pop up and you will have 2 tabs that read Basic and Advanced... Start under the Basic Tab and Select the drop down menu to ALL Time and and make sure everything under that tab is selected with a check mark. Now Select the ADVANCED Tab Do the same thing and select All Time and Check Everything BUT 'Passwords and Signed in Data' (want to make sure you do not delete and passwords! so make sure that box is NOT Checked) Now Select the Button that reads Clear Data ------- Next select the ellipsis (3 dots) and Go under HELP and ABOUT Google Chrome... If your browser is not up to date it will now update. If the issue persists Uninstall Ublock Origins, Repeat the above Steps ... Reboot the PC and reinstall the browser extension...

I had just gotten this issue now too. When uBlock Origin is ON, and I try to access anything on the internet or even local network, it just pushes my CPU to 100% and it just gets stuck on the loading animation (loading circle) and just sits there. When uBlock Origin is OFF, chrome works fine.

The trend I am seeing now is that many sites are fighting anti-stalkers and privacy tools. I don' allow Google Fonts because it tells Google where I am, what site I'm on, what time, from where and for how long. With most web sites, built on generic templates that already include Googleware, Fonts are a easy means for Google to record which sites we were on, and where we went. Now, many icons don't show up unless I drop my right to privacy. DuckDuck and startpage - so called purveyors of private browsing, use remote Fonts leaked my IP when I used BOTH privacy essentials. Some pages showed up as the old 1995 HTML style layouts, destroying and friendly navigation. Not much help I know, but maybe if you did a process of illumination, that is, use both, try several of the WWW sites, if you can get to a foreign site by circumventing the GDPR pervert and then close browser, unload uBlock and just use DDG's essentials. See how it goes. IMHO, it would be like having 2 cops for security at the door to house. They both seem suspicious so they use your resources to frisk each other, slowing down in/out. We have locks on our doors, and drapes, curtains and blinds on our windows but when we step into the Internet, we run naked - why?

After reinstalling the system and Google Chrome browser, it appears that new tabs are loading extremely slow with UBlock Extension on, and that's quite annoying. What can that be? The hardware acceleration and other possible interruptors in Chrome settings are currently off. And everything works fine except UBlock. I want to use your extension on daily basis, and I used it without any trouble before. But now there's some kind of malfunctioning. Could that be my system, browser, both or somewhat else? I'm currently using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with latest version of Chrome (Not Chromium, but standard GC itself).

You are looking for uBlock Origin Dashboard > "Settings" > "Privacy" section, specifically "Disable pre-fetching (to prevent any connection for blocked network requests)" and, may be (unlikely), "Disable hyperlink auditing". I'd recommend reading about these options and considering privacy drawbacks vs. load speed improvements (by clicking "i" icons next to them and on the uBlock Origin Wiki). Here are the docs: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Settings#privacy

This is intentional (limitations of Yandex Android Browser API). Yandex Android Browser does not allow network filtering directly (does not have API for that), but instead allows extensions to register filters with it and then it will enforce these filters on its own. Therefore it requires special version of ad blocker (more accurately, merely a filter list manager), such as "Adguard Content Blocker" (not regular AdGuard) or "Adblock Fast" or something like that. More details: https://yandex.com/support/browser-mobile-android-tablet/useful-features/api-for-ad-blockers.html#switch-on-off DISCLAIMER: I did not ever use neither of "Adguard Content Blocker" nor "Adblock Fast" and thus can not recommend either of them.

Hi, First off, thank you for this incredible extension, it's easily the best ad-blocker I've ever used. But I have a website that won't let me read its content unless I disable it.

I don't think this is what was intended, so I'm reporting it as a problem. I just noticed yesterday when I had a Google Doc open that the blocked ad count was steadily climbing the longer I worked in that tab. I finally opened the logger, and it appears that each time the document auto-saves, uBlock is counting it as a blocked ad. That's fine, except that once it gets over 500 or so it starts to slow the browser down a bit. Not a lot, just a little, but again, I don't think that's supposed to be happening. It happens in Google Sheets, too. If I refresh the tab it resets the counter, but that's annoying to have to do.

UBlock Origin will slow down page loading speed guaranteed. Proof: visit any page and load up Devtools > Network. Page resource timing is noticeably skewed. It happens on whitelisted sites, too. The developer knows this and hates when people blame his extension, calling them "trolls" and referring to their reviews as "completely baseless" and "unsubstantiated claim". I'm 99% certain the developer himself is a troll who spends a lot of time trying to game the system.
-------------------------
speed
You are still not providing *any* exact methodology/result figures, and whatever little information you provide flies in the face of common sense: To claim that "adblock" with default settings pages load faster than uBO with default settings is just complete nonsense. "Adblock" (whichever one you talk about) barely block anything with default settings, and the biggest factor which contributes to page load speed is all the bloat which is blocked. So to block less will always translate into slower page load. Also uBlock has ceased development months ago, and as such does not benefit any of the improvements brought into uBO, *including* performance improvement. So your claims is not only unsubstantiated, you keep stalling when asked for *details*, and your secret results/methodology make no sense and contradict findings from other sources, for example: https://www.raymond.cc/blog/10-ad-blocking-extensions-tested-for-best-performance/ At this point I can't conclude anything else than that you are trolling. Such statements as "reborn UBlock from you" supports that you are just trolling: uBlock Origin is the original uBlock as I envisioned it. Good trolling job, you got me to waste time to respond to you.
-------------------------

I'll give you a link that I can guarantee shows ads every time you load the page when you disable uBlock origin so you can test that it's a uBlock/filter issue, or another reason that isn't uBlock related. There are quite a few reasons you would not see ads even when hitting uBlocks power button. I will explain these other possible reasons. But first, open twitch.tv in another tab. If you already have one open, that's fine too. Just make sure that the power button is 'ON', aka uBlock is blocking ads on twitch. Now go here, with uBlock turned ON: www.twitch.tv/esl_csgo/v/25893492 You should see a screen that says "we are currently playing ads, gameplay is paused until ads are over." Sit there and wait for 10-15 seconds. Sit there until you realize this screen isn't an ad. just how they 'punish' adblockers/ensure people they can watch ads and the gameplay is paused. So, you got 10+ seconds of this dumb screen. Power button 'ON' works correctly then. Now hit the power button 'OFF'. Hit CTRL+F5 to force refresh a new noncached version of the page, but F5 by itself is probably fine too. Video loads to the same screen, and ads start playing in the main window after 1-2 seconds, and usually another one pops up in the top right above the 'more videos' section. If you saw only the boring screen the first time, and you saw ads the second time the page loaded after you hit F5 to refresh (you MUST refresh for this test!) Then uBlock is working just fine. Now, for some other explanations: Not everybody's channel shows ads on entry (pre-roll ads). It's an option, not everybody has it either. And not everybody who has it uses it. Its the most annoying and intrusive ad style. and he best way to get yourself adblocked. Nobody wants to sit there for 90 seconds just to see if that hot grill streamer in the preview is actually a professional comp. player, or just extremely high-skilled. Kappa. For ads during the middle of a broadcast, like between games, or streamer has to poop, or the pizza guy is at his door, so broadcaster clicks 'play ad' as they leave -- for these ads the broadcaster must be partnered with Twitch. They will have the $4.99 subscribe button under their video if they are partnered. If they don't, they can't play ads either, and probably dont have their pre-rolls enabled, they want viewers to come in to a small channel as fast as possible so they can evnetually get the viewernumbers to become partnered. ^ tl;dr - Smaller streamers without sub buttons can't play ads. If it's a streamer with a sub button who says 'im gonna play some ads please disable adblock i would appreciate it", you clicking the power 'off' real fast? No, sorry, you're not going to 'catch it in time' to see the ad. Natural stream delay, and often the page needs a refresh after clicking the power off as well. Additionally, if you are just looking at the twitch.tv frontpage, ads don't play on the 'featured' streams when you load the page. Most of the twitch ad rules are in the regular "Easylist" subscription, if you'd like to take a closer look. But I think its probably working as intended. Cheers :^)

I don't have any "wonderful work" on uBlock Origin, I'm just a user. Raymond Hill is the author. I don't know all the details about lists, but: - it is obvious that if some checked list show "0 used of XXXX" you can un-check it (because all lines in it are already present in some other list) - I don't think you will see any slowdown if you keep redundant lists checked - I think uBlock Origin will use the same amount of RAM and CPU during browsing. The only little slowdown may be at browser start - and you can try to measure it several times with many lists checked and then with only Fanboy+Easylist-Merged checked.

Referring to used hardware resources (CPU) which of the above two alternatives is better to use: -All Fanboy lists + All EasyLists OR - Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List 2. Referring to number of blocking lines which alternative of the two ones is more often updated and have more blocked lines? -All Fanboy lists + All EasyLists OR -Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List ? 3. Is it better to use both of the two alternatives regarding the first two questions? Thank you very much.
-------------------------

The first step to validate whether uBlock Origin is responsible for your slow down is to first look at the CPU figures in the browser's Task Manager (Hamburger menu => More tools... => Task Manager). Typically uBO is zero CPU usage when not actively loading web pages. See what in there is showing high CPU usage. If uBO itself is not showing abnormally high CPU usage, then look at which other extensions and/or web pages are showing high CPU usage. For web pages, note the URL and report here.

I switched to microblock because of promises of lower cpu overhead and no BS that is commonly found in other blocking extensions. This update pisses me off. I do not want you to protect me by disabling or enabling privacy settings. I can handle this on my own. Stop the B.S.

Do you Really want this? Do you read pages in 20 languages? How many ads did you see with only the Default filters? "All filters" will make browser run slower and use more CPU and RAM I did't tested how much but there will be 'some effect' Do you know how many lines there are in EasyList alone? It is written "57,015 used out of 57,048" but take a look and see what have to be parsed/processed: https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt Default filters + 1-2 additional languages is enough for me.

I did experienced this once, and restarting the browser (Chromium) fixed the problem. I don't know, it seems sometimes the browser, after running for a very long-time without restarting it can become in some unstable state. uBlock is non-blocking internally, and it's pretty fast at handling its job, so when this happen it more than likely the browser is in a bad state. What is your computer? What the filter count in use as show by uBlock on the "3rd-party filters" tab? I was using a poor 8-year old laptop for the last month, and I could see once in a while "Waiting for uBlock", but that was rare, and I never saw a page hang with "Waiting for uBlock". (I could not run ABP on that laptop, all page load became quite sluggish and laptop fan kicked in high speed all the time).
-------------------------
cpu
I've been playing a video for 40 minutes now, and the memory footprint of the extension stands at 51MB (Chromium 64-bit with all filter lists selected except regional ones), which is typical given I have forced a reload of the filters by changing my custom filters on top of all this. What other extensions do you have installed? The browser's garbage collector make take longer to kick in when the browser is not idle enough. So if some other extensions are causing higher CPU usage, the browser won't fall into idle mode, and the garbage collector will become lazier. Currently my CPU stands at 5% for the Youtube tab, which seems sufficient for the garbage collector to kick in. Do you have the request log enabled?

Works just as intended. Sometimes it'll block something that's a pop-up but not a malicious one, like the smaller pop-up Google Translate on websites in other languages. But you can click a button where it'll tell you that it blocked the pop-up and to simply click there to allow it if you're looking for a fix. Also one of the only extensions I've found that offer Anti-Tracking, Ad-Blocking, and a Smart Blocking option all for free! Would recommend.

I really do not like the purple overlay at the bottom right hand corner of the screen that lists blocked trackers.  There is seemingly no way to turn it off.  This means that this program, designed to block unwanted content, injects its own unwanted content.  Please give us an option to hide the reporting of blocked trackers.

Thanks for creating this. Unlike ad block and abp, ghostery already blocks all for you.
-------------------------

I'm sorry, what I meant by the "per se" is that while Ghostery does indeed block most ads, it does not "clean up" the space used by them as well (or at all) like the other popular ad blockers, nor does it allow you to pick and block whatever elements you want on a page.
-------------------------

I was using Ghostery when David Cancel was the primary developer. I was concerned when it was taken over by The Better Advertising Project, due to the company publicly admitting it was working with advertisers.

A massive positive during this period is that I worked with one of their representatives, over Firefox's addon forum and through email, to address problems in their Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. The person was responsive and the company made positive changes to their policies.

Fast forward to 2019 and all that I can say is: Wow. I'm surprised that people still use this extension/addon. Has anybody actually read the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use that Cliqz provides for their services? Has anybody thought about the amount of pure trust put into using something like this?

Can Cliqz intercept your personally identifiable information before it enters their proxy network, called The Human Web? Is it technically possible and the company just asks you to trust them that your information is never collected?

When it inserts ads into your browsing experience, how does it know what ads to give you? The ads would be ineffective if improperly administered, e.g., as a male, I would not respond to female product ads.

There are financial reasons that this product has been bought and sold a few times and it's certainly not because the developers want to completely protect the user. Personal data profiles and data sets are extremely valuable in today's market and Ghostery is one way to get that information.

Ghostery might have been a good idea, but it seems as if David Cancel developed it specifically to get investment dollars with the express goal to sell the products (your and my data).

I really like and have used Ghostery for years, but I am very concerned about the new "Smart blocking" "feature" which I recommend that you turn off.
Why? Because while Ghostery's intent may have been to offer better functionality and speedier browsing for users through "artificl intelligence", the "smart blocking" feature appears to completely override all of your current settings in a way that is non-transparent and very hostile to privacy.
Evidence? Visit Lastpass.com with all trackers blocked and smart blocking turned on. Check out the detailed view for a long list of advertising and analytics trackers automatically and quietly  "unblocked" - you will be shocked.
-------------------------
protect
I like the protection the extension offers and I am pleased with most of the operation and settings.  The one thing I would really like to turn off is the popup in the lower right corner of each page.  I am sure that several people like this, but I find it annoying.  I would prefer the application just works instead of notifying me every time I load a page, follow a link to a new page on the same site or just researching something through hundreds of pages.  I checked the extension settings and I did not find a way to turn this off.  Closing it only makes things worse as I have to interact with it and it just comes back on the next page or new tab.  I would rather a popup only if there is a problem.
-------------------------
protect
Normally, for extra protection when surfing the web, a user might turn to incognito mode. But in incognito mode only ensures that your browsing history is not stored on your computer, but the data still trickles out to these third parties like google or facebook. Can this add-on stop those third parties from having our data ?

Thank you for this useful information.

I just read that Google pays Ad blocking companies 30% of their additional revenues to allow ads. I wanted to find out if Ghostery accepts payments to unblock ads. I can't tell that, but if it was bought by an advertising company, it's obvious they are accepting payments and probably collecting user data to inject ads.

Today is my last day with them.

Used to love this ad-on.  But recently its becoming harder and harder to use.  And now, today, Ghostery is showing me that there are 17 trackers on a site, and yet, when I click on Ghostery, to adjust which ones its blocking, it only allows me to adjust 3!  Why this was thought to be a good idea I don't know, but I need to be able to adjust pages as they come.  Uninstalling.

Ghostery Review and experience in Chrome: Extension was okay but prevented some sites from loading. No problem: In this case I disabled the extension for a short while. Since a few months now, ghostery itself pushes ads to my screen - so called Ghostery Rewards.

Deinstalled and will never reinstall.

First i have to put that Ghostery is one of the best "Ad SPAM Blocker" i have used.

I only use Ghostery on sites that bombard me with Ads that take more time to load Ads than the content i am looking for.

The main reason i am only give 4 stars out of 5 is because there use to be advance settings for adjusting which Ad to block or allow for Ghostery that were easy to use but now there is a watered down in setting that only allows me to use default or block.

And because i cannot customize these some sites are breaking, mostly on sites comments.

*Update* Few minutes after posting this, I sill wanted to mess with Ghostery and i was able to fix the comment issue. I tested it with a few sites and it is working for me. 

I had to disable the Enhanced Ad Blocking *Which is the shield button* and only in detailed display disable what I don't want to see.

So now 4 out of 5 until Enhanced Ad Blocking is improved.

Suddenly Uploads are being blocked. Disabled every extension, one at at time, it was Ghostery. Always worked flawlessly before, January 2019 it started blocking BUFFER app (Social Media Scheduling) and Tweetdeck (Twitter) from uploading images. There was nothing in the settings to alter, tried reset of Chrome, which worked until Ghostery started, then uploading was being blocked again from my own computer.  (PC)  Chrome, AVG, and Malwarebytes were running and unaffected. All other sources including Windows Defender were not the problem. Cannot use it until that problem gets addressed. Turned it off 4 minutes ago and suffering serious withdrawals and popups ;)

Ghostery was one of my top favorite apps, but no more...  I feel betrayed on a deep level by Ghostery... For about a month now, another one of my pop up blocker has been going crazy asking if I want to block a popup, just by clicking on nothingness on sites, even my own college sites at them, and when allowed I got taken to a random ad site.... I thought it was malware at first cause it was effecting .org sites even.... Then I accused the very pop up blocker warning me, but when I turned it off, I was suddenly sent to these ad sites automatically with no defence.... Luckily I only had a few extensions and after trail and error, I was left in disbelief at Ghostery, turned it off, and the problem's gone.... Ghostery, an extension designed to help you, has turned into an internal ad program... I feel betrayed and depart with a goodbye.

I've used Ghostery for years but will no longer.
The newest update, even when websites are marked trusted, ghostery would disable crucial javascript for uploading content via file explorer to any website.
An example is if you go to imgur and go to upload a file and click the browse button to what's supposed to open a file explorer window to all you to select the file(s) you wish to upload. After spending considerable time troubleshooting, I discovered the Ghostery extension was causing the Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT Console errors preventing the javascript opening a window to upload files. This mind you, was for ANY button on ANY website (I tested everything from major websites to edu websites). I mean.. I didn't have to once I discovered the issue was Ghostery but before that when troubleshooting I did. I will never use Ghostery again for Google Chrome... and with features Chrome has added you don't need to anymore.. so really neither should anyone else. Again, even with a website marked as trusted (which I doubled checked again with Ghostery re-installed) Ghostery still preventing this safe and normal javascripts from loading which enable the ability to upload files via a file browser window.

As of 28/11/2018 Ghostery prevents middle button clicks and Ctrl/Command + Click from opening new pages, with no option to adjust the behavior.

Am working in Digital Marketing, used this extension for almost 3 years, recently, it started to block the trackers automatically, and stop the platform from being loaded (especially Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform). And many times I have to click trust site to resume the load. This problem is so annoying. I know the intention of this extension is to block any unwanted trackers, but just not after I clicked trust site, it still attempted to block it. Please check out this issue, this create a very bad user experience for me.
-------------------------
block
Be very careful. It used to be really aggressive out of the box to block trackers. Now, it's being sneaky and allowing certain trackers to follow you in the name of attempting to enhance the user experience. I half wonder if they are "white listing" trackers just like Ad Blocker did a while back. Just be careful with this extension;  they are not fully what they let on to be. I use other means to augment rather than solely depending on this extension. I noticed that unless you black list a site manually, you may not get 100% blocking of trackers that it finds. Highly frustrating that you don't get what's advertised.
-------------------------
block
Hey Martin,

No Trackers are whitelisted. The Smart blocking feature is designed to fix the "page break" issue that many users complained about.. if the tracker takes longer than 3 seconds to load we unblock it so there is no page disruption. You can turn that off and no longer have that available, but there may be issues with the page functionality.

It's a good plugin for blocking scripts, 3rd party web stuff, beacons, trackers and the likes, easy to use though I started to find the changes to the UI were a bit unnecessary.
You should be able to install this on multiple browsers on multiple devices, sign in with the same account and have your settings synced, but it kept signing me out more times than I could be bothered to sign back in.

It is good for blocking scripts but it creates problem with google dev tool. I can not inspect element using google dev tools when this is active. All tags are collapsed in the dev tool.

If I pause this extension or disable it, then everything works fine, I mean google dev tool works fine and I can inspect any html tags in the dev tool.

Please fix this.

PS. I will give you 5 stars once this issue is fixed.

I configured - "Block everything" with the initial configuration screen. However, it isn't proving effective against the menace of Auto-playing Videos still !?

As you scroll down the page, the embedded Video starts playing all of a sudden & that too without our consent!

 Secondly, the left click on the Ghostery icon isn't showcasing the "About" option anywhere to catch hold of the current version no. instantly!

The current version must go mentioned at the Top of its tiny interface - which  opens up when left mouse click is pressed against its icon on the toolbar.

Got all excited when I saw that ver 8.062 was out, and hopeful that I could once again begin using Ghostery.

Absolutely useless, and what a disappointment. This app used to work very well, but now it not only bogs down loading IMMENSELY, sometimes they flat out don't load.
Ontop of that, I noticed it wasn't even blocking anything at one point. Still saw ads and more still getting through despite me disabling it.

Please don't get this. I know you want a safe browsing experience, but Ghostery just isn't what it used to be.

TERRIBLY slow extension which dramatically slows the load time for all my sites, getting a "Waiting for Ghostery" message in the status bar all the time. Even on Trusted sites. This should NOT be. If not for this, I would have given at least 4/5. Please fix!

Furthermore, this extension fails to actually prevent the download of blocked JavaScript. Preventing JavaScript from running is something Chrome can do by itself. I was to flat out deny the scripts from even being downloaded to my machine.

Some say that Ghostery, Inc. plays a dual role in the online advertising industry. Ghostery blocks sites from gathering personal information. But it does have an opt-in feature GhostRank that can be checked to "support" them. GhostRank takes note of ads encountered and blocked, and sends that information back to advertisers so they can better formulate their ads to avoid being blocked.

The extension is beyond unusable now. Though the blocking and related things work with some performance slowdown compared to how it was before, they have REMOVED all export and import options and are forcing you to use their new account system to sync whitelisted sites and so on which DOES NOT WORK. Sites DO NOT SYNC and worse still, all whitelists you had previously are removed. Not to mention totally turning scummy and now collecting browsing and custom tracker info by default to sell to advertisers which you have to disable.

 It is utterly useless and I suggest you use ublock origin with their privacy lists.

Not sure what's going on with this product now. It used to work great! Was simple, easy to use, and did what it claimed. Now they forced a new version an all users which isn't working for most. I get the "blank box of doom" that others have mentioned in the comments. I have the latest version of Chrome, and when I remove and re-add Ghostery, it takes me to a page to install the product. When I then click on this page's link, it takes me back to the Chrome web store where I'm took I already have it "added to Chrome"!
That, in addition to the obnoxious purple box displacing the discrete dark box of last versions. It's bulkier than before, and impossible to ignore.
And finally, on my Mac (which it's working with fine) it shows in the purple box some trackers as still unblocked, even though my settings show that all trackers are blocked.
I'm giving two stars because this has been a great product in the past and I have hope it will get better. Also, for some people this will work okay, but probably not great as it did before.
Ghostery, please listen to your users and take their advice! More communication wouldn't help, such as a message pushed out before this last big update giving some advance notice and tips on the new setup. I recognize you have to make money somehow and this new version provides subscription options, but no one will trust the product and want to subscribe if they fell disappointed in the direction you are headed.

A must for Chrome or any browser. 

As you must stay informed about the information you are freely giving out.

Protect your cookies, browsing tendencies and block the offending trackers.

Takes a bit to set up in going through the different websites. 

Being honest there are a few sites that I simply won't visit due to all of the trackers that must be allowed to view their sites. 

>>The bad thing<< 
There were a several sites where I was (past tense) a paid user. And those sites wanted more from me than my monthly subscription. All five sites had the most trackers giving/selling my personal information.

I’ve been using Ghostery since forever, but this new update has rendered this extension pointless. Why? Because they've sold out to the trackers, that’s why. And you better believe it too. If you doubt this, then why, when all other blocking extensions (Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin and Disconnect) are disabled, does Ghostery not detect and block Google Analytics? Why, when all other blocking extensions are disabled, does it not find any trackers on Facebook? Both Google and Facebook base their entire business model on tracking you across the internet, yet Ghostery is now waving them on through unchallenged. Take Mashable as another example. I don’t have the exact numbers, but their pages would return 30+ trackers with the old Ghostery. How many now? Nine. Yeah, something fishy going on there.

And they are really extracting the urine with this new ‘sign in for more features’ bull. People block trackers to be more secure, anonymous and to be less targeted online. So how does creating a personally identifiable account, which can be cross referenced with tracker blocking habits, which can be cross referenced with browsing habits, make anyone more secure?

And why do Ghostery’s settings now redirect to the external URL https://extension.ghostery.com/en_GB/settings and not internally to Chrome. It makes no sense.

Maybe they forget that their target audience tends to be of the tinfoil hat variety, maybe they don’t care. The developers have to pay the bills as does everyone else. But who cares about that when the extension no longer delivers on what it promises. 

Developers, fix all these problems if you like, but the trust I had in your product, built up over many years, has gone.

Oh, and for that awful pink bubble, my retinas will never forgive you!

I've used this app for ever and now uninstalled it after this horrific update.  It no longer quietly works in the background but has a continual PURPLE list along the right hand side of the screen, listing all the trackers that are blocked, and which continually fills in and shifts and piles up with every page you load or as you sit and browse. This not only blocks the entire side of each page but also PRINTS if you print anything.  There's no way to take this off the page unless you manually move your hand/cursor/mouse and "X" it down after which it pops right back up and is now part of your page/screen/Life. Since Google analytics is on every page, let alone 20-50 blocked trackers you will have this giant purple list on every page, always (I had over 100 on one site and have at times 8 tabs open if not 3 browsers) Ghostery is an intrusive mess of epic proportions now. There's no fast, temporary way to suspend the app like there used to be if you're on your banking site or somewhere they need to give you a Cookie, or you find you have to let them see who you are for that moment or are having a problem signing in on some shopping site and figure you'll just turn off your adblocker and Ghostery for a second and see if that's the issue (and it usually is).  This whole app has changed and is no longer usable, user friendly or QUIET.  It makes the whole comp jerky, makes websites lag and Chrome is running with so much RAM being used (yes, I tested it with and without..it IS Ghostery causing it) that it was just simpler (and sad) to get rid of it.  We also had to uninstall it at my office because we're trying to conference call and Skype and we have this GIANT PURPLE LIST popping up while we're showing each other stuff on the web we're researching.  It's now impossible to take screen shot because Ghostery is in the way of trying to browse and use your computer.  But hey! Why shouldn't they own you like every other app thinks they do out there?  Wrong. Ghostery --  Get it together and put the old version up again until you put out a better update.
-------------------------
block
I used this extensions for years and it always delivered, what it promised, like noticeable faster loading webpages, blocked trackers and much more, though it broke some webpages. But version 7 ruined it, it actually slows down browsing now and heavily scripted GUI with huge font makes it totally unpractical. Basically, it has been discontinued, RIP Ghostery.
-------------------------
block
Hate the new update. I printed few things and every page has ghostery's circle of number of trackers blocked. 

I really wished ghostery remained the same and not get any NEW update. Alas it did. Good bye ghostery you were amazing...
-------------------------
block
Works with Adblock Plus seamlessly, no slowdowns or issuses.  

That was before...the new update only blocks http and https pages, no others.  The interface is ugly, and I'm just getting started.  Can I re-install the old version?
-------------------------
block
Not a fan of the recent update. While it works for me (unlike for some people, it seems), they've removed options that previously existed, including the ability to hide an annoying badge count that shows how many trackers have been blocked on a website. Badge counts are one of the first features I turn OFF on any extension that has them. They are distracting to the eye and pointless. 

I emailed Ghostery about this, asking if I was just missing where to turn this off now, and received this reply: "The badger [sic] counter is a non removable feature in Ghostery 7." No apologies, no promises for change, just a middle finger. 

You know what isn't "non-removable"? Ghostery.
-------------------------
block
It's a great extension, but... 

I was hoping that with the addition to the login option that my blocking settings would be saved. I use local computers often and it's a pain to have to whitelist sites I trust and unblock widgets and what not. It wastes time and time is money.

Update 9.8.16
Changing to one star, how do I revert back this update, cant do anything

I discovered this tool working on web performance projects, and now I tell everyone I meet to download and use it immediately, not for privacy concerns, but mainly for making the web 30% faster. For the major enterprise websites I look at, the combined third party analytics tracking pixels and calls contributes to 30% of the end to end download time in browser sessions. Given this realization, I wouldnt be surprised if the analytics industry is fighting tooth and nail to prevent a plugin like this from becoming a default feature of newer browser updates. Get ready for popups on your favorite site saying "please disable blocking tools to access our content"
-------------------------
block
Might just drop this in favor of uBlock Origin.  The new update is hideous and is as intrusive as what is supposed to be blocked.    Massive alert popup is both idiotic and fugly.   

The prompting to create an account is disturbing as well.   I suspect this is not going to end well.
-------------------------
block
Just Block It!
-------------------------
block
Forgot it was running, love that it keeps out junk trackers. Be sure to edit the settings to turn off its tracking and turn on blocking of trackers.
-------------------------
block
I understood tracking apps, but I did not how many there are and how they are all used. The list allowed me to research the companies as well as the tracker characteristics and determine which to block.
-------------------------
block
This is a Ghostman and no one can defeat this, because it's invisible from their eyes! It blocks all of those junk analytical, advertisement tools which we don't need! And ofcourse increase the speed.
-------------------------
block
fantastic... 5/5

Similar to being impressed by the amount of dirt and crud one might pull out of their vacuum, I was surprised to see how many intrusions Ghostery helps to block. 

More than a year since I started using it, I have barely noticed it running. Basically transparent user experience with some unexpected benefits - sometimes a commercial being served will be silent or a dark screen. I would never go back.
-------------------------
block
Did you turn off Ghostery  tracking and turn on all blocking of trackers in the setting options? Right click on icon, open options, uncheck if you don't want Ghostery to track trackers, also be sure to select all the tracker you want it to block.
-------------------------
block
Used this in another browser and got very used to it just blocking all the crap. Thanks!

detect
Im not sure whats going on, a couple of days ago it stopped working with FB and Youtube. At the same time I had been having a problem with DNS server, when I changed my DNS FB and youtube started working again but it no longer detects any trackers or beacons for FB  like it did before, why is this?
-------------------------
block
Latest version blocks Google Hangouts, Facebook and Youtube in chrome... Disabled until the next update.
-------------------------
block
Ghostery has been working fine up until a few days ago. I have to disable it to access Youtube and Facebook otherwise I just get an annoying  messed up HTML page. If the devs could fix this I'd really appreciate it.

I replied to a comment below that to fix the issue you had to remove the Ghostery then install it again. I'd like to clarify that this doesn't work for long, its still messing up Facebook and Youtube (and prob other sites I don't know about).

The only option you have is to either pause blocking or whitelist the websites. Which kind of defeats the purpose of this extension.
-------------------------
prevent
I identified this app as the one preventing my facebook, messenger and youtube sites from loading in the correct format (they were just displaying text). Until and Update comes out I will not be using the extension.
-------------------------
block
Way too often it blocks too much preventing access to basic sites. However, it is very easy to adjust and change what it blocks either in settings or on the page to unblock components required to view it.
-------------------------
block
Fantastic tracking blocker. I keep trying the FOSS alternatives -- Privacy Badger and Disconnect -- but Ghostery is just so much smoother and doesn't block nice things that I actually want. Thanks!
-------------------------
block
It's okay. It blocks too much and then the website does not function as it should. I still keep it on and when a site does not work I pause it, then I turn it back on the minute I leave the site.
-------------------------
block
I don't knpw why others do not use this..it's great for blocking.. when I'm on other computers all the popups and ads are soo annoying.. Love Ghostery!

IT SEEMS THAT FOR ALL OF YOU HAVING THIS THING, UBLOCK, THAT IT'S A "REDIRECTING" BROWSER TAKEOVER MALWARE?   I'VE HAD BEFORE, WITH CHROME SEEMING SUSCEPTIBLE  TO THESE,  AND THE ONLY GREAT REMOVAL TOOL,  "FREE"  LIKE GHOSTERY,  IS THE FABULOUS 
'ADWARE CLEANER",   COMBINED WITH MALWARE BYTES,  FREE AS WELL
FOR A TIME,  AS IS THE FABULOUS,  ADBLOCK CLEANER,  FOR AD BLOCKING,  YET  THE ONLY THING,  NOT WINDOWS, MCAFEE, CHROME, NORTON,  NOTHING,  THAT  WARNED ME OF  THESE COMPLETE TAKEOVER MALWARE  BROWSERS,  AND WORSE.    HAVING MY BRAND NEW LENOVO DESKTOP FOR 3 DAYS,   SEEMING TO WORK FINE BUT WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO LOAD  MY MCAFEE ANTI-VIRUS/TROJAN,   MALWARE, PROGRAM.
EVEN AS THE INCOMPETENT,  LAZY,  SUPPOSED TECH EXPERT AT COX COMMUNICATIONS,   MY CABLE TV, INTERNET PROVIDER  THAT COMES WITH MCAFEE,  SO PATRONIZINGLY,  UNABLE TO LOAD THIS HERSELF,  WITH MY HAVING TOLD HER THAT MAYBE WAS MALWARE PREVENTING THIS,  DIDN'T RUN A SINGLE MALWARE SCAN,  HAVING ASSURED ME THAT SHE PER THEIR  ASSURANCE PROGRAM,  WOULD HAVE IT LOADED IN 72 HOURS, THEN CALL ME BACK.

AS  I NEVER HEARD FROM HER,  CALLED, LEFT MESSAGES,  EVEN HEARING HER LAUGHING IN THE BACKGROUND.   YET LO AND BEHOLD,  MCAFEE  WAS WORKING,  SO I THOUGHT, ON THE FOURTH DAY!    AS I STILL AWAITED  HER CALL BACK TO GIVE ME THE FINAL PASSWORD SHE HAD USED  TO SET THIS UP.    MCAFEE  WAS RUNNING  THE REAL TIME SCANNING,   ALL MY SETTINGS, ALERT  NOTIFICATIONS  WERE SET TO MAX SAFETY,   WHERE IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,  THE FIREWALL IS TURNED OFF TO ALLOW A NEW PROGRAM THROUGH, WHATEVER, THEY SENT US INCESSANT POP UPS SAYING OUR SYSTEM ISN'T PROTECTED.  I EVEN  RAN A DEEP SCAN OVERNIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING  WAS LURKING ON THIS NEW COMPUTER,  OVERNIGHT,  THAN CAME OUT CLEAN.  THOUGH I STRANGELY HAD A 5 SECOND POP UP FROM LENOVO, CUT OFF,  JUST AS I WAS UNABLE TO LOAD MY NEW OFFICE PROGRAM!  TO BE SURE,  I RAN ANOTHER DEEP SCAN,  THOUGH OTHERWISE,  AL  LOOKED  FINE.  STILL NEVER HEARING FROM "C",  CALLING HER TO AGAIN HEAR HER LAUGHING  FROM  THE TECH POOL IT SEEMED.   BUT DAY 3, POST ANOTHE NORMAL DEEP SCAN BY MCAFEE,  I HAD THOUSANDS OF AD POP UPS COVERING THE SCREEN, UNABLE TO GET TO ANY PROGRAM,  OR MCAFEE,  AND  NOT A WARNING FROM ANY OF THESE SUPPOSED  SECURITY EXPERTS,  WINDOWS, CHROM, MCAFEE,  OF ANYTHING TRYING TO INVADE MY SYSTEM, CHANGE PROGRAMS.  BUT FOR BLESS  THEM, I RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE,  ANOTHER FREE MUST HAVE LIKE GHOSTERY,  ADBLOCK PLUS,  A  COLABORATOR WITH THE FREE MALWARE BYTES,  ADWARE CLEANER,  THE BEST SECURITY,  MALWARE CLEANERS THERE ARE.  I GOT HUNDREDS OF POP UPS IN BETWEEN  THESE OTHERS,  FIGHTING THROUGH  THEM,  WITH NOTICE POP UPS FROM THE ALSO FANTASTIC, MAX REISSLER, ON GOOGLE PLUS,  ANOTHER NO CHARGE, MALWARE EXPERT, RESEARCHER,  TELLING ME THAT MY BROWSER WAS TAKEN OVER BY A TROJAN AS WELL!!
SOMEHOW I UNINSTALLED ONE OF THESE MALWARE, AD PRODUCERS, 'SIGNAL STRONG', JUST LONG ENOUGH TO CHECK MY SYSTEM, SHOCKED TO SEE THAT WINDOWS EVERYTHING HAD BEEN UNINSTALLED, BY A NEW "USER",  NAMED 'GROWSMART"M,  THAT REINSTALLED IT'S OWN  SO  EXACT VERSIONS OF WINDOWS, CHROME, EVEN OF MCAFEE  SUPPOSEDLY RUNNING  REAL TIME AND DEEP SCANS!  I WOULD NEVER HAD KNOWN  IF NOT FOR ADBLOCK PLUS,  MAX REISLER OF ADWARE CLEANER, FOR FREE, SENDING ME THE NONSTOP POP UPS  TELLING ME  OF  THIS  NIGHTMARE

It's clean and simple but there are a LOT of popups, scripts and ads that are not blocked and it doesn't have the functionality to add custom or external filters. Some non-intrusive ads on facebook and yahoo appear to be whitelisted. I'm also very suspicios of the high ratings here, there are many better and non-proprietary extensions available.

Really helpful lets me know whos tracking me and block them very simple too highly recomended for someone who wants just to browse a little more comfortably

This is for more than just the paranoid. It helps protect your privacy, which is a reasonable thing to expect. I set it to block everything by default, and only enable something in specific cases (like chat boxes) on sites when it is my choice.
-------------------------
block
It works OK but it still blocks Streak in Gmail even when mail.google.com is whitelisted! Whitelisting is NOT WORKING WELL!!!!

I have used other AD blocking software, like Ad Blocker & AD
Blocker Plus, Privacy Badger and the like. Don't get me wrong, they all worked good but
none of them blocked as many or had all the features that 
GHOSTERY DOES!

Ghostry blocks so many ads, pop-ups and unwanted scripts that load in background that now it saves huge amount of bandwidth. Mostly when am on youtube, the autoplay of ads before you can skip it to actual video is saving almost 8-10GB of bandwidth every month! Kudos to Ghostery team
-------------------------
block
works great for me.

You can disable the display of the blocked content.

One has to disable the send-data-to-ghostery if one doesn't like it
-------------------------
block
Effective way to block trackers. The only problem is that it blocks its own website (trackermap thing).
-------------------------
block
Brilliant app! Doesn't affect the speed of the Chrome Browser and identifies and blocks tracking and targeting by third (or fourth) party agents. This should be a standard feature built into Chrome!
-------------------------
block
Really a nice tracker blocker, easy to install and then Ghostery takes care of the rest. BUT, Google has found a way to block Ghostery. Same www. pages på Firefox will include many blocked sites but not on Google.
-------------------------
block
The app works well, but its intentions are questionable. Ghostery is funded by advertisers so its odd that they would help support such an app. 

Personally I think advertisers use the behavioral data from ghostery so they can find out what other methods they can use to feed you ads or better track your behavior. They can see how users are blocking data or what they block to sidetrack or reinvent the wheel. Be wary there are other options not tied to advertisers like disconect
-------------------------
block
It actually makes my browser faster by blocking the trackers!
-------------------------
block
I've been using it for years now, but oddly enough didn't decide to comment until now lol... I would rate 5 stars, but for some sites, even putting it on pause, or turning it off still doesn't allow some legit sites to load. Bottomline when used with an ad blocking extension it gives us an extra layer of protection but with the ad blocker and Ghostery running at the same time even on a 64b browser it can slow loading time of pages by up to 15 seconds of staring at a blank white page while it loads.
-------------------------
block
Ghostery gives the illusion of protecting your privacy. While it does block trackers, it is misleading because it sends info to the trackers anyway. PrismBreak has listed this addon as dangerous.
-------------------------
block
I've used many of the search engines apps for blocking 3rd party cookies, inline frames and rogue JS's. Ghostery still gets me wet.
-------------------------
block
Very easy to configure. It's shocking to see how many times we are tracked on so many websites so I am a little sceptical. How would we know? Just because it says, 10 trackers blocked. Have they actually been blocked? It's not as if we get a 'Who's been tracking you this month!' list delivered to us once a month.  So I've set it to block 100% of trackers found and will update this at the start of each browsing session on the presumption that, if this extension truly is preventing our browsing habits from being tracked, the 150-200+ junk emails I receive on a daily basis should decrease dramatically
-------------------------
block
I was a skeptic up until the point where I loaded the app and went to my usual sites, I couldn't believe how many things were tracking me and how easy it was to stop them and reload the page with the peace of mind knowing that this Chrome Extension had blocked them. I have one slight issue, it seems to forget my selections after a reboot, but apparently that isn't a general issue.
-------------------------
block
I like the idea that I can see who's tracking me, and block them instantly.
-------------------------
block
I feel very well protected from unwanted spying and add ons by uninvited adware and spyware when I see that Ghostery is blocking all that they know are threats.
-------------------------
block
it blocks photos out of articles and doesnt show full page content, stupid app
-------------------------
block
Easy to use even if you're not too techie.  Blocks a lot of stuff, its pretty amazing all the tracking that's happening, and a little scary.  I don't think that I've got that much to hide, but the idea of businesses collecting all kind of info on me, isn't something that I want to participate in.  Maybe I'm paranoid, but I have to wonder if some of the tracking information could be abused in the wrong hands to possibly make identity theft easier.  Hope not, but just in case, another reason to be leary of the trackers.
-------------------------
block
For effortlessly blocking Trackers, Beacons & other unnecessary bits Ghostery deserves auditioning.

To install?
Not to install??

Try it and KNOW if it can help. Like me, you just might keep it.

Blocks ads adblocker couldn't. Especially on Youtube.

Great app for blocking all the annoying advertisement
-------------------------
block
I was wondering how Ghostery Inc. profited from a free extension so I looked up the company on Wikipedia. It's a double edged sword; on one hand it keeps your activities from being tracked on the other it collects data of what is blocked and sells that data to ad agencies so they can better understand what people prefer to block and not block.
-------------------------
block
Works OK, but no custom URL blocking, and no way to submit URLs to the developers for analysis? Come on, peeps.
-------------------------

Most amazing extension I have seen so far on chrome. I went on a site that had a small Facebook button. I clicked on my new Ghostery extension and blocked the Facebook tracking. I then reloaded, and looked at the Facebook button again. A little Ghost figure rested over top of the button with a little X-out sign next to it. This is only more proof that this works and is effective. I have other ad tracking viewers and when I disable the tracking site on this app the site on the other app disappears. GET THIS NOW.

Blocked too many pages. Had to manually turn it on and off multiple times a day.

Great extension which has certainly improved over the years. Upgraded my review from 3 to 5 stars.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: It's a helpful Extension, however it doesn't seem to block all the trackers every time and I often see the box show multiple ones left uncrossed. Please fix this because I added Ghostery to block ALL the trackers, not just some of them.
-------------------------

It's okay to keep track of the spying programs, but it's a drag to keep interrupting your work to have to block manually and pick up those you need.

Awesome.

Will be better if we can specify rules for different domains and stuffs to block. I was looking for a solution to block Google Analytics on my own site to avoid recording my own visits and this looks more than what I wanted...
-------------------------
block
I had to uninstall Ghostery after looking it up and finding on the internet that it absolutely does sell, and in some cases outright gives your tracking information to these companies they claim to block?
Also look at the post from July 11, 2014

Ghostery just found itself and blocked itself on a site.. Surprised I searched around and found out that ghostery is kinda helping the ad-industry.. W-T-* bro?
-------------------------
block
I literally could not use the internet while this was running.  I thought something was wrong with my internet connection until I finally "paused" Ghostery and everything started working properly again.  Websites took FOREVER to load, Netflix included! Maybe I selected too many trackers to block, but not worth the headache it caused!
-------------------------
block
Sells data on the ads you block to the ad companies themselves.
-------------------------

Awesome. Does it also block lso cookies? I havent found anything about it in the settings. But maybe thats another thing...

Fantastic. Can sometimes mess up forms or online transactions so don't be scared of whitelisting sites or pausing the blocking if something isn't working right.

I highly recommend Ghostery. I'm a tad OCD and I researched and tried a lot of privacy extensions like NoScript, DoNotTrackMe and Disconnect before deciding that my fave was Ghostery. If you feel annoyed about all the companies and even stats-obsessed bloggers aggressively tracking you, this is a must-have extension (and if you're not that concerned about your privacy, your loss bc a tracker+cookie can reveal A LOT about you). Subscribing to EasyPrivacy List or Fanboy Annoyances/Social List through ABP is not enough. You need an extension to be able to block everything and control what you block. Ghostie blocks pretty much everything for me (though I feel like it works even better in Firefox) and I can allow certain widgets I use frequently, like disqus and soundcloud, and whitelist certain sites I trust. I would recommend you turn off the alert bubble and choose "block new elements by default". If Ghostery blocks too much stuff for you, just toggle off blocking on widgets. Overall, great, easy-to-use extension.
-------------------------
block
It blocks all trackers I know and more!
-------------------------
block
I kept getting the "waiting for cache" bug, found out it was AdBlock Plus, but didn't want to run with ads. Ghostery blocks with the best of em and doesn't cause "waiting for cache" lag!
-------------------------
block
The best, easy to setup, fast, also available for Opera and Firefox. Very long list of sites being blocked.
-------------------------
block
I love the idea, but this is not the tool for me. It slowed by browser down and made me take extra steps to view content on too many websites. I basically ended up pausing blocking or whitelisting too made sites just to be able to see the content that this hid. Missing content included reviews on some sites, pictures or products on some sites (Nordstrom) and video from many sites. I am unintalling the program.
-------------------------
block
Can even block advertisement (like abp) but (still) isn't detected by the websites. A must, along with ABP
-------------------------
block
Best for blocking trackers and other annoying stuff.
-------------------------
block
Ghostery > Disconnect. If you do a side-by-side comparison, you'll notice that Ghostery blocks more stuff than Disconnect. Seriously! Right down to the point where you can go down blocking share buttons! Of course, it makes webpages load 1 second slower than Disconnect. But I prefer privacy, over speed. Hopefully, in the future though, Ghostery will be just as fast as Disconnect.

It secretly tracks you just the same as the trackers it blocks.

prevent
I can't say enough about this addon. Wish I had installed it ages ago. I've noticed a huge improvement with no interference to the speed of things. Other than a few instances where I couldn't figure out which tracker was preventing videos/online tools to work, I have no complaints.

Bye Bye trackers. You are BLOCKED! Thanks to the next big thing, Ghostery!

First rate monitoring and blocking extension. Use this everywhere.
-------------------------
block
It's funny someone makes a script to block trackers but yet logs everything you do. There are many reports of Ghostery selling it to third party companies. Get real people your destroying the sites you love using this addon or ABP!
-------------------------
block
I love how people are so afraid of their privacy. Most of these scripts they block are scripts to help webmaster better serve you. Then they get mad when all the stuff doesn't work when they visit a site since Ghostery disabled something on it they cry and send emails. Well your using a addon that blocks certain functions of a site. If your so afraid get off the internet. I can't wait to start a website that starts blocking these types of addons. Also your hurt websites when you block advertisements though even you don't click on them they still get add impressions. If you choose to block advertisements don't use sites that are supported by ads so you get used to them no being there!
-------------------------
block
web condom to block all
-------------------------
block
Ghostery for Firefox is much better.  In Firefox, when I press the Ghostery icon, Ghostery tells you whether the tracker is advertising, tracker or widget (though it doesn't group them).  When you press the Ghostery icon in Chrome, it lists all the trackers (grouped by company) without specifying whether it's advertising, widgets or a tracker.  I've been blocking most trackers and advertising in Firefox.  If you can do this in the Chrome Ghostery, it isn't very intuitive.  I still like it though.
-------------------------
block
Must have web condom to block all kinds of nasty JavaScript crap
-------------------------

Great blocking app, catching more trackers than "do not track me" did. BUT it REALLY slows down Chrome, particularly it seems after the browser has been open for a few hours.

I know the slowdown is due to Ghostery because a message appears at the bottom of the browser saying it's waiting for Ghostery. :-(  Very frustrating.
-------------------------
block
This is one good app! Only one question ~ how does Ghostery use the tracking data that it blocks??
-------------------------
block
Biggest improvement to the browsing experience since AdBlock. Blocks all kinds of spammy things I don't care about.
-------------------------
prevent
I absolutely love Ghostery! "Do Not Track" simply does not do as much as this app in preventing tracking activity.
-------------------------
block
Great, except for one (browser related) problem: Ghostery for Chrome doesn't block as much as Firefox (cookies etc.), but this is because Chrome doesn't have the appropriate APIs. If you want more control (and less speed), use Firefox.
-------------------------
block
Great app, and I love the fine-grained control over which type of trackers it blocks. I especially like that it shows you what specifically it blocks, but it always bugged me that the shortest time you could set the popup to display for is 3 seconds. 

If anyone else is having the same problem, you can fix this by going into the options page for the extension, clicking "Inspect HTML element" over the dropdown where you choose the time to display for, right-clicking the highlighted HTML element in the source editor and selecting "Edit HTML", replacing the number with your desired time, and hitting "Save Options" at the bottom of the page. Presto! As much control over the display time as you want!
-------------------------
block
Ghostery is a great program to have. wish it would give more info or be easier to block sites with it. However, I understand it is very hard task to tackle.
-------------------------
protect
This is a must for real privacy if you are willing to spend some time refining it a little as you browse so the sites you need to work (and which sacrifice your privacy) are given some leeway. With this, you decide who, where, when, and why any site (or any snooping corporation) gets access to data on your system or gets to track you everywhere you go.

Do not trust that your browser alone can protect you, especially if you are using Chrome, Safari, or IE. Get this now and then add HTTPS Everywhere as well.
-------------------------

Has suddenly started blocking pretty much EVERYTHING without asking. I try to delete it, but every time I restart Chrome it's back.

very usefull, dosent auto block unless you want it to, so you can see who is tracking you, not just block them outright.
-------------------------
block
It would be nice if the descriptions also listed the sites that the tracker came from and those it is going to affect if blocked. In addition it would be nice if there were a place to type in a site you are having trouble with to see if it has been reported to cause a problem and what one should unblock to use it.In a perfect world if a block were to cause a problem,a pop-up would tell us what we would need to unblock in order to use.Thank-you an eye-opener.

Takes tweaking if you want to enjoy a full compliment of websites without disturbing their functionality. For instance, this app, when blocking all trackers, sometimes makes my Google surfing rough. To be more specific, I have found it necessary to turn the Ghostery blocking options "on" or "off" based on the visited website demands. It keeps pics from loading on some sites, keeps forms from working, and so forth. This isn't ghosterys' fault, and they must have seen it coming because they have a built-in workaround in the shape of editing preferences for each site. Very helpful extension, IMHO.

This is a great extension to block all those snoopy trackers!
-------------------------
block
This little bitty extension in my Chrome browser has done exactly what I had hoped it would do. If I could rate it higher than 5 stars I would. It has shown me exactly how my browsing is being tracked, it blocks the sites I choose while allowing access to the sites I want.
-------------------------
block
Recommended - everyone should be using this. Block everything then unblock specific trackers or sites as you prefer.
-------------------------
block
While it's a useful plugin, it could make it easier to extract the URLs or domains to permit easier adding into Adblock. At the moment I can select the domain in the drop-down from the icon, press ctrl-c then manually add a filter into adblock. Ideally Ghostery would permit blocking of individual web-bugs and permit editing of the blocked URLs.
-------------------------

I love it, but wish I had the ability to just block the advertising bugs like I can in the Firefox version.
-------------------------
detect
This is the best way to detect 3rd parties and hidden items performing tracking on a web site.

The only thing I don't like about it is that it cannot currently tell the difference between opt-out cookies and id cookies.  

This would be a nice feature, and it would be even nicer if it could "lock in" opt-out cookies and detect when a company does not obey their opt out cookie and  allow you to notify the company (in case it is a rouge affiliate) and the service boards they belong to.
-------------------------

I'd like the blocking lists separated into categories like Firefox. I don't need to block ads because I already have Adblock Plus.
-------------------------

Useful for debugging code and for checking third party and advert links on all sites.

I don't use it for blocking anything, just for monitoring.
-------------------------
block
like a more limited version of noscript that  only blocks web garbage
-------------------------
block
Hope specific cookie blocking will come soon (like it is on firefox).
-------------------------
block
Great plugin! Getting rid of all those nasty social plugins that are trying to collect data without an opt-out possibility. 

Some sites may have broken functionality, and sometimes you need something that Ghostery blocks, it would be nice if Ghostery had an option to temporarily allow one or more bugs to run.

Also, but this is more of a Chrome problem, it doesn't block as much as Ghostery for Firefox does. I hope Chrome will offer a decent blocking API in the future.

Ghostery is one of my favorite Chrome extension. It is constantly blocking all the soliciting and tracking that every website has now. I get satisfaction knowing that I'm blocking some websites from tracking my every move.

I suggested this to all my friends and family. You should try it yourself to see if you like it.

Two problems: 1. In trying to figure out why my basic Ghostery account has suddenly stopped blocking ads and trackers on Chrome over the last week or so, I visited your site for information. 2. There seems to be a problem with my email address. I can't sign in, yet your system says my email is already in use.

Is there any way you can code Ghostery so that it can fool sites that can detect ad blockers? It is a pain when a video does not load up, or when I get a window asking to turn off the blocker for that site. Cheers Jim Holtz jimnholtz@gmail.com

I see that the ghost is gray, which means that ads are not being blocked but the extension window will not show up when clicked. Also, all options on the website are not working.

I've detected that Chrome's Task Manager shows that Ghostery extension consumes 2GB of memory. I guess it's not normal behavior. I'm using a lot of tabs and doesn't restart Chrome at least several days. So, now Google Chrome consumes 4.3GB of memory and 1.94GB taken by Ghostery.

Hi, there is no option to manually ad things to block at this time. However, please feel free to utilize our submit a tracker feature if you come across anything you would like to see us add to our database. You can do this by: open the Ghostery menu > click the three stacked dots at the top > click "submit a tracker" > submit any applicable information you have! Thanks!

The latest version of this extension seems to leak memory and allocates up to 12G of virtual memory (Chrome Linux). This memory seems to be mostly unused, just allocated. It still affects system performance. I needed to disable it. I'm currently looking for a different solution instead of Ghostery. It was once great but blocking has become intransparent (no clear overview of what is blocked and what isn't) and messes with some of the new GDPR cookie guidelines (preferences are always forgotten, I have to accept cookies each visit again).

Ghostery now prevents reCaptcha to load. This makes it impossible to access certain parts of websites and prevents sending messages that require a reCaptcha confirmation.

Out of the blue, when I try to attach a file to an email I'm sending, it will NOT open the page so I can open the file I want to attach. If I "pause" Ghostery, then all works like it used to, but then all kinds of junk has not been blocked. What happened? I have to deactivate Ghostery or leave Chrome and to to Explorer (blah).

Would like to report an issue with the current version of Ghostery for Chrome where Ghostery causes Chrome's pop-up blocker to block all links opened in a new tab using middle click. Disabling Ghostery resolves the issue. This only started with a recent update to Ghostery. Using: Ghostery v8.2.6 and Chrome 71.0.3578.98 (Official Build) (64-bit) on Windows 7. There are multiple reports of this issue.

I have Ghostery running and have for a long time. Recently, just about everything that opens in a new tab gets blocked by Chrome as a pop up.

I am running Chrome Version 70.0.3538.77 and have had Ghostery running in the background for about the last 12 months with no issues. With the latest Chrome update the talktalk webmail page split in two with the emails displayed at the top and then all the menu commands displayed underneath as if it where on two seperate screens. Talktalk admitted there was an issue with this build of Chrome but said they had fixed it from their end. The only way I could clear the fault on my computer was by turning the TalkTalk Webmail page into a trusted site and so turn off your protection. I hope the information is useful to you in continuing to develop the app.

Sometimes ghostery blocks me from a site that I WANT to go to - and doesn't give me a link to get around it. How do I disable ghostery temporarily, or for a particular site?

Recently, I have been finding more and more sites not working because the captcha widget isn't loading. It's not obvious which service to unblock for this, and I have found sites where Ghostery doesn't show anything being blocked (though I think it showed 1 being blocked by count, but nothing on the right side of the dialog). I would either like captcha to be not blocked, or at least some way to know what to unblock.

I hope the error code I pasted in above may be able to help you fix the problem , if it is in fact your problem. Jet Black Australian internet user since 1994.

Ghostery blocks some players by default these are described as widgets - use the setting in ghostery to enable some of the 'widgets' on the page and reload - the pages own player should play - it is really important to go through ghosterys settings and really get to grips with them.

No one has commented here since 2019 and its 2022 so I will say this in 2022 this app has become annoying with popups that try and force feed you "updates" that are frankly worse rather than better and after the update and it working EVEN WORSE YET AGAIN not blocking the ads but LETTING THEM THROUGH on sites such as "watchseries" where it was once the go to app for blocking trackers and ads you are better off seeking alternitives today the company is more concerned with letting trackers buy there way in than keeping them out of my web browsing experience sadly
-------------------------
popup
Works just as intended. Sometimes it'll block something that's a pop-up but not a malicious one, like the smaller pop-up Google Translate on websites in other languages. But you can click a button where it'll tell you that it blocked the pop-up and to simply click there to allow it if you're looking for a fix. Also one of the only extensions I've found that offer Anti-Tracking, Ad-Blocking, and a Smart Blocking option all for free! Would recommend.

Too many pop-ups.  Yes, you can turn them off in the settings, though the option to permanently disable should also be given in the pop-ups themselves for ease / user experience.  Leaving this review to make the point.

This extension really loves telling you about itself and is really annoying. I hate notifications, pop-ups and attempts to sell which is why I want to use this type of tool in the first place.

It is now serving popup advertising itself. Not feature updates, or notifications but Popup Advertising for unrelated Ghostery business ventures. Leads me to have 0 trust in this extension now as it is functionally an advertising server.
-------------------------
popup
Highly ineffective and getting worse every day... almost every site I go to now has a pop-up saying I should disable this plugin... So I don't get the ads, but I don't get the site either...  6 months ago I would have given this a 4.  The internet has advanced, but Ghostery hasn't.
-------------------------
popup
I like the protection the extension offers and I am pleased with most of the operation and settings.  The one thing I would really like to turn off is the popup in the lower right corner of each page.  I am sure that several people like this, but I find it annoying.  I would prefer the application just works instead of notifying me every time I load a page, follow a link to a new page on the same site or just researching something through hundreds of pages.  I checked the extension settings and I did not find a way to turn this off.  Closing it only makes things worse as I have to interact with it and it just comes back on the next page or new tab.  I would rather a popup only if there is a problem.

A recent update made it so whenever I open Chrome, Ghostery ALWAYS warns me that they updated the app and have new features. I close the popup but whenever I restart Chrome it always shows up with the same message. It used to only do this once after an update before

Feature-packed, but with many deal-breaking issues, such as treating middle mouse clicks as opening a popup window, thus blocking it - even when the plugin is paused, or blocking uploads on some software like Octoprint.

Suddenly Uploads are being blocked. Disabled every extension, one at at time, it was Ghostery. Always worked flawlessly before, January 2019 it started blocking BUFFER app (Social Media Scheduling) and Tweetdeck (Twitter) from uploading images. There was nothing in the settings to alter, tried reset of Chrome, which worked until Ghostery started, then uploading was being blocked again from my own computer.  (PC)  Chrome, AVG, and Malwarebytes were running and unaffected. All other sources including Windows Defender were not the problem. Cannot use it until that problem gets addressed. Turned it off 4 minutes ago and suffering serious withdrawals and popups ;)

Your latest update just broke Chrome. Popups of any kind will break, and believe it or not, quite a few websites rely on it. Youtube Fullscreen doesn't work, image uploading doesn't work, logins don't work.

I'm done. But I will give you my Chrome version in case you actually fix this: Version 71.0.3578.80 (Official Build) (64-bit)

Ghostery was one of my top favorite apps, but no more...  I feel betrayed on a deep level by Ghostery... For about a month now, another one of my pop up blocker has been going crazy asking if I want to block a popup, just by clicking on nothingness on sites, even my own college sites at them, and when allowed I got taken to a random ad site.... I thought it was malware at first cause it was effecting .org sites even.... Then I accused the very pop up blocker warning me, but when I turned it off, I was suddenly sent to these ad sites automatically with no defence.... Luckily I only had a few extensions and after trail and error, I was left in disbelief at Ghostery, turned it off, and the problem's gone.... Ghostery, an extension designed to help you, has turned into an internal ad program... I feel betrayed and depart with a goodbye.

Current update problem
1. middle click not working -> built-in popup blocker appear and ask to change the setting to allow it
2. youtube full screen not working
-------------------------
popup
As of 28/11/2018 Ghostery prevents middle button clicks and Ctrl/Command + Click from opening new pages, with no option to adjust the behavior.

This is extremely annoying.

This somehow feeds into the built-in popup blocker. When Ghostery is disabled, the clicks function as they should.

Everything was okay until today, for some reason clickable areas are different to visible items in extension popup. For example, to highlight the second menu item, cursor should be placed a little to the top and left from it

Update 9.8.16
Changing to one star, how do I revert back this update, cant do anything

I discovered this tool working on web performance projects, and now I tell everyone I meet to download and use it immediately, not for privacy concerns, but mainly for making the web 30% faster. For the major enterprise websites I look at, the combined third party analytics tracking pixels and calls contributes to 30% of the end to end download time in browser sessions. Given this realization, I wouldnt be surprised if the analytics industry is fighting tooth and nail to prevent a plugin like this from becoming a default feature of newer browser updates. Get ready for popups on your favorite site saying "please disable blocking tools to access our content"
-------------------------

used to like it... before the horrible update

how to fix it?
... 
1 fix the option page... it doesn't show options anymore

4 give users choices like appearance 

oh also

Might just drop this in favor of uBlock Origin.  The new update is hideous and is as intrusive as what is supposed to be blocked.    Massive alert popup is both idiotic and fugly.   

The prompting to create an account is disturbing as well.   I suspect this is not going to end well.

I don't knpw why others do not use this..it's great for blocking.. when I'm on other computers all the popups and ads are soo annoying.. Love Ghostery!

It's clean and simple but there are a LOT of popups, scripts and ads that are not blocked and it doesn't have the functionality to add custom or external filters. Some non-intrusive ads on facebook and yahoo appear to be whitelisted. I'm also very suspicios of the high ratings here, there are many better and non-proprietary extensions available.
-------------------------

This extension places adware on your computer from right-coupon AKA: shoppers assistant.  It took me weeks to figure out that it was coming from this extension.  You will notice pop-ups and ads at nearly every website after installing this extension.

Ghostry blocks so many ads, pop-ups and unwanted scripts that load in background that now it saves huge amount of bandwidth. Mostly when am on youtube, the autoplay of ads before you can skip it to actual video is saving almost 8-10GB of bandwidth every month! Kudos to Ghostery team

Pop-up notification bubbles and the hard-headed dev who won't stop them

Ghostery is a good product that does what it claims it will do; and does it with aplomb.  And so I give it five stars for that, at least, since that's the most important thing.

However, there's also something about it that makes me furious; and I think anyone who's thinking of using Ghostery should know about it.  So here it is...

I keep writing to the dev and telling him to stop popping-up notification bubbles in the upper-right corner of my browser. He keep writing back and telling me how to go into settings and turn them off, which, of course, I do. I'm not stupid; I've been an IT pro for pushing 40 years and I'm pretty sure I know how to configure an app.

The problem is, and has always been, that the app, even after I've turned-off all pop-up notification bubbles, nevertheless still pops-up such bubbles at least to notify me of that the database has been updated; or that there's been some other kind of update.

I don't want to see those kinds of bubbles, either; and there seems no way to turn them off in the app's settings. And the dev seems to think it's okay to interrupt people's work in their browsers with such notifications.

Certain app developers just insist on their apps being the center of everything. They don't seem to get that their app is just one app of many on most people's computers, and all computer users just want their apps to work, and be quiet about it.

Devs of Chrome plugins/extensions who pop-open a whole new tab to announce that their app has just updated are the worst offenders, of course. Abine's DO-NOT-TRACK-ME did that yesterday, and nearly froze my browser right in the middle of my typing something that was on a deadline. I was so angry I almost screamed out loud.

What Ghostery does, with the pop-up bubble notifications of updates are almost as bad; and no amount of complaining about it, and describing it seems to get through the thick skull of its developer, who insists that as long as I've turned-off all notifications in the app's settings, then I shouldn't be seeing any bubbles.

One time one of said bubbles popped-up to tell me that Ghostery's database had updated literally while I was reading his email insisting that I must not have configured the app properly.

Ghostery's dev, then, is, in my opinion, an awful kind of intransigent bully who's incapable of taking the necessary giant step back from himself and his work to honestly ask himself if someone else could possibly be right.

Shame on him. Persons considering using Ghostery should make sure their eyes are wide open about the kind of person is its dev.

Would have gotten 5 stars if it would have had profiles (eg "allow facebook connect", "allow "disqus") and whitelisting a site towards those profiles.

Reason: Normally I do not want these trackers on but for some sites I always want them on. But just some selected trackers, hence not a whitelisting of the site... This results in a lot of enabling / disabling some trackers.  

The lack of this feature plus the lack of a "dismiss bubble button" in the bubble popup only gives it a 4. Otherwise it is a must have plug/extension.
-------------------------
popup
Great app, and I love the fine-grained control over which type of trackers it blocks. I especially like that it shows you what specifically it blocks, but it always bugged me that the shortest time you could set the popup to display for is 3 seconds. 

If anyone else is having the same problem, you can fix this by going into the options page for the extension, clicking "Inspect HTML element" over the dropdown where you choose the time to display for, right-clicking the highlighted HTML element in the source editor and selecting "Edit HTML", replacing the number with your desired time, and hitting "Save Options" at the bottom of the page. Presto! As much control over the display time as you want!
-------------------------
popup
It would be nice if the descriptions also listed the sites that the tracker came from and those it is going to affect if blocked. In addition it would be nice if there were a place to type in a site you are having trouble with to see if it has been reported to cause a problem and what one should unblock to use it.In a perfect world if a block were to cause a problem,a pop-up would tell us what we would need to unblock in order to use.Thank-you an eye-opener.

Has been excellent over the weeks that I've tried it. (popup time is configurable btw) However with the very latest versions of Chrome it seems to be slowing down browsing quite a bit. I'm sure that's solved soon.

Ghostery does what it claims, but implementation could be better.  The pop-ups are annoying and make no mention of being from Ghostery.  I wanted them to stop, but it took awhile to even figure out what was causing them.  Playing with my extension made me realize it was Ghostery, so I disabled it.

Whenever I do an "open in new tab" action, the Chrome pop-up blocker cancels the action. The only way to open new tabs is by right-clicking and clicking "Open link in new tab". This issue is caused by Ghostery, because disabling the Ghostery extension fixes the issue.

Would like to report an issue with the current version of Ghostery for Chrome where Ghostery causes Chrome's pop-up blocker to block all links opened in a new tab using middle click. Disabling Ghostery resolves the issue. This only started with a recent update to Ghostery. Using: Ghostery v8.2.6 and Chrome 71.0.3578.98 (Official Build) (64-bit) on Windows 7. There are multiple reports of this issue. Please see posts made on 2019-01-09 at https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=305351 - where users have commented that removing Ghostery resolves the issue.

When the "Tracker List Updated" popup appears and I click on "Whats new?", I am redirected to the settings page. All seems to work.

To my surprise I often see Ghostery recommended even though it's notorious for being anything but private. I decided to try recently anyway out of curiosity. It performs well-enough but a there is a rogue ad here and there, even Youtube ads on occasion begin loading (but the ad does not start). Given the fact Ghostery is harvesting your private data for profit it seems ridiculous to bother with it because free, open-source ad blockers like uBlock Origin and AdGuard perform even better. Ghostery is predatory too. At install it motioned me towards downloading a Ghostery spyware suite; including a 'free' VPN! A lot of people will fall prey and unknowingly lose their right to privacy. Way to go Ghostery!

Normally, for extra protection when surfing the web, a user might turn to incognito mode. But in incognito mode only ensures that your browsing history is not stored on your computer, but the data still trickles out to these third parties like google or facebook.

Used to be great, but recently has started to break continued authentication for some sites (Google, annoyingly, but also Medium), and can't keep itself logged in either, so all my whitelists that are supposed to benefit sites I don't mind ads on become useless. As the technical ability has gone down, things like Ghostery Rewards have gone up, and I find the downsides in getting sites working are not worth the upsides. Sorry Ghostery, long time user uninstalling.

Ghostery Review and experience in Chrome: Extension was okay but prevented some sites from loading. No problem: In this case I disabled the extension for a short while. Since a few months now, ghostery itself pushes ads to my screen - so called Ghostery Rewards.

They are anoying, take time to close and click away and never deliver value.
Deinstalled and will never reinstall.

First i have to put that Ghostery is one of the best "Ad SPAM Blocker" i have used.

I only use Ghostery on sites that bombard me with Ads that take more time to load Ads than the content i am looking for.

The main reason i am only give 4 stars out of 5 is because there use to be advance settings for adjusting which Ad to block or allow for Ghostery that were easy to use but now there is a watered down in setting that only allows me to use default or block.

And because i cannot customize these some sites are breaking, mostly on sites comments.

*Update* Few minutes after posting this, I sill wanted to mess with Ghostery and i was able to fix the comment issue. I tested it with a few sites and it is working for me. 

I had to disable the Enhanced Ad Blocking *Which is the shield button* and only in detailed display disable what I don't want to see.

So now 4 out of 5 until Enhanced Ad Blocking is improved.

Same issue here on youtube and other sites as well, can't get videos in fullscreen unless you also click the zoom/fullscreen in chrome or F11.  Such a pain!  Ghostery has worked great for years, so not sure if this is their fault or if chrome broke something ghostery uses.  Either way, though, the ghostery extension is broken.  I hope they get it fixed soon!

I've had it a year but recently its started causing problems. Pages hang for ages and fail to load. The message at the foot of the page says "Waiting for Ghostery.."

Your latest update just broke Chrome. Popups of any kind will break, and believe it or not, quite a few websites rely on it. Youtube Fullscreen doesn't work, image uploading doesn't work, logins don't work.

Ghostery was one of my top favorite apps, but no more...  I feel betrayed on a deep level by Ghostery... For about a month now, another one of my pop up blocker has been going crazy asking if I want to block a popup, just by clicking on nothingness on sites, even my own college sites at them, and when allowed I got taken to a random ad site.... I thought it was malware at first cause it was effecting .org sites even.... Then I accused the very pop up blocker warning me, but when I turned it off, I was suddenly sent to these ad sites automatically with no defence.... Luckily I only had a few extensions and after trail and error, I was left in disbelief at Ghostery, turned it off, and the problem's gone.... Ghostery, an extension designed to help you, has turned into an internal ad program... I feel betrayed and depart with a goodbye.

Should automatically add new cookies and other objects to the filter, instead you have to manually add them yourself.

They have a number of bugs that are breaking the ability to view high profile websites.

Now it just auto disables everything on update instead of forcing you to manually add new trackers. I get that it wants to allow websites to function but this is dishonest. I don't care if it's open source, your designing default behavior to be disingenuous and counter intuitive. Fix your product and stop making excuses about why you aren't communicating terrible functionality changes. That or stop making the terrible changes to begin with and you won't see as much backlash.

I've used Ghostery for years but will no longer.
The newest update, even when websites are marked trusted, ghostery would disable crucial javascript for uploading content via file explorer to any website.
An example is if you go to imgur and go to upload a file and click the browse button to what's supposed to open a file explorer window to all you to select the file(s) you wish to upload. After spending considerable time troubleshooting, I discovered the Ghostery extension was causing the Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT Console errors preventing the javascript opening a window to upload files. This mind you, was for ANY button on ANY website (I tested everything from major websites to edu websites). I mean.. I didn't have to once I discovered the issue was Ghostery but before that when troubleshooting I did. I will never use Ghostery again for Google Chrome... and with features Chrome has added you don't need to anymore.. so really neither should anyone else. Again, even with a website marked as trusted (which I doubled checked again with Ghostery re-installed) Ghostery still preventing this safe and normal javascripts from loading which enable the ability to upload files via a file browser window.

Am working in Digital Marketing, used this extension for almost 3 years, recently, it started to block the trackers automatically, and stop the platform from being loaded (especially Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform).

Hey Martin,

No Trackers are whitelisted. The Smart blocking feature is designed to fix the "page break" issue that many users complained about.. if the tracker takes longer than 3 seconds to load we unblock it so there is no page disruption. You can turn that off and no longer have that available, but there may be issues with the page functionality.

I'm going to agree with the large number of reviews indicating the latest version(s) of Ghostery approach being unusable.  I have version 8.0.1.2. Browsing is very, very slow (with the message 'Waiting on extension Ghostery').  The problem with needing to load websites more than once in order to get proper styling/display remains.  Some sites simply don't function (you login to your account and then are immediately logged back out).

Like previous posters David and Peter, I've also been having issues after Ghostery's update to version 8.0.0.34. Some websites simply won't load unless Ghostery is paused (or even disabled). For several times now, a random page seems to originate the problem -
keeps loading indefinitely - and soon after every other browser tab becomes unresponsive. 
I've been a long time Ghostery user and would like to thank you for all your hard work over the years, but I've recently had to stop using ghostery as it's become too much of a hassle. As David Friedman pointed out, there isn't much use to it if it has to be continuously disabled to access content.

Love Ghostery! I was having so many problems with pop up's in the form of ads and videos unrelated to my search. This caused great disruption to my service. Since installing Ghostery these problems have stopped. I have had no trouble pausing Ghostery to allow comments to load or simply indicating that Ghostery should "trust this site".
I'd like to note that my Android phone had been completely hijacked by Ad Choices. Installing Ghostery stopped that also.

I've used this app for ever and now uninstalled it after this horrific update.  It no longer quietly works in the background but has a continual PURPLE list along the right hand side of the screen, listing all the trackers that are blocked, and which continually fills in and shifts and piles up with every page you load or as you sit and browse. This not only blocks the entire side of each page but also PRINTS if you print anything.  There's no way to take this off the page unless you manually move your hand/cursor/mouse and "X" it down after which it pops right back up and is now part of your page/screen/Life. Since Google analytics is on every page, let alone 20-50 blocked trackers you will have this giant purple list on every page, always (I had over 100 on one site and have at times 8 tabs open if not 3 browsers) Ghostery is an intrusive mess of epic proportions now. There's no fast, temporary way to suspend the app like there used to be if you're on your banking site or somewhere they need to give you a Cookie, or you find you have to let them see who you are for that moment or are having a problem signing in on some shopping site and figure you'll just turn off your adblocker and Ghostery for a second and see if that's the issue (and it usually is).  This whole app has changed and is no longer usable, user friendly or QUIET.  It makes the whole comp jerky, makes websites lag and Chrome is running with so much RAM being used (yes, I tested it with and without..it IS Ghostery causing it) that it was just simpler (and sad) to get rid of it.  We also had to uninstall it at my office because we're trying to conference call and Skype and we have this GIANT PURPLE LIST popping up while we're showing each other stuff on the web we're researching.  It's now impossible to take screen shot because Ghostery is in the way of trying to browse and use your computer.  But hey! Why shouldn't they own you like every other app thinks they do out there?  Wrong. Ghostery --  Get it together and put the old version up again until you put out a better update.

I used this extensions for years and it always delivered, what it promised, like noticeable faster loading webpages, blocked trackers and much more, though it broke some webpages.

Changing to one star, how do I revert back this update, cant do anything

I discovered this tool working on web performance projects, and now I tell everyone I meet to download and use it immediately, not for privacy concerns, but mainly for making the web 30% faster. For the major enterprise websites I look at, the combined third party analytics tracking pixels and calls contributes to 30% of the end to end download time in browser sessions. Given this realization, I wouldnt be surprised if the analytics industry is fighting tooth and nail to prevent a plugin like this from becoming a default feature of newer browser updates. Get ready for popups on your favorite site saying "please disable blocking tools to access our content"

I replied to a comment below that to fix the issue you had to remove the Ghostery then install it again. I'd like to clarify that this doesn't work for long, its still messing up Facebook and Youtube (and prob other sites I don't know about).

The only option you have is to either pause blocking or whitelist the websites. Which kind of defeats the purpose of this extension.
-------------------------
break
I loved this extension until it started breaking Facebook to the point where it only showed raw HTML whenever I navigated to facebook.com. Pity about this... Perhaps if this issue is fixed I will use it again, but until then I will have to find something else.
-------------------------
load
I identified this app as the one preventing my facebook, messenger and youtube sites from loading in the correct format (they were just displaying text). Until and Update comes out I will not be using the extension.
-------------------------
reload
JUST PAUSE IT & RELOAD ! ..It's NOT rocket science ! ( unless UR a moron)
-------------------------
load
Yes! I just had this problem and couldn't figure out why Youtube and Facebook wasn't loading. So I disable my extensions one by one and Ghostery was the culprit. Not sure what is going on but please fix this devs!!!!!
-------------------------
access
Too hard to figure out how to allow the information you want to be accessed. Used it for about 3 weeks, and will discard it today.
-------------------------
access
Way too often it blocks too much preventing access to basic sites. However, it is very easy to adjust and change what it blocks either in settings or on the page to unblock components required to view it.

Strange. I've tried it in Opera, sometime ago in Chrome, and Firefox. 
And in all 3 it seems to cause plenty of slow-downs. And issues loading sites.

Ghostry blocks so many ads, pop-ups and unwanted scripts that load in background that now it saves huge amount of bandwidth. Mostly when am on youtube, the autoplay of ads before you can skip it to actual video is saving almost 8-10GB of bandwidth every month! Kudos to Ghostery team

I'm concerned with a new feature.

The CMP will allow us to message our users directly in their browser with product announcements, promotions, and other appropriate notifications.  This  messaging system and can be turned off at any time by accessing the advanced tab of the options menu.

There isn't a good explanation exactly how they plan to use this, but it could certainly be abused.  To their credit you can disable it.
-------------------------

This causes more trouble than it's worth. Hard to use paypal or shop online because this breaks the checkout process. And that makes me nervous because I never know if the site has been compromised or if ghostery is jacking things up. Most problems occur when I try and use paypal to pay for my stuff on a site.

Uninstalling. Too much trouble and it doesn't play nice.
-------------------------
load
I've been using it for years now, but oddly enough didn't decide to comment until now lol... I would rate 5 stars, but for some sites, even putting it on pause, or turning it off still doesn't allow some legit sites to load. Bottomline when used with an ad blocking extension it gives us an extra layer of protection but with the ad blocker and Ghostery running at the same time even on a 64b browser it can slow loading time of pages by up to 15 seconds of staring at a blank white page while it loads.
-------------------------
stop
I was a skeptic up until the point where I loaded the app and went to my usual sites, I couldn't believe how many things were tracking me and how easy it was to stop them and reload the page with the peace of mind knowing that this Chrome Extension had blocked them. I have one slight issue, it seems to forget my selections after a reboot, but apparently that isn't a general issue.
-------------------------

Really like this for my Chrome but lately it disappears and I have to go into extensions to reload it.

Can't live without this extension! Now I understand why loading pages takes so long sometimes.

Recently it's been causing major problems..  Nothing loads, just says waiting for ghostery extension.  I hope you fix this huge problem soon, we've come to count on the security and privacy this provides.
-------------------------

Most amazing extension I have seen so far on chrome. I went on a site that had a small Facebook button. I clicked on my new Ghostery extension and blocked the Facebook tracking. I then reloaded, and looked at the Facebook button again. A little Ghost figure rested over top of the button with a little X-out sign next to it. This is only more proof that this works and is effective. I have other ad tracking viewers and when I disable the tracking site on this app the site on the other app disappears. GET THIS NOW.
-------------------------
stop
Works well. Now if I could only get it to stop showing the tab at startup that has all the open tabs on it I would be overjoyed. Very redundant as the open tabs are already open and showing in my browser. Nitpicking but its annoying
-------------------------

breaks a lot of sites, how do i uninstall it?
-------------------------
access
super useful tool to gain 3rd party site visibility and control of their access to read your PI and write tracking or other code to your system without your permission.  My question is, how much of your personal info does Ghostery see?
-------------------------
load
I literally could not use the internet while this was running.  I thought something was wrong with my internet connection until I finally "paused" Ghostery and everything started working properly again.  Websites took FOREVER to load, Netflix included! Maybe I selected too many trackers to block, but not worth the headache it caused!
-------------------------
error
Per PC Magazine, Ghostery tracks and sells the information to another data gathering monger! They fail to mention this in their details about this extension. I could not find this information anywhere else on their site either. No notice that they are tracking and passing our info onto another tracking service! What a scam! It looks like they are catching tons of trackers but then taking what they track and giving that info away? Bad form!
Also, it's not functioning as it is supposed to. I'm receiving an error now. It seemed to be working fine until recently. The error states it's not tracking...and mentions a list of trackers it's not tracking! What's up with this app and the appearance of web safety when in fact they are tracking us and passing on that information? What's the use?
-------------------------
stop
A must for surfing the net.  Stops all pesky tracking at once!
-------------------------
load
I have to pause or disable ghostery in order for my web pages to load properly. Got any facebook games you like to play? Nope, got to disable it in order to play. I found myself disabling it more often than having it active. So I uninstalled it. Now every time Chrome opens, it re installs itself. I'm getting real sick of uninstalling it every time I open Chrome.
-------------------------
bug
I kept getting the "waiting for cache" bug, found out it was AdBlock Plus, but didn't want to run with ads. Ghostery blocks with the best of em and doesn't cause "waiting for cache" lag!
-------------------------
error
I think Ghostery's great for what it does. I suggest all surfers of the net to use this. My two baseline security programs on my computer are Norton & Malwarebytes. The 3rd program that was suggested I install & use was Ghostery. Initially I went to Ghostery's main website to download this program. When I did I immediately received notification that it wasn't compatible with the version of Windows Explorer that's currently running on my laptop.
 The good thing is that I don't use Windows Explorer to surf the waves of the net. I use Google! So, remembering that there's a Ghostery app in the Google store I then added the Ghostery app to my Google and now I'm running the 3 main security programs my personal tech support suggested I run & use on my laptop. I'm extremely happy with the performance & level of security that I maintain on my now 6 month old laptop. Not a single problem! Not a single error! Not a single hiccup! I highly suggest running this app in conjunction to your other security programs and/or apps that you already run.

Ghostery > Disconnect. If you do a side-by-side comparison, you'll notice that Ghostery blocks more stuff than Disconnect. Seriously! Right down to the point where you can go down blocking share buttons! Of course, it makes webpages load 1 second slower than Disconnect. But I prefer privacy, over speed. Hopefully, in the future though, Ghostery will be just as fast as Disconnect.

Fantastic!  Intrusions ...if someone can access your data or see what you are viewing they can likely hack too. Blocking is the best way to go.

Pop-up notification bubbles and the hard-headed dev who won't stop them

Ghostery is a good product that does what it claims it will do; and does it with aplomb.  And so I give it five stars for that, at least, since that's the most important thing.

However, there's also something about it that makes me furious; and I think anyone who's thinking of using Ghostery should know about it.  So here it is...

I keep writing to the dev and telling him to stop popping-up notification bubbles in the upper-right corner of my browser. He keep writing back and telling me how to go into settings and turn them off, which, of course, I do. I'm not stupid; I've been an IT pro for pushing 40 years and I'm pretty sure I know how to configure an app.

The problem is, and has always been, that the app, even after I've turned-off all pop-up notification bubbles, nevertheless still pops-up such bubbles at least to notify me of that the database has been updated; or that there's been some other kind of update.

I don't want to see those kinds of bubbles, either; and there seems no way to turn them off in the app's settings. And the dev seems to think it's okay to interrupt people's work in their browsers with such notifications.

Certain app developers just insist on their apps being the center of everything. They don't seem to get that their app is just one app of many on most people's computers, and all computer users just want their apps to work, and be quiet about it.

Devs of Chrome plugins/extensions who pop-open a whole new tab to announce that their app has just updated are the worst offenders, of course. Abine's DO-NOT-TRACK-ME did that yesterday, and nearly froze my browser right in the middle of my typing something that was on a deadline. I was so angry I almost screamed out loud.

What Ghostery does, with the pop-up bubble notifications of updates are almost as bad; and no amount of complaining about it, and describing it seems to get through the thick skull of its developer, who insists that as long as I've turned-off all notifications in the app's settings, then I shouldn't be seeing any bubbles.

One time one of said bubbles popped-up to tell me that Ghostery's database had updated literally while I was reading his email insisting that I must not have configured the app properly.

Ghostery's dev, then, is, in my opinion, an awful kind of intransigent bully who's incapable of taking the necessary giant step back from himself and his work to honestly ask himself if someone else could possibly be right.

Shame on him. Persons considering using Ghostery should make sure their eyes are wide open about the kind of person is its dev.

It's a good blocker, but they sell the data to the companies you're trying to avoid when you're subscribed to ghostrank (which is on by default).  Just on that principle, I use Disconnect, which is a lot better anyway (doesn't break sites etc.) I'd suggest everybody move to Disconnect as it does the same things, as well as encrypting your connections when available (which Ghostery doesn't do). And they don't sell or store any data on you.

If you decide to use this extension instead of Disconnect, MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF GHOSTRANK if you don't want your browsing data sold to the same advertisement companies you're trying to avoid.
-------------------------
bug
Great app, and I love the fine-grained control over which type of trackers it blocks. I especially like that it shows you what specifically it blocks, but it always bugged me that the shortest time you could set the popup to display for is 3 seconds. 

If anyone else is having the same problem, you can fix this by going into the options page for the extension, clicking "Inspect HTML element" over the dropdown where you choose the time to display for, right-clicking the highlighted HTML element in the source editor and selecting "Edit HTML", replacing the number with your desired time, and hitting "Save Options" at the bottom of the page. Presto! As much control over the display time as you want!
-------------------------
break
It seems like every time I boot up my computer the Ghostery configuration page pops up. What's with that?  

I have had a lot of problems with the cursor jumping around the page and with certain sites when I clicked 'like' (not Facebook) the view would jump to the top. I tested all the extensions and it's definitely Ghostery. That and the config page popping up all the time and the fact the whole thing breaks regularly is a deal breaker for me. Shame because like the little girl, when it was good, it was very very good, but now it is bad, it is horrid.
-------------------------
access
This is a must for real privacy if you are willing to spend some time refining it a little as you browse so the sites you need to work (and which sacrifice your privacy) are given some leeway. With this, you decide who, where, when, and why any site (or any snooping corporation) gets access to data on your system or gets to track you everywhere you go.

Do not trust that your browser alone can protect you, especially if you are using Chrome, Safari, or IE. Get this now and then add HTTPS Everywhere as well.

Takes tweaking if you want to enjoy a full compliment of websites without disturbing their functionality. For instance, this app, when blocking all trackers, sometimes makes my Google surfing rough. To be more specific, I have found it necessary to turn the Ghostery blocking options "on" or "off" based on the visited website demands. It keeps pics from loading on some sites, keeps forms from working, and so forth. This isn't ghosterys' fault, and they must have seen it coming because they have a built-in workaround in the shape of editing preferences for each site. Very helpful extension, IMHO.

Great plugin! Getting rid of all those nasty social plugins that are trying to collect data without an opt-out possibility. 

Some sites may have broken functionality, and sometimes you need something that Ghostery blocks, it would be nice if Ghostery had an option to temporarily allow one or more bugs to run.

Also, but this is more of a Chrome problem, it doesn't block as much as Ghostery for Firefox does. I hope Chrome will offer a decent blocking API in the future.

Ghostery does what it claims, but implementation could be better.  The pop-ups are annoying and make no mention of being from Ghostery.  I wanted them to stop, but it took awhile to even figure out what was causing them.  Playing with my extension made me realize it was Ghostery, so I disabled it.

Good afternoon. I don't know what's happened, but as of today the Ghostery browser extension has just stopped working for me. I didn't have this problem last night, but as of booting up this afternoon I've had ads everywhere. First caught it on YouTube when I suddenly got ads on videos.

Hi, I am fan of the extension, but since lately I get a LOT of errors and my console is filling up with the following errors: content_script_bundle.js:16 Uncaught TypeError: c.querySelectorAll is not a function at MutationObserver.<anonymous> (content_script_bundle.js:16) (anonymous) @ content_script_bundle.js:16 childList (async) empty @ jquery.min.js?5331f235996d367c49266e9eb4cc9109:2 (anonymous) @ jquery.min.js?5331f235996d367c49266e9eb4cc9109:2 K @ jquery.min.js?5331f235996d367c49266e9eb4cc9109:2 text @ jquery.min.js?5331f235996d367c49266e9eb4cc9109:2 (anonymous) @ dashboard.min.js:4520 each @ jquery.min.js?5331f235996d367c49266e9eb4cc9109:2 (anonymous) @ dashboard.min.js:4505 each @ jquery.min.js?5331f235996d367c49266e9eb4cc9109:2 showRates @ dashboard.min.js:4500 socketMessagesHandler @ dashboard.min.js:1009 (anonymous) @ sockets.min.js:2 n.emit @ universalModuleDefinition:2 n.onevent @ universalModuleDefinition:3 n.onpacket @ universalModuleDefinition:3 (anonymous) @ universalModuleDefinition:3 n.emit @ universalModuleDefinition:2 n.ondecoded @ universalModuleDefinition:1 (anonymous) @ universalModuleDefinition:3 r.emit @ universalModuleDefinition:1 s.add @ universalModuleDefinition:1 n.ondata @ universalModuleDefinition:1 (anonymous) @ universalModuleDefinition:3 n.emit @ universalModuleDefinition:2 n.onPacket @ universalModuleDefinition:2 (anonymous) @ universalModuleDefinition:2 n.emit @ universalModuleDefinition:2 n.onPacket @ universalModuleDefinition:2 n.onData @ universalModuleDefinition:2 ws.onmessage @ universalModuleDefinition:3 content_script_bundle.js:53 Uncaught Error: Extension context invalidated. at e.sendFunction (content_script_bundle.js:53) at e.value (content_script_bundle.js:53) at content_script_bundle.js:1 at content_script_bundle.js:1 (anonymous) @ content_script_bundle.js:53 value @ content_script_bundle.js:53 (anonymous) @ content_script_bundle.js:1 (anonymous) @ content_script_bundle.js:1 content_script_bundle.js:53 Uncaught Error: Extension context invalidated. at e.sendFunction (content_script_bundle.js:53) at e.value (content_script_bundle.js:53) at content_script_bundle.js:1 at content_script_bundle.js:1 Hope you can fix it, otherwise I will have to remove the extension.

I am using Chrome 71.0.3578.98 on a Mac with Mac OS 10.14.2. I get an intermittent error when trying to upload a file testing a local web app as follows: Uncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: currentURL is not defined at then.catch.e (content_script_bundle.js:13) Ghostery blocks the file upload dialog from appearing. I tried the following solutions: 1. Added localhost as a trusted site 2. Paused Ghostery None of these solutions work. In order to get the file dialog again, I had to disable the extension. When I enabled the extension again, it stopped working again. The file did not show up every time in the javascript console, it was intermittent but the file dialog is blocked every time.

Recently, I have been finding more and more sites not working because the captcha widget isn't loading. It's not obvious which service to unblock for this, and I have found sites where Ghostery doesn't show anything being blocked (though I think it showed 1 being blocked by count, but nothing on the right side of the dialog). I would either like captcha to be not blocked, or at least some way to know what to unblock.

Hi, I never had any issues with Ghostery installed, but lately, a lot of websites load way slower than usual, and often it says something like "waiting for Ghostery extension" in the loading field in the lower left corner of Chrome.

Since installing Ghostery on a Windows 10 system, images on several websites won't load until a specific tracker is allowed. The same tracker is blocked on my Windows 7 system and images load without a problem. Also login into Origin wasn't possible without pausing ghostery complete. Enabling the trackers wasn't enough.

20-30 minutes ago, Chrome crashed while it was open and in use. Since then, it continues to crash within 10 seconds of opening. I see a bar near the top of the window that says "Chrome didn't shut down correctly: Restore". The launching animation for Chrome from my desktop (Macbook Pro) lags/stutters where it didn't before. I eventually discovered that if I disabled Ghostery, the problems would stop. As soon as I enable Ghostery, the behavior return. I do have multiple chrome extensions installed, like AdBlock.

As to Ghostery (v. 5.4.2) my browser Google Chrome (v. 41.0.2272.89 m) is reporting the following as a continuing issue: This extension can not redirect a network request to data:application/javascript;base64,dmFy[...]H19 because another extension (Disconnect) has redirected the request to about: blank. I wrote to Disconnect (installed is v. 5.18.19) about this issue, and this was their answer: Unfortunately, Ghostery changed their extension away from the standard redirect that all the other Chrome blocking extensions use - there's nothing we can do about it without breaking compatibility with some much larger extensions (namely Adblock). You might consider writing to them.

I don't understand it in full but Blur is being upset by the new version of Ghostery. I have had problems before with Blur being upset by the Privacy manager 2.9 Extension , BUT , that was due to me tweaking the settings of Privacy manager , I have some idea of the cause & effect of the Privacy Manager & Blur clash , but since I haven't tweaked Ghostery in many months , I feel your recent update may be at fault or at least partially at fault. My brain no longer works properly after a recent mild stroke , so fixing things of a technical nature is impossible , living is getting to be a major chore actually..... I hope the error code I pasted in above may be able to help you fix the problem , if it is in fact your problem. Jet Black Australian internet user since 1994.

I'm using this super extention in chrome and firefox (both latest versions for W7). But since I use it I notice that the CPU is working a lot harder (normally around 9% now around 46%), and the time is going into chrome and firefox. (This is not green! It results worldwide in a use amount of extra energy consumed, we are talking about the size of several powerplants) Bigger problem is that both browsers are crashing a lot. When I disable ghostery the crashing and timeconsuming stops. When I google https://www.google.nl/search?q=ghoserey+increase+cpu+usage I see more reports. Is there any development on these problems.

I keep writing to the dev and telling him to stop popping-up notification bubbles in the upper-right corner of my browser. He keep writing back and telling me how to go into settings and turn them off, which, of course, I do. I'm not stupid; I've been an IT pro for pushing 40 years and I'm pretty sure I know how to configure an app. The problem is, and has always been, that the app, even after I've turned-off all pop-up notification bubbles, nevertheless still pops-up such bubbles at least to notify me of that the database has been updated; or that there's been some other kind of update. I don't want to see those kinds of bubbles, either; and there seems no way to turn them off in the app's settings. And the dev seems to think it's okay to interrupt people's work in their browsers with such notifications. Certain app developers just insist on their apps being the center of everything. They don't seem to get that their app is just one app of many on most people's computers, and all computer users just want their apps to work, and be quiet about it. Devs of Chrome plugins/extensions who pop-open a whole new tab to announce that their app has just updated are the worst offenders, of course. Abine's DO-NOT-TRACK-ME did that yesterday, and nearly froze my browser right in the middle of my typing something that was on a deadline. I was so angry I almost screamed out loud. What Ghostery does, with the pop-up bubble notifications of updates are almost as bad; and no amount of complaining about it, and describing it seems to get through the thick skull of its developer, who insists that as long as I've turned-off all notifications in the app's settings, then I shouldn't be seeing any bubbles. One time one of said bubbles popped-up to tell me that Ghostery's database had updated literally while I was reading his email insisting that I must not have configured the app properly. Ghostery's dev, then, is, in my opinion, an awful kind of intransigent bully who's incapable of taking the necessary giant step back from himself and his work to honestly ask himself if someone else could possibly be right. Shame on him. Persons considering using Ghostery should make sure their eyes are wide open about the kind of person is its dev. __________________________________ Gregg L.

Normally, for extra protection when surfing the web, a user might turn to incognito mode. But in incognito mode only ensures that your browsing history is not stored on your computer, but the data still trickles out to these third parties like google or facebook. Can this add-on stop those third parties from having our data ?
-------------------------
javascript
I've used Ghostery for years but will no longer.
The newest update, even when websites are marked trusted, ghostery would disable crucial javascript for uploading content via file explorer to any website.
An example is if you go to imgur and go to upload a file and click the browse button to what's supposed to open a file explorer window to all you to select the file(s) you wish to upload. After spending considerable time troubleshooting, I discovered the Ghostery extension was causing the Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT Console errors preventing the javascript opening a window to upload files. This mind you, was for ANY button on ANY website (I tested everything from major websites to edu websites). I mean.. I didn't have to once I discovered the issue was Ghostery but before that when troubleshooting I did. I will never use Ghostery again for Google Chrome... and with features Chrome has added you don't need to anymore.. so really neither should anyone else. Again, even with a website marked as trusted (which I doubled checked again with Ghostery re-installed) Ghostery still preventing this safe and normal javascripts from loading which enable the ability to upload files via a file browser window.

It's a good plugin for blocking scripts, 3rd party web stuff, beacons, trackers and the likes, easy to use though I started to find the changes to the UI were a bit unnecessary.
You should be able to install this on multiple browsers on multiple devices, sign in with the same account and have your settings synced, but it kept signing me out more times than I could be bothered to sign back in.

I installed it and ran it in its default one-click setting. I tested it on some privacy sites like Electronic Frontier Organization's Panopticlick. It passed in "blocking tracking ads" and "stop trackers included in the so-called acceptable whitelist ads" but failed in "blocking invisible trackers" and in "unblock third parties that promise to honor do not track." 

It didn't pass fingerprinting, but I am still looking for something that will pass that test.

TERRIBLY slow extension which dramatically slows the load time for all my sites, getting a "Waiting for Ghostery" message in the status bar all the time. Even on Trusted sites. This should NOT be. If not for this, I would have given at least 4/5. Please fix!

Furthermore, this extension fails to actually prevent the download of blocked JavaScript. Preventing JavaScript from running is something Chrome can do by itself. I was to flat out deny the scripts from even being downloaded to my machine.

Update 9.8.16
Changing to one star, how do I revert back this update, cant do anything

I discovered this tool working on web performance projects, and now I tell everyone I meet to download and use it immediately, not for privacy concerns, but mainly for making the web 30% faster. For the major enterprise websites I look at, the combined third party analytics tracking pixels and calls contributes to 30% of the end to end download time in browser sessions. Given this realization, I wouldnt be surprised if the analytics industry is fighting tooth and nail to prevent a plugin like this from becoming a default feature of newer browser updates. Get ready for popups on your favorite site saying "please disable blocking tools to access our content"

Brilliant app! Doesn't affect the speed of the Chrome Browser and identifies and blocks tracking and targeting by third (or fourth) party agents. This should be a standard feature built into Chrome!

super useful tool to gain 3rd party site visibility and control of their access to read your PI and write tracking or other code to your system without your permission.  My question is, how much of your personal info does Ghostery see?
-------------------------
3rd
I think Ghostery's great for what it does. I suggest all surfers of the net to use this. My two baseline security programs on my computer are Norton & Malwarebytes. The 3rd program that was suggested I install & use was Ghostery. Initially I went to Ghostery's main website to download this program. When I did I immediately received notification that it wasn't compatible with the version of Windows Explorer that's currently running on my laptop.
 The good thing is that I don't use Windows Explorer to surf the waves of the net. I use Google! So, remembering that there's a Ghostery app in the Google store I then added the Ghostery app to my Google and now I'm running the 3 main security programs my personal tech support suggested I run & use on my laptop. I'm extremely happy with the performance & level of security that I maintain on my now 6 month old laptop. Not a single problem! Not a single error! Not a single hiccup! I highly suggest running this app in conjunction to your other security programs and/or apps that you already run.

It's funny someone makes a script to block trackers but yet logs everything you do. There are many reports of Ghostery selling it to third party companies. Get real people your destroying the sites you love using this addon or ABP!

This is the best way to detect 3rd parties and hidden items performing tracking on a web site.

The only thing I don't like about it is that it cannot currently tell the difference between opt-out cookies and id cookies.  

This would be a nice feature, and it would be even nicer if it could "lock in" opt-out cookies and detect when a company does not obey their opt out cookie and  allow you to notify the company (in case it is a rouge affiliate) and the service boards they belong to.

While i love this extension i noticed that serval trackers turned themselves off. this is extremely disappointing as you'd assume ghostery actually values providing the privacy they claim to for their users.

Used this extension for about 3 years. Today, they decided users would want to see how many trackers are on each website in search engine results, like google for example. In what world would the average user want to see an obtrusive icon to tell them this information. Just because you have the data doesn't mean the average user cares about that data specifically. Imagine other extensions that a user has also being this obnoxious. It doesn't scale well. Please make it a toggle option or remove it. Because I've used this for so long, holding off on uninstalling for a week or so to see if this will be corrected.

No one has commented here since 2019 and its 2022 so I will say this in 2022 this app has become annoying with popups that try and force feed you "updates" that are frankly worse rather than better and after the update and it working EVEN WORSE YET AGAIN not blocking the ads but LETTING THEM THROUGH on sites such as "watchseries" where it was once the go to app for blocking trackers and ads you are better off seeking alternitives today the company is more concerned with letting trackers buy there way in than keeping them out of my web browsing experience sadly

I really do not like the purple overlay at the bottom right hand corner of the screen that lists blocked trackers.  There is seemingly no way to turn it off.

I really like and have used Ghostery for years, but I am very concerned about the new "Smart blocking" "feature" which I recommend that you turn off.
Why? Because while Ghostery's intent may have been to offer better functionality and speedier browsing for users through "artificl intelligence", the "smart blocking" feature appears to completely override all of your current settings in a way that is non-transparent and very hostile to privacy.
Evidence? Visit Lastpass.com with all trackers blocked and smart blocking turned on. Check out the detailed view for a long list of advertising and analytics trackers automatically and quietly  "unblocked" - you will be shocked.

I like the protection the extension offers and I am pleased with most of the operation and settings.  The one thing I would really like to turn off is the popup in the lower right corner of each page.  I am sure that several people like this, but I find it annoying.  I would prefer the application just works instead of notifying me every time I load a page, follow a link to a new page on the same site or just researching something through hundreds of pages.  I checked the extension settings and I did not find a way to turn this off.  Closing it only makes things worse as I have to interact with it and it just comes back on the next page or new tab.  I would rather a popup only if there is a problem.

Love Ghostery, but the new update is causing me to not be able to click on certain links on some websites. I talked to my dev team at work and they are looking into it, but no idea what's going on at this point. I turn off Ghostery and the links work, turn it on and I can't click certain things.

Suddenly Uploads are being blocked. Disabled every extension, one at at time, it was Ghostery. Always worked flawlessly before, January 2019 it started blocking BUFFER app (Social Media Scheduling) and Tweetdeck (Twitter) from uploading images. There was nothing in the settings to alter, tried reset of Chrome, which worked until Ghostery started, then uploading was being blocked again from my own computer.  (PC)  Chrome, AVG, and Malwarebytes were running and unaffected. All other sources including Windows Defender were not the problem. Cannot use it until that problem gets addressed. Turned it off 4 minutes ago and suffering serious withdrawals and popups ;)

Ghostery was one of my top favorite apps, but no more...  I feel betrayed on a deep level by Ghostery... For about a month now, another one of my pop up blocker has been going crazy asking if I want to block a popup, just by clicking on nothingness on sites, even my own college sites at them, and when allowed I got taken to a random ad site.... I thought it was malware at first cause it was effecting .org sites even.... Then I accused the very pop up blocker warning me, but when I turned it off, I was suddenly sent to these ad sites automatically with no defence.... Luckily I only had a few extensions and after trail and error, I was left in disbelief at Ghostery, turned it off, and the problem's gone.... Ghostery, an extension designed to help you, has turned into an internal ad program... I feel betrayed and depart with a goodbye.

manual
Should automatically add new cookies and other objects to the filter, instead you have to manually add them yourself.

They have a number of bugs that are breaking the ability to view high profile websites.

Now it just auto disables everything on update instead of forcing you to manually add new trackers. I get that it wants to allow websites to function but this is dishonest. I don't care if it's open source, your designing default behavior to be disingenuous and counter intuitive. Fix your product and stop making excuses about why you aren't communicating terrible functionality changes. That or stop making the terrible changes to begin with and you won't see as much backlash.

Be very careful. It used to be really aggressive out of the box to block trackers. Now, it's being sneaky and allowing certain trackers to follow you in the name of attempting to enhance the user experience. I half wonder if they are "white listing" trackers just like Ad Blocker did a while back. Just be careful with this extension;  they are not fully what they let on to be. I use other means to augment rather than solely depending on this extension. I noticed that unless you black list a site manually, you may not get 100% blocking of trackers that it finds. Highly frustrating that you don't get what's advertised.
-------------------------

Hey Martin,

No Trackers are whitelisted. The Smart blocking feature is designed to fix the "page break" issue that many users complained about.. if the tracker takes longer than 3 seconds to load we unblock it so there is no page disruption. You can turn that off and no longer have that available, but there may be issues with the page functionality.

I like Ghostery very much. It works quite well. But apparently Ghostery doesn't like me. Or more specifically any user that turns off notifications and/or sharing settings. I turn all of this off every time Ghostery updates. Yep, that's right. Any update that I've received turns it right back on. And more specifically my settings do not carry over from machine to machine. Even though Ghostery has allowed me to create a profile to, supposedly, sync settings.

this is a helpful app with one fatal flaw -- when you tag a site as Trusted, the app still keeps running trying to count and evaluate the trackers.

there is no option to turn this 'feature' off -- stupid.

manual
I've used this app for ever and now uninstalled it after this horrific update.  It no longer quietly works in the background but has a continual PURPLE list along the right hand side of the screen, listing all the trackers that are blocked, and which continually fills in and shifts and piles up with every page you load or as you sit and browse. This not only blocks the entire side of each page but also PRINTS if you print anything.  There's no way to take this off the page unless you manually move your hand/cursor/mouse and "X" it down after which it pops right back up and is now part of your page/screen/Life. Since Google analytics is on every page, let alone 20-50 blocked trackers you will have this giant purple list on every page, always (I had over 100 on one site and have at times 8 tabs open if not 3 browsers) Ghostery is an intrusive mess of epic proportions now. There's no fast, temporary way to suspend the app like there used to be if you're on your banking site or somewhere they need to give you a Cookie, or you find you have to let them see who you are for that moment or are having a problem signing in on some shopping site and figure you'll just turn off your adblocker and Ghostery for a second and see if that's the issue (and it usually is).  This whole app has changed and is no longer usable, user friendly or QUIET.  It makes the whole comp jerky, makes websites lag and Chrome is running with so much RAM being used (yes, I tested it with and without..it IS Ghostery causing it) that it was just simpler (and sad) to get rid of it.  We also had to uninstall it at my office because we're trying to conference call and Skype and we have this GIANT PURPLE LIST popping up while we're showing each other stuff on the web we're researching.  It's now impossible to take screen shot because Ghostery is in the way of trying to browse and use your computer.  But hey! Why shouldn't they own you like every other app thinks they do out there?  Wrong. Ghostery --  Get it together and put the old version up again until you put out a better update.

Not a fan of the recent update. While it works for me (unlike for some people, it seems), they've removed options that previously existed, including the ability to hide an annoying badge count that shows how many trackers have been blocked on a website. Badge counts are one of the first features I turn OFF on any extension that has them. They are distracting to the eye and pointless. 

I emailed Ghostery about this, asking if I was just missing where to turn this off now, and received this reply: "The badger [sic] counter is a non removable feature in Ghostery 7." No apologies, no promises for change, just a middle finger. 

You know what isn't "non-removable"? Ghostery.

I'm concerned with a new feature.

The CMP will allow us to message our users directly in their browser with product announcements, promotions, and other appropriate notifications.  This  messaging system and can be turned off at any time by accessing the advanced tab of the options menu.

There isn't a good explanation exactly how they plan to use this, but it could certainly be abused.  To their credit you can disable it.

I've been using it for years now, but oddly enough didn't decide to comment until now lol... I would rate 5 stars, but for some sites, even putting it on pause, or turning it off still doesn't allow some legit sites to load. Bottomline when used with an ad blocking extension it gives us an extra layer of protection but with the ad blocker and Ghostery running at the same time even on a 64b browser it can slow loading time of pages by up to 15 seconds of staring at a blank white page while it loads.

I highly recommend Ghostery. I'm a tad OCD and I researched and tried a lot of privacy extensions like NoScript, DoNotTrackMe and Disconnect before deciding that my fave was Ghostery. If you feel annoyed about all the companies and even stats-obsessed bloggers aggressively tracking you, this is a must-have extension (and if you're not that concerned about your privacy, your loss bc a tracker+cookie can reveal A LOT about you). Subscribing to EasyPrivacy List or Fanboy Annoyances/Social List through ABP is not enough. You need an extension to be able to block everything and control what you block. Ghostie blocks pretty much everything for me (though I feel like it works even better in Firefox) and I can allow certain widgets I use frequently, like disqus and soundcloud, and whitelist certain sites I trust. I would recommend you turn off the alert bubble and choose "block new elements by default". If Ghostery blocks too much stuff for you, just toggle off blocking on widgets. Overall, great, easy-to-use extension.

Pop-up notification bubbles and the hard-headed dev who won't stop them

Ghostery is a good product that does what it claims it will do; and does it with aplomb.  And so I give it five stars for that, at least, since that's the most important thing.

However, there's also something about it that makes me furious; and I think anyone who's thinking of using Ghostery should know about it.  So here it is...

I keep writing to the dev and telling him to stop popping-up notification bubbles in the upper-right corner of my browser. He keep writing back and telling me how to go into settings and turn them off, which, of course, I do. I'm not stupid; I've been an IT pro for pushing 40 years and I'm pretty sure I know how to configure an app.

The problem is, and has always been, that the app, even after I've turned-off all pop-up notification bubbles, nevertheless still pops-up such bubbles at least to notify me of that the database has been updated; or that there's been some other kind of update.

I don't want to see those kinds of bubbles, either; and there seems no way to turn them off in the app's settings. And the dev seems to think it's okay to interrupt people's work in their browsers with such notifications.

Certain app developers just insist on their apps being the center of everything. They don't seem to get that their app is just one app of many on most people's computers, and all computer users just want their apps to work, and be quiet about it.

Devs of Chrome plugins/extensions who pop-open a whole new tab to announce that their app has just updated are the worst offenders, of course. Abine's DO-NOT-TRACK-ME did that yesterday, and nearly froze my browser right in the middle of my typing something that was on a deadline. I was so angry I almost screamed out loud.

What Ghostery does, with the pop-up bubble notifications of updates are almost as bad; and no amount of complaining about it, and describing it seems to get through the thick skull of its developer, who insists that as long as I've turned-off all notifications in the app's settings, then I shouldn't be seeing any bubbles.

One time one of said bubbles popped-up to tell me that Ghostery's database had updated literally while I was reading his email insisting that I must not have configured the app properly.

Ghostery's dev, then, is, in my opinion, an awful kind of intransigent bully who's incapable of taking the necessary giant step back from himself and his work to honestly ask himself if someone else could possibly be right.

Shame on him. Persons considering using Ghostery should make sure their eyes are wide open about the kind of person is its dev.

I love how people are so afraid of their privacy. Most of these scripts they block are scripts to help webmaster better serve you. Then they get mad when all the stuff doesn't work when they visit a site since Ghostery disabled something on it they cry and send emails. Well your using a addon that blocks certain functions of a site. If your so afraid get off the internet. I can't wait to start a website that starts blocking these types of addons. Also your hurt websites when you block advertisements though even you don't click on them they still get add impressions. If you choose to block advertisements don't use sites that are supported by ads so you get used to them no being there!
-------------------------
off
It's a good blocker, but they sell the data to the companies you're trying to avoid when you're subscribed to ghostrank (which is on by default).  Just on that principle, I use Disconnect, which is a lot better anyway (doesn't break sites etc.) I'd suggest everybody move to Disconnect as it does the same things, as well as encrypting your connections when available (which Ghostery doesn't do). And they don't sell or store any data on you.

If you decide to use this extension instead of Disconnect, MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF GHOSTRANK if you don't want your browsing data sold to the same advertisement companies you're trying to avoid.

Takes tweaking if you want to enjoy a full compliment of websites without disturbing their functionality. For instance, this app, when blocking all trackers, sometimes makes my Google surfing rough. To be more specific, I have found it necessary to turn the Ghostery blocking options "on" or "off" based on the visited website demands. It keeps pics from loading on some sites, keeps forms from working, and so forth. This isn't ghosterys' fault, and they must have seen it coming because they have a built-in workaround in the shape of editing preferences for each site. Very helpful extension, IMHO.

manual
While it's a useful plugin, it could make it easier to extract the URLs or domains to permit easier adding into Adblock.

I really do not like the purple overlay at the bottom right hand corner of the screen that lists blocked trackers.  There is seemingly no way to turn it off.  This means that this program, designed to block unwanted content, injects its own unwanted content.  Please give us an option to hide the reporting of blocked trackers.

I really like and have used Ghostery for years, but I am very concerned about the new "Smart blocking" "feature" which I recommend that you turn off.
Why? Because while Ghostery's intent may have been to offer better functionality and speedier browsing for users through "artificl intelligence", the "smart blocking" feature appears to completely override all of your current settings in a way that is non-transparent and very hostile to privacy.
Evidence? Visit Lastpass.com with all trackers blocked and smart blocking turned on. Check out the detailed view for a long list of advertising and analytics trackers automatically and quietly  "unblocked" - you will be shocked.

Just noticed that myself a few minutes ago, unless you  whitelist it. Hope they can get it fixed.
-------------------------

Used to be great, but recently has started to break continued authentication for some sites (Google, annoyingly, but also Medium), and can't keep itself logged in either, so all my whitelists that are supposed to benefit sites I don't mind ads on become useless. As the technical ability has gone down, things like Ghostery Rewards have gone up, and I find the downsides in getting sites working are not worth the upsides. Sorry Ghostery, long time user uninstalling.
-------------------------
filter
Should automatically add new cookies and other objects to the filter, instead you have to manually add them yourself.

They have a number of bugs that are breaking the ability to view high profile websites.

Now it just auto disables everything on update instead of forcing you to manually add new trackers. I get that it wants to allow websites to function but this is dishonest. I don't care if it's open source, your designing default behavior to be disingenuous and counter intuitive. Fix your product and stop making excuses about why you aren't communicating terrible functionality changes. That or stop making the terrible changes to begin with and you won't see as much backlash.
-------------------------
list
Be very careful. It used to be really aggressive out of the box to block trackers. Now, it's being sneaky and allowing certain trackers to follow you in the name of attempting to enhance the user experience. I half wonder if they are "white listing" trackers just like Ad Blocker did a while back. Just be careful with this extension;  they are not fully what they let on to be. I use other means to augment rather than solely depending on this extension. I noticed that unless you black list a site manually, you may not get 100% blocking of trackers that it finds. Highly frustrating that you don't get what's advertised.
-------------------------

Hey Martin,

No Trackers are whitelisted. The Smart blocking feature is designed to fix the "page break" issue that many users complained about.. if the tracker takes longer than 3 seconds to load we unblock it so there is no page disruption. You can turn that off and no longer have that available, but there may be issues with the page functionality. 
-------------------------
whitelist
I installed it and ran it in its default one-click setting. I tested it on some privacy sites like Electronic Frontier Organization's Panopticlick. It passed in "blocking tracking ads" and "stop trackers included in the so-called acceptable whitelist ads" but failed in "blocking invisible trackers" and in "unblock third parties that promise to honor do not track." 

It didn't pass fingerprinting, but I am still looking for something that will pass that test.
-------------------------

Slows down computer, whitelisting does not work, and I can't uninstall it on Chromebook. Believe me,I've searched the internet to find out how.

Switch to a network filter that supports third-party filters (and if you use block-by-default mode, white-list your own files). There are plenty to choose from: uBlock Origin, AdBlock/AdBlock Plus, etc. (I prefer uBlock Origin.)

So far so good. I will vote further down as I see questionable activity on my own registry, if I see anything wrong with making an account. I'm always very weary of apps and plugins that have you sign up so I used a mock email until I trust it enough to make a main one for it.

Latest update is very weird. I used to be able to allow sites to load clicking on the blue "play" Ghostery button. Not anymore!

Now licking on an ad link it goes into a white page with no options to whitelist only once. What happened?!!
-------------------------
list
The extension is beyond unusable now. Though the blocking and related things work with some performance slowdown compared to how it was before, they have REMOVED all export and import options and are forcing you to use their new account system to sync whitelisted sites and so on which DOES NOT WORK. Sites DO NOT SYNC and worse still, all whitelists you had previously are removed. Not to mention totally turning scummy and now collecting browsing and custom tracker info by default to sell to advertisers which you have to disable.

 It is utterly useless and I suggest you use ublock origin with their privacy lists.
-------------------------
list
It's broken. There's nothing in the status drop-down, it's completely blank. Every time I try to open "Options" it does a check, claims it's not installed and takes me to the Chrome Web Store where -- wait for it -- it tells me it's installed. Impossible to tell if it's actually *doing* anything: open a new web page and the sin-ugly purple box lists trackers but none of them are crossed-out. Totally b0rked. Don't know why I'm even bothering to keep it installed. Ver 7.0.x something on Chrome on Ubuntu.
-------------------------
list
I've used this app for ever and now uninstalled it after this horrific update.  It no longer quietly works in the background but has a continual PURPLE list along the right hand side of the screen, listing all the trackers that are blocked, and which continually fills in and shifts and piles up with every page you load or as you sit and browse. This not only blocks the entire side of each page but also PRINTS if you print anything.  There's no way to take this off the page unless you manually move your hand/cursor/mouse and "X" it down after which it pops right back up and is now part of your page/screen/Life. Since Google analytics is on every page, let alone 20-50 blocked trackers you will have this giant purple list on every page, always (I had over 100 on one site and have at times 8 tabs open if not 3 browsers) Ghostery is an intrusive mess of epic proportions now. There's no fast, temporary way to suspend the app like there used to be if you're on your banking site or somewhere they need to give you a Cookie, or you find you have to let them see who you are for that moment or are having a problem signing in on some shopping site and figure you'll just turn off your adblocker and Ghostery for a second and see if that's the issue (and it usually is).  This whole app has changed and is no longer usable, user friendly or QUIET.  It makes the whole comp jerky, makes websites lag and Chrome is running with so much RAM being used (yes, I tested it with and without..it IS Ghostery causing it) that it was just simpler (and sad) to get rid of it.  We also had to uninstall it at my office because we're trying to conference call and Skype and we have this GIANT PURPLE LIST popping up while we're showing each other stuff on the web we're researching.  It's now impossible to take screen shot because Ghostery is in the way of trying to browse and use your computer.  But hey! Why shouldn't they own you like every other app thinks they do out there?  Wrong. Ghostery --  Get it together and put the old version up again until you put out a better update.
-------------------------

It's a great extension, but... 

I was hoping that with the addition to the login option that my blocking settings would be saved. I use local computers often and it's a pain to have to whitelist sites I trust and unblock widgets and what not. It wastes time and time is money.
-------------------------

Ghostery has been a lifesaver for years, but alas, this update has utterly ruined it. When you click on your ghostery blue button, all I am getting is a HUGE white square that's completely blank. Nothing like the dropdown of before where I could whitelist a tracker for a site or disable/reenable trackers/the entire ghostery if i needed to check settings for various sites. The purple animation is very distracting and nearly impossible to read for someone with low vision like me. Guys, I loved you. You made dealing with site content so easy. But this? This is utterly unusable. Bye. Loved you truly.
-------------------------
list
New tracker list is an ugly purple and pops up even when there are no trackers, the Menu UI takes up way more space than it needs to, and there is no way to change these to something more tolerable (or tone down the excessive and distracting animations). Options that were previously available are gone without a trace. Sign-in is now required to access some features (that really shouldn't need it). For the cherry on top, it looks like they didn't QA test the new update properly and it's been bricked by "Unexpected Token" errors. I am giving them a month to fix this up, or I am switching all my clients to a competitor that actually knows what they are doing. Just stay away from this update and/or find something else if you were thinking about installing this.
-------------------------

I've been using Ghostery for a while now, and it's an useful extension. However, the last update changed the tracker list box into a horribly purple one. Which instantly turned the box from a useful feature into a nuisance. And, of course, there's no way to customize its appearance. 

Two stars just because of that.

Ghostery has been working fine up until a few days ago. I have to disable it to access Youtube and Facebook otherwise I just get an annoying  messed up HTML page. If the devs could fix this I'd really appreciate it.

I replied to a comment below that to fix the issue you had to remove the Ghostery then install it again. I'd like to clarify that this doesn't work for long, its still messing up Facebook and Youtube (and prob other sites I don't know about).

The only option you have is to either pause blocking or whitelist the websites. Which kind of defeats the purpose of this extension.

It's clean and simple but there are a LOT of popups, scripts and ads that are not blocked and it doesn't have the functionality to add custom or external filters. Some non-intrusive ads on facebook and yahoo appear to be whitelisted. I'm also very suspicios of the high ratings here, there are many better and non-proprietary extensions available.

It works OK but it still blocks Streak in Gmail even when mail.google.com is whitelisted! Whitelisting is NOT WORKING WELL!!!!

Ghostery gives the illusion of protecting your privacy. While it does block trackers, it is misleading because it sends info to the trackers anyway. PrismBreak has listed this addon as dangerous.

Can't say enough good things about  this. I absolutely hate the idea of and realities of tracking and targeting, so it's good fun to turn all those blue buttons to red !  The list of trackers on some sites is staggering--I got a count of 96  recently  on Stumbleupon.

The one incompatibility I found was for Google Blogger.  Some gadgets, such as the crucial 'Recent Posts' did not work unless the blog sites were whitelisted
-------------------------

Very easy to configure. It's shocking to see how many times we are tracked on so many websites so I am a little sceptical. How would we know? Just because it says, 10 trackers blocked. Have they actually been blocked? It's not as if we get a 'Who's been tracking you this month!' list delivered to us once a month.  So I've set it to block 100% of trackers found and will update this at the start of each browsing session on the presumption that, if this extension truly is preventing our browsing habits from being tracked, the 150-200+ junk emails I receive on a daily basis should decrease dramatically

Per PC Magazine, Ghostery tracks and sells the information to another data gathering monger! They fail to mention this in their details about this extension. I could not find this information anywhere else on their site either. No notice that they are tracking and passing our info onto another tracking service! What a scam! It looks like they are catching tons of trackers but then taking what they track and giving that info away? Bad form!
Also, it's not functioning as it is supposed to. I'm receiving an error now. It seemed to be working fine until recently. The error states it's not tracking...and mentions a list of trackers it's not tracking! What's up with this app and the appearance of web safety when in fact they are tracking us and passing on that information? What's the use?

Fantastic. Can sometimes mess up forms or online transactions so don't be scared of whitelisting sites or pausing the blocking if something isn't working right.

I highly recommend Ghostery. I'm a tad OCD and I researched and tried a lot of privacy extensions like NoScript, DoNotTrackMe and Disconnect before deciding that my fave was Ghostery. If you feel annoyed about all the companies and even stats-obsessed bloggers aggressively tracking you, this is a must-have extension (and if you're not that concerned about your privacy, your loss bc a tracker+cookie can reveal A LOT about you). Subscribing to EasyPrivacy List or Fanboy Annoyances/Social List through ABP is not enough. You need an extension to be able to block everything and control what you block. Ghostie blocks pretty much everything for me (though I feel like it works even better in Firefox) and I can allow certain widgets I use frequently, like disqus and soundcloud, and whitelist certain sites I trust. I would recommend you turn off the alert bubble and choose "block new elements by default". If Ghostery blocks too much stuff for you, just toggle off blocking on widgets. Overall, great, easy-to-use extension.

I love the idea, but this is not the tool for me. It slowed by browser down and made me take extra steps to view content on too many websites. I basically ended up pausing blocking or whitelisting too made sites just to be able to see the content that this hid. Missing content included reviews on some sites, pictures or products on some sites (Nordstrom) and video from many sites. I am unintalling the program.

I truly feel that extensions such as this, could take the place of traditional anti-spyware applications. Anti-spyware programs are pointless if you keep letting the scripts in the gate, with a wide-open browser. Ghostery is the gateway. I just wish it had a export/import feature for the white-list...
-------------------------
whitelist
Would have gotten 5 stars if it would have had profiles (eg "allow facebook connect", "allow "disqus") and whitelisting a site towards those profiles.

Reason: Normally I do not want these trackers on but for some sites I always want them on. But just some selected trackers, hence not a whitelisting of the site... This results in a lot of enabling / disabling some trackers.  

The lack of this feature plus the lack of a "dismiss bubble button" in the bubble popup only gives it a 4. Otherwise it is a must have plug/extension.
-------------------------
list
Ghostery for Firefox is much better.  In Firefox, when I press the Ghostery icon, Ghostery tells you whether the tracker is advertising, tracker or widget (though it doesn't group them).  When you press the Ghostery icon in Chrome, it lists all the trackers (grouped by company) without specifying whether it's advertising, widgets or a tracker.  I've been blocking most trackers and advertising in Firefox.  If you can do this in the Chrome Ghostery, it isn't very intuitive.  I still like it though.
-------------------------

Since installing Ghostery I have a "ad info" header that gets open on my Facebook and it starts adding blank lines to certain FB posts. Very irritating. there are 3 on my Facebook and take up more than one page of space each. 
I clicked on the "ad Info and it goes to "open app Media" with a list of instructions on how to delete you completely but  I don't use "apps" in any way with this computer!

How do I fix this??

A+, works as advised, super-safe, a must-have extension. The only downside is that very few sites do not work as expected, but you can always whitelist them (:
-------------------------

It would be nice if the descriptions also listed the sites that the tracker came from and those it is going to affect if blocked. In addition it would be nice if there were a place to type in a site you are having trouble with to see if it has been reported to cause a problem and what one should unblock to use it.In a perfect world if a block were to cause a problem,a pop-up would tell us what we would need to unblock in order to use.Thank-you an eye-opener.

While it's a useful plugin, it could make it easier to extract the URLs or domains to permit easier adding into Adblock. At the moment I can select the domain in the drop-down from the icon, press ctrl-c then manually add a filter into adblock. Ideally Ghostery would permit blocking of individual web-bugs and permit editing of the blocked URLs.

I'd like the blocking lists separated into categories like Firefox. I don't need to block ads because I already have Adblock Plus.

Enabling the Ghostery extension but whitelisting the site blocks the file picker dialog from opening. I'm wondering if it's related to the accept type of the <input>, but I have not strong leads.

Ghostery is an extension that operates from within your browser. If you'd like to remove or uninstall Gho, open your browser and remove it from the browser's add-ons or extensions page. For example: In Chrome or Chromium or any derivative extensions are listed at URL chrome://extensions/

Your extension is amazing but there is one problem. Sometimes in a website, image links don't work. When you press on them nothing happens. If you open the same sit on Internet Explorer, the links work fine. For example, on t-mobile.com, when I open a phone up, I can't scroll through the images of the phone when I click on the arrow button. The only fix I found was white listing these websites, but that is a minor annoyance that I have to do it for every site, and it defeats the purpose of using this wonderful extension. Thank you, hopefully this report has enough info about the problem I am facing!

I have a couple of web apps that run locally. These are reporting back to Google Analytics. I don't want to block Google Analytics, but also do not want my local usage reported. What I would need is a "Blacklist" - block everything on this page/domain, i.e. block "localhost", etc.

First i have to put that Ghostery is one of the best "Ad SPAM Blocker" i have used.

I only use Ghostery on sites that bombard me with Ads that take more time to load Ads than the content i am looking for.

The main reason i am only give 4 stars out of 5 is because there use to be advance settings for adjusting which Ad to block or allow for Ghostery that were easy to use but now there is a watered down in setting that only allows me to use default or block.

And because i cannot customize these some sites are breaking, mostly on sites comments.

*Update* Few minutes after posting this, I sill wanted to mess with Ghostery and i was able to fix the comment issue. I tested it with a few sites and it is working for me. 

I had to disable the Enhanced Ad Blocking *Which is the shield button* and only in detailed display disable what I don't want to see.

So now 4 out of 5 until Enhanced Ad Blocking is improved.
-------------------------
default
Should automatically add new cookies and other objects to the filter, instead you have to manually add them yourself.

They have a number of bugs that are breaking the ability to view high profile websites.

Now it just auto disables everything on update instead of forcing you to manually add new trackers. I get that it wants to allow websites to function but this is dishonest. I don't care if it's open source, your designing default behavior to be disingenuous and counter intuitive. Fix your product and stop making excuses about why you aren't communicating terrible functionality changes. That or stop making the terrible changes to begin with and you won't see as much backlash.
-------------------------

Some may take issue with Ghostery's advertisement links but if you can look past that it does the job perfectly and doesn't force you into anything - the worrying options are off by default.
-------------------------

I've used ghostery for years and use to recommend it as a must have extension. But recently I've had to fight it to actually do its job and block trackers. They seem to now default to unblocked, the signing in sucks, the new owners are ruining a great program
-------------------------
default
I installed it and ran it in its default one-click setting. I tested it on some privacy sites like Electronic Frontier Organization's Panopticlick. It passed in "blocking tracking ads" and "stop trackers included in the so-called acceptable whitelist ads" but failed in "blocking invisible trackers" and in "unblock third parties that promise to honor do not track." 

It didn't pass fingerprinting, but I am still looking for something that will pass that test.
-------------------------
default
Mostly does what it's supposed to, apart from the shady practice of installing its own tracker if you're not careful enough to uncheck the box. By default it also places a giant purple box on top of the webpage. Such intrusive behavior should never be the default setting for an extension meant to run in the background only.
-------------------------
default
Ghostery used to be the first thing that I installed on new PC.  But things seem to be going downhill.   The UI became more complex and some defaults are favor for ad companies Or it's easy to click on such option if you are not careful. I suspect there were pressures from ad companies.  I'll find something else.
-------------------------
default
The extension is beyond unusable now. Though the blocking and related things work with some performance slowdown compared to how it was before, they have REMOVED all export and import options and are forcing you to use their new account system to sync whitelisted sites and so on which DOES NOT WORK. Sites DO NOT SYNC and worse still, all whitelists you had previously are removed. Not to mention totally turning scummy and now collecting browsing and custom tracker info by default to sell to advertisers which you have to disable.

 It is utterly useless and I suggest you use ublock origin with their privacy lists.

Update 9.8.16
Changing to one star, how do I revert back this update, cant do anything

I discovered this tool working on web performance projects, and now I tell everyone I meet to download and use it immediately, not for privacy concerns, but mainly for making the web 30% faster. For the major enterprise websites I look at, the combined third party analytics tracking pixels and calls contributes to 30% of the end to end download time in browser sessions. Given this realization, I wouldnt be surprised if the analytics industry is fighting tooth and nail to prevent a plugin like this from becoming a default feature of newer browser updates. Get ready for popups on your favorite site saying "please disable blocking tools to access our content"
-------------------------

This is for more than just the paranoid. It helps protect your privacy, which is a reasonable thing to expect. I set it to block everything by default, and only enable something in specific cases (like chat boxes) on sites when it is my choice.

Excellent function, but setup could have better defaults out of the box.
-------------------------

It's a good blocker, but they sell the data to the companies you're trying to avoid when you're subscribed to ghostrank (which is on by default).  Just on that principle, I use Disconnect, which is a lot better anyway (doesn't break sites etc.) I'd suggest everybody move to Disconnect as it does the same things, as well as encrypting your connections when available (which Ghostery doesn't do). And they don't sell or store any data on you.

If you decide to use this extension instead of Disconnect, MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF GHOSTRANK if you don't want your browsing data sold to the same advertisement companies you're trying to avoid.
-------------------------
config
It seems like every time I boot up my computer the Ghostery configuration page pops up. What's with that?  

I have had a lot of problems with the cursor jumping around the page and with certain sites when I clicked 'like' (not Facebook) the view would jump to the top. I tested all the extensions and it's definitely Ghostery. That and the config page popping up all the time and the fact the whole thing breaks regularly is a deal breaker for me. Shame because like the little girl, when it was good, it was very very good, but now it is bad, it is horrid.

If I have Ghostery enabled, the maximize button on the right corner just does not work, nothing happens when I click it, even if Netflix is set as trusted and technically Ghostery disabled on the website.

when "enhanced anti-tracking" option is enabled, youtube doesn't save settings like theme or localization and drops it to default state each time you leave the site and then return back, even when 'trust site' option is checked. when "enhanced anti-tracking" option is turned off everything works fine and every setting is saved as expected.

I've had it a year but recently its started causing problems. Pages hang for ages and fail to load. The message at the foot of the page says "Waiting for Ghostery.."

I've used Ghostery for years but will no longer.
The newest update, even when websites are marked trusted, ghostery would disable crucial javascript for uploading content via file explorer to any website.
An example is if you go to imgur and go to upload a file and click the browse button to what's supposed to open a file explorer window to all you to select the file(s) you wish to upload. After spending considerable time troubleshooting, I discovered the Ghostery extension was causing the Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT Console errors preventing the javascript opening a window to upload files. This mind you, was for ANY button on ANY website (I tested everything from major websites to edu websites). I mean.. I didn't have to once I discovered the issue was Ghostery but before that when troubleshooting I did. I will never use Ghostery again for Google Chrome... and with features Chrome has added you don't need to anymore.. so really neither should anyone else. Again, even with a website marked as trusted (which I doubled checked again with Ghostery re-installed) Ghostery still preventing this safe and normal javascripts from loading which enable the ability to upload files via a file browser window.

I configured - "Block everything" with the initial configuration screen. However, it isn't proving effective against the menace of Auto-playing Videos still !? Check for instance - https://www.news18.com/news/india/learn-from-china-who-tells-india-after-another-poor-showing-on-pollution-index-1735501.html.

As you scroll down the page, the embedded Video starts playing all of a sudden & that too without our consent!

 Secondly, the left click on the Ghostery icon isn't showcasing the "About" option anywhere to catch hold of the current version no. instantly!

The current version must go mentioned at the Top of its tiny interface - which  opens up when left mouse click is pressed against its icon on the toolbar.

Thank you.

TERRIBLY slow extension which dramatically slows the load time for all my sites, getting a "Waiting for Ghostery" message in the status bar all the time. Even on Trusted sites. This should NOT be. If not for this, I would have given at least 4/5. Please fix!

Furthermore, this extension fails to actually prevent the download of blocked JavaScript. Preventing JavaScript from running is something Chrome can do by itself. I was to flat out deny the scripts from even being downloaded to my machine.

I've used this since around 2018 but the quality of this extension has slowly slipped ever further with every update.

The massive memory leak that it's suffered under for who knows how long has never been solved and the ticket/issue about it on the github still holds true, if you use task manager inside chrome after having ghostery active for an hour you may be surprised at how many gbs it ravenously hogs. 

Add onto the matter that it has been constantly bringing up pop ups about rewards, offers, and other nonsense.

It's practically become an ad software in it's own right along with how it almost methodically slows down your browser over time, with my end guess for such an oddity being the data that it collects on the user for unknown purposes.

It is quite sad that such a previously shining extension has slipped so far, bring back the ghostery of 2018 please, as with an i5 6600k, 16gb of ddr4 ram, a ssd, and only four tabs opened ghostery somehow has managed to drag even a fresh install of chrome to a crawl.

Also whittled down my extensions to figure out that Ghostery was also causing issues with general browser performance. Videos were no longer able to go fullscreen, and ctrl+clicking on links would try to bring a link up in a new window instead of a new tab.

It's a good plugin for blocking scripts, 3rd party web stuff, beacons, trackers and the likes, easy to use though I started to find the changes to the UI were a bit unnecessary.

I love ghostery, it does a great job but have found lately that it slows page load by quite a bit. I disabled it which made pages load much quicker but the downside was ALL THOSE FLAMING ADS!!!!

"Bernardo ReisModified 5 days ago

Like previous posters David and Peter, I've also been having issues after Ghostery's update to version 8.0.0.34. Some websites simply won't load unless Ghostery is paused (or even disabled). For several times now, a random page seems to originate the problem -
keeps loading indefinitely - and soon after every other browser tab becomes unresponsive. 
I've been a long time Ghostery user and would like to thank you for all your hard work over the years, but I've recently had to stop using ghostery as it's become too much of a hassle. As David Friedman pointed out, there isn't much use to it if it has to be continuously disabled to access content.
Hope you guys can figure this out soon! Thanks!

Present rating is for version 8.0.0.34, otherwise would rate it 5**"

As you must stay informed about the information you are freely giving out.

Protect your cookies, browsing tendencies and block the offending trackers.

Takes a bit to set up in going through the different websites. 

Being honest there are a few sites that I simply won't visit due to all of the trackers that must be allowed to view their sites. 

>>The bad thing<< 
There were a several sites where I was (past tense) a paid user. And those sites wanted more from me than my monthly subscription. All five sites had the most trackers giving/selling my personal information.

I HAVE USED GHOSTERY 8 YEARS ON MANY COMPUTERS.
IT IS ALWAYS MY FIRST INSTALL AFTER I ADD MY SECURITY SUITE AND BROWSERS TO A NEW COMPUTER.

I AM SORRY THAT SOME PEOPLE GIVE GHOSTERY A BAD REVIEW. JUST LOOK FOR THE LITTLE GHOST ICON NEAR THE TOP OF THE BROWSER TO CONFIGURE IT. THAT SIMPLE.
-------------------------
browser
I've used this app for ever and now uninstalled it after this horrific update.  It no longer quietly works in the background but has a continual PURPLE list along the right hand side of the screen, listing all the trackers that are blocked, and which continually fills in and shifts and piles up with every page you load or as you sit and browse. This not only blocks the entire side of each page but also PRINTS if you print anything.  There's no way to take this off the page unless you manually move your hand/cursor/mouse and "X" it down after which it pops right back up and is now part of your page/screen/Life. Since Google analytics is on every page, let alone 20-50 blocked trackers you will have this giant purple list on every page, always (I had over 100 on one site and have at times 8 tabs open if not 3 browsers) Ghostery is an intrusive mess of epic proportions now. There's no fast, temporary way to suspend the app like there used to be if you're on your banking site or somewhere they need to give you a Cookie, or you find you have to let them see who you are for that moment or are having a problem signing in on some shopping site and figure you'll just turn off your adblocker and Ghostery for a second and see if that's the issue (and it usually is).  This whole app has changed and is no longer usable, user friendly or QUIET.  It makes the whole comp jerky, makes websites lag and Chrome is running with so much RAM being used (yes, I tested it with and without..it IS Ghostery causing it) that it was just simpler (and sad) to get rid of it.  We also had to uninstall it at my office because we're trying to conference call and Skype and we have this GIANT PURPLE LIST popping up while we're showing each other stuff on the web we're researching.  It's now impossible to take screen shot because Ghostery is in the way of trying to browse and use your computer.  But hey! Why shouldn't they own you like every other app thinks they do out there?  Wrong. Ghostery --  Get it together and put the old version up again until you put out a better update.

Update 9.8.16
Changing to one star, how do I revert back this update, cant do anything

I discovered this tool working on web performance projects, and now I tell everyone I meet to download and use it immediately, not for privacy concerns, but mainly for making the web 30% faster. For the major enterprise websites I look at, the combined third party analytics tracking pixels and calls contributes to 30% of the end to end download time in browser sessions. Given this realization, I wouldnt be surprised if the analytics industry is fighting tooth and nail to prevent a plugin like this from becoming a default feature of newer browser updates. Get ready for popups on your favorite site saying "please disable blocking tools to access our content"
-------------------------

Used this in another browser and got very used to it just blocking all the crap. Thanks!
-------------------------
browser
Too high maintenance and naggy with opening tabs each time I start a new browser session.
-------------------------
browser
I knew a there were a lot of trackers on nearly every website but wow, some really go overboard. Clogging my PC and slowing my browser with needless junk. Ghostery helps keep that under control. I rarely come across a site that is impacted by Ghostery. Thanks!

IT SEEMS THAT FOR ALL OF YOU HAVING THIS THING, UBLOCK, THAT IT'S A "REDIRECTING" BROWSER TAKEOVER MALWARE?   I'VE HAD BEFORE, WITH CHROME SEEMING SUSCEPTIBLE  TO THESE,  AND THE ONLY GREAT REMOVAL TOOL,  "FREE"  LIKE GHOSTERY,  IS THE FABULOUS 
'ADWARE CLEANER",   COMBINED WITH MALWARE BYTES,  FREE AS WELL
FOR A TIME,  AS IS THE FABULOUS,  ADBLOCK CLEANER,  FOR AD BLOCKING,  YET  THE ONLY THING,  NOT WINDOWS, MCAFEE, CHROME, NORTON,  NOTHING,  THAT  WARNED ME OF  THESE COMPLETE TAKEOVER MALWARE  BROWSERS,  AND WORSE.    HAVING MY BRAND NEW LENOVO DESKTOP FOR 3 DAYS,   SEEMING TO WORK FINE BUT WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO LOAD  MY MCAFEE ANTI-VIRUS/TROJAN,   MALWARE, PROGRAM.
EVEN AS THE INCOMPETENT,  LAZY,  SUPPOSED TECH EXPERT AT COX COMMUNICATIONS,   MY CABLE TV, INTERNET PROVIDER  THAT COMES WITH MCAFEE,  SO PATRONIZINGLY,  UNABLE TO LOAD THIS HERSELF,  WITH MY HAVING TOLD HER THAT MAYBE WAS MALWARE PREVENTING THIS,  DIDN'T RUN A SINGLE MALWARE SCAN,  HAVING ASSURED ME THAT SHE PER THEIR  ASSURANCE PROGRAM,  WOULD HAVE IT LOADED IN 72 HOURS, THEN CALL ME BACK.    PART OF THIS I PRESUMED,  WOULD INVOLVE A  MAJOR TROJAN, ANTIVIRUS SCAN,  AS HER OWN WEBSITE SPEAKS TO VIRUSES, TROJANS, PREVENTING LOADING, RUNNING,  THESE PROGRAMS.   NORMALLY COX WOULD JUST SEND US TO MCAFEE, OR HAVE US CALL THEM DIRECTLY FOR THIS,  A COMMON GLITCH AS WELL WITH COX'ES  SITE LOADING IT.  BUT  NO,  THIS PATRONIZING,  WOMAN WHO WOULDN'T GIVE ME HER NAME,  JUST THE INITIAL "C",  NO EMPLOYEE  NUMBER,  A TELLTALE SIGN OF A SCREW UP,  LAZY,  CHEAT,  HAVING  BEEN REPORTED FOR  BEING SO TO THE BOSSES,  TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD HAVE THIS LOADED IN THEIR 72 HOUR  TIME LIMIT.   AS  I NEVER HEARD FROM HER,  CALLED, LEFT MESSAGES,  EVEN HEARING HER LAUGHING IN THE BACKGROUND.   YET LO AND BEHOLD,  MCAFEE  WAS WORKING,  SO I THOUGHT, ON THE FOURTH DAY!    AS I STILL AWAITED  HER CALL BACK TO GIVE ME THE FINAL PASSWORD SHE HAD USED  TO SET THIS UP.    MCAFEE  WAS RUNNING  THE REAL TIME SCANNING,   ALL MY SETTINGS, ALERT  NOTIFICATIONS  WERE SET TO MAX SAFETY,   WHERE IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,  THE FIREWALL IS TURNED OFF TO ALLOW A NEW PROGRAM THROUGH, WHATEVER, THEY SENT US INCESSANT POP UPS SAYING OUR SYSTEM ISN'T PROTECTED.  I EVEN  RAN A DEEP SCAN OVERNIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING  WAS LURKING ON THIS NEW COMPUTER,  OVERNIGHT,  THAN CAME OUT CLEAN.  THOUGH I STRANGELY HAD A 5 SECOND POP UP FROM LENOVO, CUT OFF,  JUST AS I WAS UNABLE TO LOAD MY NEW OFFICE PROGRAM!  TO BE SURE,  I RAN ANOTHER DEEP SCAN,  THOUGH OTHERWISE,  AL  LOOKED  FINE.  STILL NEVER HEARING FROM "C",  CALLING HER TO AGAIN HEAR HER LAUGHING  FROM  THE TECH POOL IT SEEMED.   BUT DAY 3, POST ANOTHE NORMAL DEEP SCAN BY MCAFEE,  I HAD THOUSANDS OF AD POP UPS COVERING THE SCREEN, UNABLE TO GET TO ANY PROGRAM,  OR MCAFEE,  AND  NOT A WARNING FROM ANY OF THESE SUPPOSED  SECURITY EXPERTS,  WINDOWS, CHROM, MCAFEE,  OF ANYTHING TRYING TO INVADE MY SYSTEM, CHANGE PROGRAMS.  BUT FOR BLESS  THEM, I RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE,  ANOTHER FREE MUST HAVE LIKE GHOSTERY,  ADBLOCK PLUS,  A  COLABORATOR WITH THE FREE MALWARE BYTES,  ADWARE CLEANER,  THE BEST SECURITY,  MALWARE CLEANERS THERE ARE.  I GOT HUNDREDS OF POP UPS IN BETWEEN  THESE OTHERS,  FIGHTING THROUGH  THEM,  WITH NOTICE POP UPS FROM THE ALSO FANTASTIC, MAX REISSLER, ON GOOGLE PLUS,  ANOTHER NO CHARGE, MALWARE EXPERT, RESEARCHER,  TELLING ME THAT MY BROWSER WAS TAKEN OVER BY A TROJAN AS WELL!!
SOMEHOW I UNINSTALLED ONE OF THESE MALWARE, AD PRODUCERS, 'SIGNAL STRONG', JUST LONG ENOUGH TO CHECK MY SYSTEM, SHOCKED TO SEE THAT WINDOWS EVERYTHING HAD BEEN UNINSTALLED, BY A NEW "USER",  NAMED 'GROWSMART"M,  THAT REINSTALLED IT'S OWN  SO  EXACT VERSIONS OF WINDOWS, CHROME, EVEN OF MCAFEE  SUPPOSEDLY RUNNING  REAL TIME AND DEEP SCANS!  I WOULD NEVER HAD KNOWN  IF NOT FOR ADBLOCK PLUS,  MAX REISLER OF ADWARE CLEANER, FOR FREE, SENDING ME THE NONSTOP POP UPS  TELLING ME  OF  THIS  NIGHTMARE
OF WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE MOST HORRIFIC  "ARTISAN" TROJAN!  THAT NOT ONE OF THESE OTHER PROGRAMS, I HAD FOR DECADES,  10 YEARS,  NOTIFIED ME OF THESE ALL BEING REMOVED!

I'm concerned with a new feature.

The CMP will allow us to message our users directly in their browser with product announcements, promotions, and other appropriate notifications.  This  messaging system and can be turned off at any time by accessing the advanced tab of the options menu.

There isn't a good explanation exactly how they plan to use this, but it could certainly be abused.  To their credit you can disable it.
-------------------------
browser
Brilliant app! Doesn't affect the speed of the Chrome Browser and identifies and blocks tracking and targeting by third (or fourth) party agents. This should be a standard feature built into Chrome!
-------------------------
browser
It crashes your browsers.
-------------------------
browser
It actually makes my browser faster by blocking the trackers!
-------------------------
browser
I've been using it for years now, but oddly enough didn't decide to comment until now lol... I would rate 5 stars, but for some sites, even putting it on pause, or turning it off still doesn't allow some legit sites to load. Bottomline when used with an ad blocking extension it gives us an extra layer of protection but with the ad blocker and Ghostery running at the same time even on a 64b browser it can slow loading time of pages by up to 15 seconds of staring at a blank white page while it loads.
-------------------------
browser
I DO NOT NEED GHOSTERY OPENING A LANDING PAGE EVERYTIME I START MY BROWSER. BAD FEATURE,  HOW DO I SHUT IT OFF??
-------------------------
browser
used to be brilliant but lately causes more problems than it solves. Slowed my browser down to the point where it had to go. Shame
-------------------------
browser
Amazing extension! been using it for like a year already and now I remember to rate it XD it minimized so much of the spyware cookies that intrude on my comp, I checked with SUPER ANTI SPYWARE and results are sup compares to using browser without this extension and adblock.
-------------------------
browser
Makes it so much easier not to have to type the names of the trackers in browsers. Makes Computer run Faster.  I like Know who is snooping in my biz.
-------------------------
browser
Works well. Now if I could only get it to stop showing the tab at startup that has all the open tabs on it I would be overjoyed. Very redundant as the open tabs are already open and showing in my browser. Nitpicking but its annoying
-------------------------
browser
This and Adblock+ are must-have extensions for any browser, can't recommend them enough.
-------------------------
browser
The first extension I install after I start a clean browser.
-------------------------
browser
While I like what this extension is about, I had to uninstall it after I finally realized it's been the cause of my problems. I have a Chromebook and Ghostery would literally cut my wifi speed in half and bog my system down. Since I've removed it, my connection is back up to 125 mbs on wifi and the browser is much, much faster now. What a shame...
-------------------------
browser
I love the idea, but this is not the tool for me. It slowed by browser down and made me take extra steps to view content on too many websites. I basically ended up pausing blocking or whitelisting too made sites just to be able to see the content that this hid. Missing content included reviews on some sites, pictures or products on some sites (Nordstrom) and video from many sites. I am unintalling the program.

Pop-up notification bubbles and the hard-headed dev who won't stop them

Ghostery is a good product that does what it claims it will do; and does it with aplomb.  And so I give it five stars for that, at least, since that's the most important thing.

However, there's also something about it that makes me furious; and I think anyone who's thinking of using Ghostery should know about it.  So here it is...

I keep writing to the dev and telling him to stop popping-up notification bubbles in the upper-right corner of my browser. He keep writing back and telling me how to go into settings and turn them off, which, of course, I do. I'm not stupid; I've been an IT pro for pushing 40 years and I'm pretty sure I know how to configure an app.

The problem is, and has always been, that the app, even after I've turned-off all pop-up notification bubbles, nevertheless still pops-up such bubbles at least to notify me of that the database has been updated; or that there's been some other kind of update.

I don't want to see those kinds of bubbles, either; and there seems no way to turn them off in the app's settings. And the dev seems to think it's okay to interrupt people's work in their browsers with such notifications.

Certain app developers just insist on their apps being the center of everything. They don't seem to get that their app is just one app of many on most people's computers, and all computer users just want their apps to work, and be quiet about it.

Devs of Chrome plugins/extensions who pop-open a whole new tab to announce that their app has just updated are the worst offenders, of course. Abine's DO-NOT-TRACK-ME did that yesterday, and nearly froze my browser right in the middle of my typing something that was on a deadline. I was so angry I almost screamed out loud.

What Ghostery does, with the pop-up bubble notifications of updates are almost as bad; and no amount of complaining about it, and describing it seems to get through the thick skull of its developer, who insists that as long as I've turned-off all notifications in the app's settings, then I shouldn't be seeing any bubbles.

One time one of said bubbles popped-up to tell me that Ghostery's database had updated literally while I was reading his email insisting that I must not have configured the app properly.

Ghostery's dev, then, is, in my opinion, an awful kind of intransigent bully who's incapable of taking the necessary giant step back from himself and his work to honestly ask himself if someone else could possibly be right.

Shame on him. Persons considering using Ghostery should make sure their eyes are wide open about the kind of person is its dev.

One of my favorite extentions, I use more than one web browser, and I use this extention on each one of them, along with Adblock Plus
-------------------------

I truly feel that extensions such as this, could take the place of traditional anti-spyware applications. Anti-spyware programs are pointless if you keep letting the scripts in the gate, with a wide-open browser. Ghostery is the gateway. I just wish it had a export/import feature for the white-list...

Thank you kindly for this exorcism of spam from my browser.

Great blocking app, catching more trackers than "do not track me" did. BUT it REALLY slows down Chrome, particularly it seems after the browser has been open for a few hours.

I know the slowdown is due to Ghostery because a message appears at the bottom of the browser saying it's waiting for Ghostery. :-(  Very frustrating.
-------------------------
browser
Great, except for one (browser related) problem: Ghostery for Chrome doesn't block as much as Firefox (cookies etc.), but this is because Chrome doesn't have the appropriate APIs. If you want more control (and less speed), use Firefox.
-------------------------
browser
This is a must for real privacy if you are willing to spend some time refining it a little as you browse so the sites you need to work (and which sacrifice your privacy) are given some leeway. With this, you decide who, where, when, and why any site (or any snooping corporation) gets access to data on your system or gets to track you everywhere you go.

Do not trust that your browser alone can protect you, especially if you are using Chrome, Safari, or IE. Get this now and then add HTTPS Everywhere as well.
-------------------------
browser
This little bitty extension in my Chrome browser has done exactly what I had hoped it would do. If I could rate it higher than 5 stars I would. It has shown me exactly how my browsing is being tracked, it blocks the sites I choose while allowing access to the sites I want.

Good afternoon. I don't know what's happened, but as of today the Ghostery browser extension has just stopped working for me. I didn't have this problem last night, but as of booting up this afternoon I've had ads everywhere. First caught it on YouTube when I suddenly got ads on videos. I can't click on Ghostery in the extensions section at the top of chrome either, it just doesn't open.

I am suffering a memory leak with the ghostery extension. After running my browser for 12 hours, I checked memory usage this morning and ghostery was using at least 256 megabytes. Just now I checked again after running it for about 10 hours, and it was using at least 500 megabytes.

If I have Ghostery enabled, the maximize button on the right corner just does not work, nothing happens when I click it, even if Netflix is set as trusted and technically Ghostery disabled on the website.

Clicking on YouTube full-screen button in up-to-date Chrome browser on Windows 10 Pro 64 bit results in error message. "f" shortcut still works. Disabling Ghostery extension works.

Ghostery is an extension that operates from within your browser. If you'd like to remove or uninstall Gho, open your browser and remove it from the browser's add-ons or extensions page. For example: In Chrome or Chromium or any derivative extensions are listed at URL chrome://extensions/
-------------------------
browser
It depends the browser you use. I here explain for chrome.Click the button (three bands) in the top right corner (to chose options in browser settings). Then click 'settings'. Then in the new page chose 'Extensions'. If you already installed 'Ghostery' its icon will be displayed (looking blue colored if already installed or in grey colored if already disabled) along with other add ons. In the right side you can see a check box, which will let you enable or disable this add on. The option is yours.

When reporting an issue, you should provide: browser version, operating system, & error message at the very least.

As to Ghostery (v. 5.4.2) my browser Google Chrome (v. 41.0.2272.89 m) is reporting the following as a continuing issue: This extension can not redirect a network request to data:application/javascript;base64,dmFy[...]H19 because another extension (Disconnect) has redirected the request to about: blank. I wrote to Disconnect (installed is v. 5.18.19) about this issue, and this was their answer: Unfortunately, Ghostery changed their extension away from the standard redirect that all the other Chrome blocking extensions use - there's nothing we can do about it without breaking compatibility with some much larger extensions (namely Adblock). You might consider writing to them.

It results worldwide in a use amount of extra energy consumed, we are talking about the size of several powerplants) Bigger problem is that both browsers are crashing a lot.

Used this extension for about 3 years. Today, they decided users would want to see how many trackers are on each website in search engine results, like google for example. In what world would the average user want to see an obtrusive icon to tell them this information. Just because you have the data doesn't mean the average user cares about that data specifically. Imagine other extensions that a user has also being this obnoxious. It doesn't scale well. Please make it a toggle option or remove it. Because I've used this for so long, holding off on uninstalling for a week or so to see if this will be corrected.
-------------------------
data
I've used this since around 2018 but the quality of this extension has slowly slipped ever further with every update.

The massive memory leak that it's suffered under for who knows how long has never been solved and the ticket/issue about it on the github still holds true, if you use task manager inside chrome after having ghostery active for an hour you may be surprised at how many gbs it ravenously hogs. 

Add onto the matter that it has been constantly bringing up pop ups about rewards, offers, and other nonsense.

It's practically become an ad software in it's own right along with how it almost methodically slows down your browser over time, with my end guess for such an oddity being the data that it collects on the user for unknown purposes.

It is quite sad that such a previously shining extension has slipped so far, bring back the ghostery of 2018 please, as with an i5 6600k, 16gb of ddr4 ram, a ssd, and only four tabs opened ghostery somehow has managed to drag even a fresh install of chrome to a crawl.

To my surprise I often see Ghostery recommended even though it's notorious for being anything but private. I decided to try recently anyway out of curiosity. It performs well-enough but a there is a rogue ad here and there, even Youtube ads on occasion begin loading (but the ad does not start). Given the fact Ghostery is harvesting your private data for profit it seems ridiculous to bother with it because free, open-source ad blockers like uBlock Origin and AdGuard perform even better. Ghostery is predatory too. At install it motioned me towards downloading a Ghostery spyware suite; including a 'free' VPN! A lot of people will fall prey and unknowingly lose their right to privacy. Way to go Ghostery!

I was using Ghostery when David Cancel was the primary developer. I was concerned when it was taken over by The Better Advertising Project, due to the company publicly admitting it was working with advertisers.

A massive positive during this period is that I worked with one of their representatives, over Firefox's addon forum and through email, to address problems in their Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. The person was responsive and the company made positive changes to their policies.

Fast forward to 2019 and all that I can say is: Wow. I'm surprised that people still use this extension/addon. Has anybody actually read the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use that Cliqz provides for their services? Has anybody thought about the amount of pure trust put into using something like this?

Can Cliqz intercept your personally identifiable information before it enters their proxy network, called The Human Web? Is it technically possible and the company just asks you to trust them that your information is never collected?

When it inserts ads into your browsing experience, how does it know what ads to give you? The ads would be ineffective if improperly administered, e.g., as a male, I would not respond to female product ads.

There are financial reasons that this product has been bought and sold a few times and it's certainly not because the developers want to completely protect the user. Personal data profiles and data sets are extremely valuable in today's market and Ghostery is one way to get that information.

Ghostery might have been a good idea, but it seems as if David Cancel developed it specifically to get investment dollars with the express goal to sell the products (your and my data).
-------------------------
data
Normally, for extra protection when surfing the web, a user might turn to incognito mode. But in incognito mode only ensures that your browsing history is not stored on your computer, but the data still trickles out to these third parties like google or facebook. Can this add-on stop those third parties from having our data ?

Thank you for this useful information.

I just read that Google pays Ad blocking companies 30% of their additional revenues to allow ads. I wanted to find out if Ghostery accepts payments to unblock ads. I can't tell that, but if it was bought by an advertising company, it's obvious they are accepting payments and probably collecting user data to inject ads.

Today is my last day with them.
-------------------------
data
Ghostery sells data only if you opt into it. You can opt out by going to Ghostery>The 3 dots>Settings>Opt in/out and unchecking whatever you don't want to share with them.
-------------------------
data
Ghostery disables tracker blocking every update. You have to re-enable trackers every update and work through Ghostery's ridiculous attempts to get you to sign in so *they* can track and sell your data.
-------------------------
data
Ghostery is open source and we do not track personal data. You can view us on Github: https://github.com/ghostery/ghostery-extension
-------------------------
data
They are owned by an advertising company, they leak private user data in emails. Don't trust it. Use Privacy Badger instead
-------------------------
data
Ghostery has started collecting data on your browsing and certificates have not been renewed so they are further a security risk.

I keep getting a warning under this saying "This extension failed to redirect data"

Highly annoying that the app is logged out, does not remember the login. 

After using it for a few days, realise it is not logged in and all my changes were lost.

Reporting this to the developers does nothing, there is no response.

Ghostery will continue to scrape the page & connection for data after Trusting a site. hmmm :/ not good.
-------------------------
data
You misunderstood what happened...you are misunderstanding how Ghostery works. The page you must have accidentally navigated to was merely displaying one of Ghostery's products (which, yes, it SELLS,) which is not something that is even marketed toward average consumers like you or me. Those "products" are available for commercial purposes to those interested in paying for the service (which actually just shows customers the very data that Ghostery collects as it cleans the web for us -- don't get scared by the word 'data collection,' either...it is harmless and we actually have the choice to opt into it to support Ghostery.) 
Ghostery, the extension, is ENTIRELY free -- it does not even have the option to pay for some extra "advanced" version. Every feature is available for free. You DO NOT need to make an account. :)
-------------------------
data
It has to sync up some of your data with the "home" server (the tracking data that it collects), so extension depends on the server. Just wait and see if they sort things out, or switch to another extension. There are many that collect less data or do not collect any data at all:
1. Adblock Plus makes money through "Acceptable ads" program (collecting money from the ad networks for letting through some non-intrusive ads),
2. uBlock Origin (not uBlock -- that is not updated) is entirely non-commercial and "no donations accepted" and does not have "home" server entirely.
3. Other blockers I do not know about.
-------------------------
data
I've been using it for years on Chrome. Recently found out that Ghostery keeps itself free by doing data collection on our browsing habits then sells it to other companies. I do not, and will not, support companies that do data collection of any kind on users.

Here is a Lifehacker article that will explain it better than I can.

Link works for me.
Also google "ghostery selling data".
-------------------------
data
This is a fraud. It collects and distributes data to advertising companies.
-------------------------
data
I'd rather have something that allowed me to specify which companies are allowed.  I think what we really need here is a contractual relationship (and not EULA)  whereby I agree a company can monetize my data in exchange for providing me a benefit.  Google provides me a benefit....most of the gawkers offer me nothing and deserve nothing in return.
-------------------------
data
when you install Ghostery it makes it very clear that if you opt to use it, you are allowing it to collect and potentially sell all of your data. literally the opposite of what you are probably looking for. Please read carefully...uninstall and reinstall and think about what you are allowing ghostery to do...lol.
-------------------------
data
I am tired of every site taking information from me and selling it to others, whether I am interested in something another site offers or not. It should be my choice what to share and with whom I share it...

Nobody else NEEDS my data! Nor should some site I have never heard of even WANT my data! (That always seemed creepy to me!)

I LOVE to be able to pick and choose whether to share or not... Just like with some ppl in real life, not everyone needs to know my personal business. What I do online, where I go and who I speak to is ALL my personal business!
-------------------------

Sells your data. Goes against the very reason why I used it in the first place.Disconnect is a much better option if you want good stuff.

just gotta it it 5 stars after deleting it it showed a pic of nicholas cage saying my data is exposed can't take it anymore

The app works well, but its intentions are questionable. Ghostery is funded by advertisers so its odd that they would help support such an app. 

Personally I think advertisers use the behavioral data from ghostery so they can find out what other methods they can use to feed you ads or better track your behavior. They can see how users are blocking data or what they block to sidetrack or reinvent the wheel. Be wary there are other options not tied to advertisers like disconect
-------------------------
data
I was wondering how Ghostery Inc. profited from a free extension so I looked up the company on Wikipedia. It's a double edged sword; on one hand it keeps your activities from being tracked on the other it collects data of what is blocked and sells that data to ad agencies so they can better understand what people prefer to block and not block.
-------------------------
data
They (very sneakily) admit to selling your data in the FAQ. 

Isn't that ironic.
-------------------------
data
Sells data on the ads you block to the ad companies themselves.
-------------------------
data
Per PC Magazine, Ghostery tracks and sells the information to another data gathering monger! They fail to mention this in their details about this extension. I could not find this information anywhere else on their site either. No notice that they are tracking and passing our info onto another tracking service! What a scam! It looks like they are catching tons of trackers but then taking what they track and giving that info away? Bad form!
Also, it's not functioning as it is supposed to. I'm receiving an error now. It seemed to be working fine until recently. The error states it's not tracking...and mentions a list of trackers it's not tracking! What's up with this app and the appearance of web safety when in fact they are tracking us and passing on that information? What's the use?
-------------------------
data
One of the essentials, no need to just have a tone of creepers hanging all over your data's.
-------------------------

Fantastic!  Intrusions ...if someone can access your data or see what you are viewing they can likely hack too. Blocking is the best way to go.

as long as you accept that nothing is perfect, then you should be happy. a good product, has dramatically reduced the number of times i have to wipe all my  tracking data.
-------------------------
data
It's a good blocker, but they sell the data to the companies you're trying to avoid when you're subscribed to ghostrank (which is on by default).  Just on that principle, I use Disconnect, which is a lot better anyway (doesn't break sites etc.) I'd suggest everybody move to Disconnect as it does the same things, as well as encrypting your connections when available (which Ghostery doesn't do). And they don't sell or store any data on you.

If you decide to use this extension instead of Disconnect, MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF GHOSTRANK if you don't want your browsing data sold to the same advertisement companies you're trying to avoid.
-------------------------
data
This is one good app! Only one question ~ how does Ghostery use the tracking data that it blocks??
-------------------------
data
This is a must for real privacy if you are willing to spend some time refining it a little as you browse so the sites you need to work (and which sacrifice your privacy) are given some leeway. With this, you decide who, where, when, and why any site (or any snooping corporation) gets access to data on your system or gets to track you everywhere you go.

Do not trust that your browser alone can protect you, especially if you are using Chrome, Safari, or IE. Get this now and then add HTTPS Everywhere as well.
-------------------------
data
easy to install and use. Behaves itself and let's me know what sites are doing what with my browsing data
-------------------------
data
Great plugin! Getting rid of all those nasty social plugins that are trying to collect data without an opt-out possibility. 

Some sites may have broken functionality, and sometimes you need something that Ghostery blocks, it would be nice if Ghostery had an option to temporarily allow one or more bugs to run.

Also, but this is more of a Chrome problem, it doesn't block as much as Ghostery for Firefox does. I hope Chrome will offer a decent blocking API in the future.
-------------------------
data
For what purpose do you need to collect authentication data such as passwords, security questions, and pins? If it is for creating a Ghostery account, then that should be specified. The way it is currently written seems to indicate this is for all web traffic.
-------------------------
data
Why does Ghostery request permission to read and change all your data on the websites I visit? What is it doing?
-------------------------
data
This is not an "official" answer from Ghostery. I'm a victim of these trackers too. This has led me to do a lot of research. Yes, all stores have trackers collecting data of your likes so they can have a profile on you. This way they know which ads to send you. Even when you set your "Settings" in Google Chrome or in "Tools"to not allow trackers they still track you. Also, marking "Don't save my Password" is useless; once you enter the info it's there for hackers delight. And, unfortunately, every day they become more and more sophisticated.

I've switched from using Brave to Microsoft Edge Chromium (due to the fact that Edge uses less resources than Brave and is faster than the former) and had added Adblock Plus, but it turned out to be a huge memory hog. A friend recommended Ghostery, which is remarkably lightweight and blazing fast. It blocks all ads and trackers on websites, and I've yet to encounter a broken site. Thanks!
-------------------------
slow
I've used this since around 2018 but the quality of this extension has slowly slipped ever further with every update.

The massive memory leak that it's suffered under for who knows how long has never been solved and the ticket/issue about it on the github still holds true, if you use task manager inside chrome after having ghostery active for an hour you may be surprised at how many gbs it ravenously hogs. 

Add onto the matter that it has been constantly bringing up pop ups about rewards, offers, and other nonsense.

It's practically become an ad software in it's own right along with how it almost methodically slows down your browser over time, with my end guess for such an oddity being the data that it collects on the user for unknown purposes.

It is quite sad that such a previously shining extension has slipped so far, bring back the ghostery of 2018 please, as with an i5 6600k, 16gb of ddr4 ram, a ssd, and only four tabs opened ghostery somehow has managed to drag even a fresh install of chrome to a crawl.

DOES NOT RECOMMEND at all! Extremely heavy addon! Eats GIGABYTES of RAM (and I have 16GB in dual channel)! Overloads Chrome to a point where youtube can't even load a comments when scrolling down comments section! TOTAL TRASH! It took me MONTHS to figure it out... It used to be not so heavy, but after update, after update, after update it became unusable! I disabled it in Chrome and now use AdBlock instead, which is lite and fast!

I was using Ghostery when David Cancel was the primary developer. I was concerned when it was taken over by The Better Advertising Project, due to the company publicly admitting it was working with advertisers.

A massive positive during this period is that I worked with one of their representatives, over Firefox's addon forum and through email, to address problems in their Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. The person was responsive and the company made positive changes to their policies.

Fast forward to 2019 and all that I can say is: Wow. I'm surprised that people still use this extension/addon. Has anybody actually read the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use that Cliqz provides for their services? Has anybody thought about the amount of pure trust put into using something like this?

Can Cliqz intercept your personally identifiable information before it enters their proxy network, called The Human Web? Is it technically possible and the company just asks you to trust them that your information is never collected?

When it inserts ads into your browsing experience, how does it know what ads to give you? The ads would be ineffective if improperly administered, e.g., as a male, I would not respond to female product ads.

There are financial reasons that this product has been bought and sold a few times and it's certainly not because the developers want to completely protect the user. Personal data profiles and data sets are extremely valuable in today's market and Ghostery is one way to get that information.

Ghostery might have been a good idea, but it seems as if David Cancel developed it specifically to get investment dollars with the express goal to sell the products (your and my data).

I loved the extension for more than a year.
but the latest update since mid April conflicts with some functionalities (such as Time-log & viewing images for users) in https://my.salesforce.com/console
Please fix it fast, as I cannot just dismiss it in extension settings, I had to remove it & advise everyone facing the conflict to do so.

I love ghostery, it does a great job but have found lately that it slows page load by quite a bit. I disabled it which made pages load much quicker but the downside was ALL THOSE FLAMING ADS!!!! I enabled it again to make using my browser more of a pleasure again. I would rather have a small delay than ALL OF THOSE ADS.
More speed would be a bonus guys if possible.

Updated review: It does work well but it often freezes up the browser and causes slow browsing performance. ProTip: keep the chrome task manager open so you can kill the ghostery task and reload it.

Ghostery _used to_ work well. Now it slows connections to a point where I find myself wondering if I completely lost my Wifi connection... or whether the space time continuum is collapsing onto itself. Moreover, I contacted them about the matter about a month ago and they said (I paraphrase) "they were aware and working on a solution". A month later I don't see any progress and—if at all possible—it's made my browsing experience at least twice as slow.

Whatever reason you might have for seeking out Ghostery, run the opposite direction. Not worth it.

This is true I noticed it slowing my browser rendering to a crawl so disable Ghostery until I need to use it for viewing trackers. Can also cause browser rendering pages inproperly. E.g. BBC News site loads incorrectly first time every time.

TERRIBLY slow extension which dramatically slows the load time for all my sites, getting a "Waiting for Ghostery" message in the status bar all the time. Even on Trusted sites. This should NOT be. If not for this, I would have given at least 4/5. Please fix!

Furthermore, this extension fails to actually prevent the download of blocked JavaScript. Preventing JavaScript from running is something Chrome can do by itself. I was to flat out deny the scripts from even being downloaded to my machine.

I'm one of the users that's had a terrible experience with the latest version as well. The current 5 star rating isn't representative of the user experience with the app as of now.

With Ghostery currently enabled within my extensions, my Activity Monitor shows "Google Chrome Helper" (being Ghostery) consuming 122.7% of CPU usage. My computer is screaming, my sites don't load, watching Battlestar Galactica on Hulu is now watching some weird avant garde slideshow, I keep getting rerouted to the 90's version of sites in all their plain HTML gore, and browsing has ruined my life. Thank you Ghostery for putting me through my personal version of hell.
-------------------------
slow
I'm going to agree with the large number of reviews indicating the latest version(s) of Ghostery approach being unusable.  I have version 8.0.1.2. Browsing is very, very slow (with the message 'Waiting on extension Ghostery').  The problem with needing to load websites more than once in order to get proper styling/display remains.  Some sites simply don't function (you login to your account and then are immediately logged back out).

This problems with web browsing don't occur when Ghostery is paused or disabled.

This used to be a great extension but the latest versions are just awful.

Newest update makes it very slow. Feel like it could be secretly using cpu to mine cryptocurrencies, it's just a suspicion though

Version 7 now causing random slowness on various pages.  Some pages take an eternity to load and use.  Took a while to figure out what totally screwed up my chrome browser.  Google news now takes about 30-60 seconds to load and is unresponsive while loading  (unable to scroll, click, anything.)  Now I'm nagged constantly about creating an account.  Enough with the "every web site wants you to create an account so they can track you more effectively but say it's for something else."

Ghostery has always been so easy to use, imho it's far easier to use, and the time it takes away from you in load times (i.e. internet speed) is significantly shorter than when using AdBlock and/or AdBlock Plus.

I've used this app for ever and now uninstalled it after this horrific update.  It no longer quietly works in the background but has a continual PURPLE list along the right hand side of the screen, listing all the trackers that are blocked, and which continually fills in and shifts and piles up with every page you load or as you sit and browse. This not only blocks the entire side of each page but also PRINTS if you print anything.  There's no way to take this off the page unless you manually move your hand/cursor/mouse and "X" it down after which it pops right back up and is now part of your page/screen/Life. Since Google analytics is on every page, let alone 20-50 blocked trackers you will have this giant purple list on every page, always (I had over 100 on one site and have at times 8 tabs open if not 3 browsers) Ghostery is an intrusive mess of epic proportions now. There's no fast, temporary way to suspend the app like there used to be if you're on your banking site or somewhere they need to give you a Cookie, or you find you have to let them see who you are for that moment or are having a problem signing in on some shopping site and figure you'll just turn off your adblocker and Ghostery for a second and see if that's the issue (and it usually is).  This whole app has changed and is no longer usable, user friendly or QUIET.  It makes the whole comp jerky, makes websites lag and Chrome is running with so much RAM being used (yes, I tested it with and without..it IS Ghostery causing it) that it was just simpler (and sad) to get rid of it.  We also had to uninstall it at my office because we're trying to conference call and Skype and we have this GIANT PURPLE LIST popping up while we're showing each other stuff on the web we're researching.  It's now impossible to take screen shot because Ghostery is in the way of trying to browse and use your computer.  But hey! Why shouldn't they own you like every other app thinks they do out there?  Wrong. Ghostery --  Get it together and put the old version up again until you put out a better update.
-------------------------

I used this extensions for years and it always delivered, what it promised, like noticeable faster loading webpages, blocked trackers and much more, though it broke some webpages. But version 7 ruined it, it actually slows down browsing now and heavily scripted GUI with huge font makes it totally unpractical. Basically, it has been discontinued, RIP Ghostery.

I've been using it for years now, but oddly enough didn't decide to comment until now lol... I would rate 5 stars, but for some sites, even putting it on pause, or turning it off still doesn't allow some legit sites to load. Bottomline when used with an ad blocking extension it gives us an extra layer of protection but with the ad blocker and Ghostery running at the same time even on a 64b browser it can slow loading time of pages by up to 15 seconds of staring at a blank white page while it loads.

I love the idea, but this is not the tool for me. It slowed by browser down and made me take extra steps to view content on too many websites. I basically ended up pausing blocking or whitelisting too made sites just to be able to see the content that this hid. Missing content included reviews on some sites, pictures or products on some sites (Nordstrom) and video from many sites. I am unintalling the program.

Ghostery > Disconnect. If you do a side-by-side comparison, you'll notice that Ghostery blocks more stuff than Disconnect. Seriously! Right down to the point where you can go down blocking share buttons! Of course, it makes webpages load 1 second slower than Disconnect. But I prefer privacy, over speed. Hopefully, in the future though, Ghostery will be just as fast as Disconnect.

I can't say enough about this addon. Wish I had installed it ages ago. I've noticed a huge improvement with no interference to the speed of things. Other than a few instances where I couldn't figure out which tracker was preventing videos/online tools to work, I have no complaints.

Great blocking app, catching more trackers than "do not track me" did. BUT it REALLY slows down Chrome, particularly it seems after the browser has been open for a few hours.

I know the slowdown is due to Ghostery because a message appears at the bottom of the browser saying it's waiting for Ghostery. :-(  Very frustrating.
-------------------------

Great, except for one (browser related) problem: Ghostery for Chrome doesn't block as much as Firefox (cookies etc.), but this is because Chrome doesn't have the appropriate APIs. If you want more control (and less speed), use Firefox.

Has been excellent over the weeks that I've tried it. (popup time is configurable btw) However with the very latest versions of Chrome it seems to be slowing down browsing quite a bit. I'm sure that's solved soon.

It does slow the system down. But, not willing to give it up just yet.

First I though this is useful..than I found out it slows down my browsing significantly ..and to make matters worse...some web sites just don´t show up anymore and chrome tells me the site could be down or so.  naeh, the sites are all there..after I uninstalled it.

It really does bog a system down. Slow loading pages. I know it has to take some juice to run, but sometimes it makes my cable modem feel like old DSL. Also, Lots of bugs still get through.

According to the task manager Ghostery is using anywhere from 5-12% CPU while there is no web page activity going on - no interaction with the web browser at all. thx :m:

I have noticed that your plugin of late has been using unusually high CPU usage (25% on i7 7700k). It is an issue specific to the process that ghostery is running in, isolated via chrome task manager. I have trusted your application for a while but am weary of cryptominers in similar blocking applications. Can you provide a valid reason for this occurrence?

Hi, I never had any issues with Ghostery installed, but lately, a lot of websites load way slower than usual, and often it says something like "waiting for Ghostery extension" in the loading field in the lower left corner of Chrome. Has something been changed, or can I try changing a setting to speed it up again?
-------------------------

With the latest version of Chrome (as of May 29, 2018), the Ghostery extension's chrome Helper process retains over 100% of Cpu. I know it could be an issue with Chrome, but thought you should know, as it's kind of a deal breaker for using ghostery until resolved. Video: https://vimeo.com/272446885

I can't get rid of them. I started using the "incognito" window and they planted a tracker there too. Someone told me it's Google Chrome the problem. PLEASE GET THEM OUT OF MY SYSTEM NOW! Whatever this is makes my connection very slow and shuts me off when it pleases.

cpu
I'm using this super extention in chrome and firefox (both latest versions for W7). But since I use it I notice that the CPU is working a lot harder (normally around 9% now around 46%), and the time is going into chrome and firefox. (This is not green! It results worldwide in a use amount of extra energy consumed, we are talking about the size of several powerplants) Bigger problem is that both browsers are crashing a lot. When I disable ghostery the crashing and timeconsuming stops. When I google https://www.google.nl/search?q=ghoserey+increase+cpu+usage I see more reports. Is there any development on these problems. Yours, PJFR

Back again...lol! Found this terrific hack for Google Chrome to access https only sites. If you want it, send me one million dollars to...ok, ok...here it is: In your address bar, type: chrome://settings/content/...scroll down until you see 'JavaScript'...click off the button(it will show 'Blocked') and 'Add' this: https://*
Or, open Settings (...in the 3 vertical dots...upper right)...click 'Privacy and security'(left side menu)...scroll down to 'Site Settings'...scroll down to 'JavaScript'...
Caveat: I just started using this hack and everything seems fine so far! If I have any problems or find out that this hack is not 100%, then I will report back...
-------------------------
block
Not so good.  It also blocks https sites.

It works as expected. It is useful to block all insecure sites on public hotspots.

As a non programmer we have no idea what it really do.Still before last update it at least showing the list of site cookies tracking every site I visit and written over there forced encryption to HTTPS.Now with this new update no site cookies which tracking me it shows so it become worthless not onlt that with every HTTP site it starts warning me block it and ask me whether I want to open it or not and pretending asif it will find and open the HTTPS site if available for that site.Now we are not blind we can see in which site HTTP written which site HTTPS written,if from a layman or user point it is just doing thsi then we just no need of this garbage extension any longer.Good bye Mr. Famous Garbage app developer,so called HTTPS encrytion maker lol..SO NOW AFTER LATEST UPDATE IT BECOME HTTPS FINDER FROM HTTPS EVERYWHERE,WHY NOT THEN CHANGE THE NAME TO HTTPS FINDER AND EXPECT KIDS TO USE UR DUSTBIN APP??

HTTPS Everywhere is blocking access to Youtube, and many other sites, as of today. Nothing has changed on my system.
-------------------------
detect
I couldn't detect any functionality. Plenty of not secure "http" sites.
It's NOT "https" everywhere.
-------------------------
block
This extension does not magically convert insecure connections to secure ones. It simply ensures that HTTPS is chosen over HTTP if both are available. You can also set it to block all plain HTTP connections if desired.
-------------------------
block
This extension does not magically turn every HTTP site into HTTPS. Instead, if an HTTPS version exists, it'll use that instead. However, if it doesn't exist, it'll use the plain HTTP version.

In the settings, if you tick the thing that says "Encrypt all sites eligible", it'll block any HTTP requests, but allow any HTTPS requests.

If you want to be warned if it's only HTTP, the browser should already have a warning. If you see a closed lock next in the address bar next to the URL, it's using HTTPS. If you see "Not Secure", it's using HTTP.
-------------------------
block
Sometimes you can't even block unencrypted or else the website gets blocked, there is nothing that tells you that it is making a website "https://", it didn't even make a single site "https://" for me
-------------------------
block
This may be fixed by uninstalling and doing a clean install, if it is still not working you might check in your extensions to ensure it is ON. If neither of those quick fixes work, you might have something running that's blocking it, and if you ask a question in the proper section above I'm sure someone who knows a lot more can help you.
-------------------------
block
this tool is great all unsecure sites are now blocked thanks!
-------------------------
block
It's amazing i feel protected but,
It blocks the page of my ISP and saying the connection is not secured.
and yes, "block all uncrypted connection's" is on.
-------------------------
block
Because you are blocking all non HTTPS websites, your ISP must not be using HTTPS for the website. HTTPS everywhere only forces websites to use HTTPS if the site is capable 
-------------------------
block
I'm an EFF supporter and it saddens me to leave this review, but currently the developers don't seem to care about a conflict this extension is creating with ublock.
While the extension technically works, it's currently runs before ublock enabling advertisers to subvert it's attempts at blocking advertisers from tracking you.  After 3 years of use I'm uninstalling.
-------------------------
block
This extension seems to be tracking and or marketing.  I keep getting an extension error, saying that Ublock Origin has blocked communication of HTTPS Everywhere.  Here's the latest address blocked by Ublock Origin:

https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/

I'm not sure why HTTPS Everywhere wants to connect to google analytics but I'm glad Ublock stopped it
-------------------------
protect
SSL Enforcer seems to malfunction at least once per session. This causes a total lockout...I think.

This is a far better means of protecting my location information.
-------------------------
bypass
A mandatory extension to safe browsing. On some cases, this can be paired with DNScrypt to bypass internet filter set by your ISP, hehehe XD
-------------------------
block
Absolutely indispensible. If you don't use this, you're probably transmitting credentials and other sensitive information in the clear without even knowing it. Just install the extension. Ignore the negative reviews. If it blocks you from a website -- that means it's doing its job. Some websites don't support TLS yet, even today. That's their fault, and you should let them know that it matters to your safety and security.
-------------------------
block
Blocks too many websites.
-------------------------
block
maybe your blocked websites do not allow https request which I assume they are not secure enough.
-------------------------
block
It blocks the sites that need blocking. 
-------------------------
block
Just you know, HTTPS and HTTP have nothing to do with you getting malware or ads. Malicious domains are using HTTPS more and more now anyway as its entirely free to get an SSL certificate. You will still run into the same malicious domains as before, but you can install Ublock Origin to automatically block all ads and most malicious domains (Ublock Origin is also available here in the Chrome store free)
-------------------------
detect
Good tool, bad politics.
The tool works to enable HTTPS where it is detected as optional.

However, the organization that owns the copyright to this tool is involved in some hyper-radical campaigns, like trying to kill a bill intended to help prosecute sex offenses.

Would be 5 stars if EFF wasn't looking out only for criminals, but for the small-time folks who have legitimate issues.
-------------------------
block
Blocks access to sites that don't have and don't need to use https, and it doesn't have a visible extension icon to golle it off.  

That's a problem.
-------------------------
block
works for me in the chrome but when i tick the block all unencrypted requests tick box it blocks most news sites. Does this mean these sites refuse https? I did have a veggie volcano pizza for my breakfast if that helps?
-------------------------
prevent
how does open source prevent data snooping?
-------------------------
block
I don't know what's up with this, I used it in Firefox for many years without a problem, but in Chrome, it never makes websites go to HTTPS. They stay HTTP. I had to install KB SSL Enforcer because this one did nothing at all. But I wish HTTPS Everywhere worked, because I'd like to block unencrypted requests and KB SSL Enforcer can't do that.
-------------------------
block
At the point it decides to block websites because it can't decode commercial resenders like akamai, it's past its usefulness to me.
-------------------------
prevent
Good when it works correctly. I find it sometimes breaks websites, preventing them from loading correctly until I disable it, refresh the page, and re-enable it.

I suppose it has something to do with trying to load all the page's resources securely (and failing on some of them), but then after they're loaded once and cached (with the extension disabled), the page loads okay?

Great idea, just a bit of a pain to use at times.
-------------------------
bypass
This is a good tool but it breaks things and no matter what you select or rules you make with it running it WILL NOT allow      me to force pause it for a site that it breaks with it's so called *STABLE* filters. On the Chrome OS the rule sets just don't stick and it won't allow redirect without completely disabling it in extensions. It's good in concept, but very broken if you can't bypass it without totally disabling it! I want a tool that I have control over if it breaks a site, A tool that has the option to disable the redirects on  one page. Until that time it's getting disabled because it isn't working the way i'd like it to.
-------------------------
protect
This HELPS protect privacy, but depends on the number of sites that support https . many of sites do not use https !!

Worked for quite some time, but at some point in time google started flooding my browser with redirect notices instead of simply redirecting - it was an acceptable trade off in order to get rid of MITM-using idiots on the shared dorm network. But then issues started multiplying - steam sites were completely unusable. As much as I like safety, privacy, and protection, I also like using websites.
-------------------------
block
This is okay. It could be better but until it does I truly recommend another much better extension called "Data Compression Proxy(*a.k.a. - DCP)". It works just like this extension the difference btwn the two are the privacy. DCP compresses http traffic then tunnels it through a private connection (HTTPS) while blocking ad trackers that attempt to trace surfers online. After installing it users can surf to a site called http:// 'what is my ip' .com w/ their Chrome browser and notice their browser's ip address change w/ a different and new geo-location displayed to other sites visited. This is how their traffic is tunnelled and compressed through anonymous servers throughout various private  geo-locations and regions. I have given it four stars,  by far.
-------------------------
detect
It works ok, but it doesn't detect some sites that do offer https and slows things a bit (only noticable if you visit a website a lot before using the extension).
-------------------------
prevent
Excellent software, unfortunately it prevents Amazon Prime Instant Video from loading.
-------------------------

I trust this to help defend my computer, but I wish it would block embedded videos and streams.

"Prevents NSA" DONE!

Brilliant idea and thank you for building it

I now have problems with flash videos on news websites (BBC etc.)
Confirmed it is this extension by disabling/enabling all my extensions one at a time - this was the one that caused me the problem

Would be handy to be able to prevent it running on some websites to help get around this problem
-------------------------
protect
I'm giving it five stars because it does what it says it will do; and it does it really well. And I love the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

However, the extension effectively breaks an awful lot of websites. This, of course, is because the people who build sites which use SSL will put some of the site's components on parts of the server (or on other servers) that aren't protected by SSL, while the rest of the site is so protected. That whole mixing-up of things, even if one doesn't use HTTPS Everywhere, can really goof things up. So it's not HTTPS Everywhere's fault.

That said, it's a pain in the rear to figure out what to uncheck in order to make the site finally work; and sometimes it's just more than it's worth. 

The truth is that even before I started using HTTPS Everywhere, I already had a good habit of forcing the "s" at the end of "http" in all my URLs; and watching the combobox (the browser's "Address:" field) to ensure that the "s" was always there whenever and/or if ever I was using the notebook on WI-FI (which I never do at home, so I don't have to be as vigilant) in a public place. I had hoped HTTPS Everywhere would make it so that I didn't have to be as vigilant, but the trade-off the all the sites it breaks (er... rather, more accurately, all the sites that it reveals are broken because their makers mixed secure and unsecure components on the same page) is sometimes not worth it.

I've temporarily disabled it on my machine because of all that, but I'm sure I'll re-enable it. It's just too important to have something like it running.

I just wish HTTPS Everywhere's devs would figure-out a better way.

It's a terrific extension, though; don't get me wrong. It's really, really good. Just make sure, if you use it, that your eyes are wide open about all the sites that may all of a sudden not work right; and so for which you'll have to click on the HTTPS Everywhere toolbutton and uncheck something. It can get pretty frustating.

Hope that helps.

The extension is fantastic and I absolutely recommend using it! The reason I give it this negative review is that on the last automatic update it opened a new tab to show new features. This happened while I was doing something that required my attention and it got me out of that enough for a minute to feel annoying. I understand the urge to let users know of new features in your product but in my opinion this should never happen on it's own. (Non-blockable popup triggered by an automatic update without any user interaction.) Please find a better solution for this. How about a notification on the icon so that I can take a look when I want to instead of feeling pushed into it and being potentially distracted from whatever I'm currently doing?

bug
"HTTPS Everywhere" keeps crashing whenever I fire up the Chrome Web Browser! Normally, I'd recommend this extension but NOT on a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) with TwisterOS as the operating system. I seem to recall having this same issue under other Linux OS's too (and not necessarily with just one RazPi either). The good news is that "HTTPS Everywhere" does seem to work with other browsers like Firefox ESR. So it might just be a Google / Microsoft thing (hard to tell where browsers are concerned) and may be just one more reason to NOT use Chrome Web Browser or its ugly cousin Microsoft Edge (if/when that becomes available for Linux). What say you, EFF, or whoever's doing the debugging? Why does your extension not (seem to) work with just the Chrome Web Browser under the Linux distro Twister OS for a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB)?

I also realize what I'm using isn't exactly considered "main stream" and may not even be at the top of anyone's check list nor even on most developer's radar. Anyone reading this must understand, "HTTPS Everywhere" is normally an awesome extension. Nevertheless, I still gotta give it a one-star "hate it" rating as a Chrome Extension here because, you know, someone should have caught what seems like a pretty big bug and, if for no other reason than it keeps crashing with Chrome on my Raspberry Pi. (Very annoying.)

access
It can only force the page to load secure if the page provider actually provides the page in https version. If the page you try to access offers only http there is no way to access it securely. It is not this extension's fault, the administrator of the page you want to access needs to setup the https encryption on their end.
-------------------------
error
All it does, is add "https://" to all the websites you're trying to connect to. So most of them, that don't have an SSL, get flagged as privacy error.
-------------------------
stop
Today it stopped loading https everywhere.  I do not understand why but i have been having pages open in http and I don't know a solution to this problem.
-------------------------
load
Its a great extension overall! But it slows down the loading time of the every page to verify if its connected to the HTTPS server. If security is your main priority then go for it. If speed is your priority I suggest skipping this one since chrome itself works fine, personally I don't think its the its worth the throttling of speed because almost all website use HTTPS anyway.
-------------------------
load
For both Max Hu and Sethu Senthil: Helpful? Yes *and* No. As it's currently set up, it doesn't "force websites to use https," and at present, it isn't the case that "almost all websites use HTTPS anyway". In his notes, the developer discusses why we don't yet have a global method for substituting "https://" at the left end of any arbitrary URL. With some experience, you *can* get some clue as to where the substitution will work, but so far, it's far short of rocket science. It would be nice if the ext could search for working secure versions of the URL, but my guess is that doing so would further slow the loading time.
-------------------------

Corruption bug appears to have a workaround.  Posted by Anand Bhat:

For all those having issues with the latest version showing as corrupt, try these steps:

1. Install extension.
2. Once it shows "This extension may have been corrupted", go back to the Chrome store and open up this extension's page (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp).
3. The top of the page will have this text -- "This item has been disabled in Chrome. Enable this item". Click it.
4. Extension will get activated!

The developers of this extension are aware of this and it is due to bug in Chrome. More details can be found at https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere/issues/5874#issuecomment-245493840

Basically, it's not good for an extension-heavy Chrome install. As others have said, this extension is severely lacking in options. In addition to no way to edit rules you also have no whitelist and no blacklist. It's all or nothing, and that results in "Extension Error" messages in Chrome because it conflicts with certain other extensions.
-------------------------

If you care about privacy you need this extension. Occasionally I find it breaks some site though. That can be fixed by disabling the rule which causes the problem, but you first need to find which rule.

Breaks some websites, such as Wix.com, and the add-on does not have support for exclusions.

Awesome company, awesome extension. I feel safe trusting this extension with encrypting my connections. I haven't noticed the high ram usage that others have. In fact, HTTPSEverywhere appears to be one of the lowest ram users amongst Ghostery, Adblock, Lastpass, and a mass of other extensions I use. As for the EFF, not only are they an awesome organization, but they respond quickly and efficiently to vulnerabilities when reported. I've been using this extension for years, and have had maybe four or five sites break with it, all of which worked after unchecking the corresponding boxes in the extension's menu.

For some reason my mac stopped loading jquery or other CDN scripts on most websites I was visiting.  Using this plugin has solved the problem.

Seems to work fine bug uses a HUGE amount of RAM. Over 200 MB on my Macbook Pro, which is the same as what the entire Chrome app uses without any extensions loaded. That's crazy for an extension that just changes http:// to https://

It made some websites not loading properly or in some cases have various DNS error. Otherwise it still a good security.

Can cause long delays(minutes) when loading a web page, safe but troublesom

break
Good when it works correctly. I find it sometimes breaks websites, preventing them from loading correctly until I disable it, refresh the page, and re-enable it.

I suppose it has something to do with trying to load all the page's resources securely (and failing on some of them), but then after they're loaded once and cached (with the extension disabled), the page loads okay?

Great idea, just a bit of a pain to use at times.
-------------------------

It would be really nice if there was either a toggle to disable on the extension icon, or a way to whitelist websites for the extension to ignore.  Can't load ads on Hulu, which can cause issues with watching.
-------------------------

In addition to the previous comments, it would also be nice to have an exceptions list, to add sites that you don't even want it to attempt an SSL connection.

I've noticed it can really slow down the loading of a site when it's attempting a SSL connection to a site that doesn't have it available at all.
-------------------------
break
As has been said below, this extension only works on some sites. It tests whether it has HTTPS functionality, and if it does, the next time you go to the site it will enforce HTTPS. Personally, I think this is an advantage in the fact that it breaks less websites than other solutions.

It will still break some websites, but not many. The main instances I found were where the extension was conflicting with another extension that redirects to a website (WikiWand for example).

This is easily fixed by clicking the icon and white-listing when you are on the site. For WikiWand, I think I whitelisted WikiMedia and WikiCommons, for example.
-------------------------
break
This is a good tool but it breaks things and no matter what you select or rules you make with it running it WILL NOT allow      me to force pause it for a site that it breaks with it's so called *STABLE* filters. On the Chrome OS the rule sets just don't stick and it won't allow redirect without completely disabling it in extensions. It's good in concept, but very broken if you can't bypass it without totally disabling it! I want a tool that I have control over if it breaks a site, A tool that has the option to disable the redirects on  one page. Until that time it's getting disabled because it isn't working the way i'd like it to.
-------------------------
break
The latest revision of the app breaks "traditional browsing."  While it enhances security and definitely lets you know what sites do SSL properly, and what sites do not, it is a PITA  to be turning the app off/on for each website you visit.  It is also no longer auto-redirecting to the http site, or https site pending what you type in the URL bar.  Seems like this needs to be fixed up...now too difficult to use for typical users.

Worked great until a few weeks ago and now it randomly causes a third of the images in my tumblr feed to not load. Weird, specific issue, I know. Systematically disabled all my extensions to find what was doing it.

Don't load it on a Mac. There is a memory error that causes severe memory usage problems. Loading 2-3 tabs will completely consume memory, causing severe slowdowns and OSX crash/hangs. Disable it and all the problems go away.

Just stay away. Security is good but a working machine is better.

I was trying to figure out why each new tab took an extra 2-10 seconds to load and then I noticed in the bottom left corner: "Waiting for https everywhere extension"

This app has great intentions, but it broke a lot of the functionality on Amazon for some reason (e.g. I couldn't even click dropdown menus). Disabling it fixed this.

Its a useful extension, BUT it does cause issues with some websites. (E.g. not being able to load, missing images, false positive"unsafe content" warnings."

This extension breaks waaay to many web sites to be usable. In particular I find embedded  videos fail, and it's really annoying having to dig around with various extensions to figure out which is responsible. I've disabled this extension as I want to be able to watch web videos.
-------------------------
load
It won't load flash videos at all on a couple of websites (Youtube works just fine though), and sometimes I don't even know if the video is there. The problem was fixed as soon as I turned this, and only this, extension off. Would not recommend beta version.

Excellent software, unfortunately it prevents Amazon Prime Instant Video from loading.
-------------------------
break
Great extention, but it breaks many pages that can serve https but use insecure content, like streaming via flash, etc.
-------------------------
load
Does a good job but needs to handle exceptions/exclusions better. Too often it is down to the user to conclude that it is HTTPS Everywhere's actions that is why a page will not load or be displayed correctly.
-------------------------
break
The goal is valiant and necessary but the implementation is bad. Breaks on many video-related sites and doesn't give any clear indication of how or what to disable to get it working again.
-------------------------
break
I'm giving it five stars because it does what it says it will do; and it does it really well. And I love the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

However, the extension effectively breaks an awful lot of websites. This, of course, is because the people who build sites which use SSL will put some of the site's components on parts of the server (or on other servers) that aren't protected by SSL, while the rest of the site is so protected. That whole mixing-up of things, even if one doesn't use HTTPS Everywhere, can really goof things up. So it's not HTTPS Everywhere's fault.

That said, it's a pain in the rear to figure out what to uncheck in order to make the site finally work; and sometimes it's just more than it's worth. 

The truth is that even before I started using HTTPS Everywhere, I already had a good habit of forcing the "s" at the end of "http" in all my URLs; and watching the combobox (the browser's "Address:" field) to ensure that the "s" was always there whenever and/or if ever I was using the notebook on WI-FI (which I never do at home, so I don't have to be as vigilant) in a public place. I had hoped HTTPS Everywhere would make it so that I didn't have to be as vigilant, but the trade-off the all the sites it breaks (er... rather, more accurately, all the sites that it reveals are broken because their makers mixed secure and unsecure components on the same page) is sometimes not worth it.

I've temporarily disabled it on my machine because of all that, but I'm sure I'll re-enable it. It's just too important to have something like it running.

I just wish HTTPS Everywhere's devs would figure-out a better way.

It's a terrific extension, though; don't get me wrong. It's really, really good. Just make sure, if you use it, that your eyes are wide open about all the sites that may all of a sudden not work right; and so for which you'll have to click on the HTTPS Everywhere toolbutton and uncheck something. It can get pretty frustating.

Hope that helps.

Is a sorely needed extension, but no option for EXCEPTIONS.  This breaks Amazon Instant video playback of some DRM content, for many people [and was not easy to discover].

Though Concept of using https connection on websites which supports SSL is very useful, but this Extension interferes with Flash Content on YouTube and other sites. When Enabled, YouTube videos barely buffers and it also stops working of Internet Download Managers Extension on YouTube to download the videos.

Another downside is that it only forces https connection to those web pages which are updated in its database.

"HTTPS Everywhere" keeps crashing whenever I fire up the Chrome Web Browser! Normally, I'd recommend this extension but NOT on a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) with TwisterOS as the operating system. I seem to recall having this same issue under other Linux OS's too (and not necessarily with just one RazPi either). The good news is that "HTTPS Everywhere" does seem to work with other browsers like Firefox ESR. So it might just be a Google / Microsoft thing (hard to tell where browsers are concerned) and may be just one more reason to NOT use Chrome Web Browser or its ugly cousin Microsoft Edge (if/when that becomes available for Linux). What say you, EFF, or whoever's doing the debugging? Why does your extension not (seem to) work with just the Chrome Web Browser under the Linux distro Twister OS for a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB)?

I also realize what I'm using isn't exactly considered "main stream" and may not even be at the top of anyone's check list nor even on most developer's radar. Anyone reading this must understand, "HTTPS Everywhere" is normally an awesome extension. Nevertheless, I still gotta give it a one-star "hate it" rating as a Chrome Extension here because, you know, someone should have caught what seems like a pretty big bug and, if for no other reason than it keeps crashing with Chrome on my Raspberry Pi.

I think this extension should have an option to whitelist sites (e.g. current domain) rather than having to disable it for each nonfunctioning site.

5 stars for effort, but honestly this extension is becoming less relevant by the day. Chrome is hard-pushing https (which is absolutely the right thing to do), so the great majority of sites anyone visit these days are already https by default.

is this really neccessary, I mean if a site is HTTPS enabled, wouldn't it be turned on by default, otherwise what's the point?
-------------------------
default
Short answer NO, sites that have HTTPS enabled do not always go to HTTPS by default. 

Longer answer. Some sites allow port 80 (HTTP - without TLS/SSL) or port 443 (HTTPS - with TLS/SSL). Those sites will use port 80 unless the user types the HTTPS in the address. This tool redirects sites that have both bindings enabled to always use port 443.

Appears rules can only be created, not viewed or deleted.  Nice effort, but needs work.

Starting to experience problems! You will see the JavaScript warning in Google Chrome's address bar. Click on it and it will tell you specifically what script is not allowed. I went back to the recommended JavaScript setting as the warnings became too frequent. Oh well...I think I am going to switch to Firefox as it has an inbuilt https mode only feature.

Back again...lol! Found this terrific hack for Google Chrome to access https only sites. If you want it, send me one million dollars to...ok, ok...here it is: In your address bar, type: chrome://settings/content/...scroll down until you see 'JavaScript'...click off the button(it will show 'Blocked') and 'Add' this: https://*
Or, open Settings (...in the 3 vertical dots...upper right)...click 'Privacy and security'(left side menu)...scroll down to 'Site Settings'...scroll down to 'JavaScript'...
Caveat: I just started using this hack and everything seems fine so far! If I have any problems or find out that this hack is not 100%, then I will report back...

"HTTPS Everywhere" keeps crashing whenever I fire up the Chrome Web Browser! Normally, I'd recommend this extension but NOT on a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) with TwisterOS as the operating system. I seem to recall having this same issue under other Linux OS's too (and not necessarily with just one RazPi either). The good news is that "HTTPS Everywhere" does seem to work with other browsers like Firefox ESR. So it might just be a Google / Microsoft thing (hard to tell where browsers are concerned) and may be just one more reason to NOT use Chrome Web Browser or its ugly cousin Microsoft Edge (if/when that becomes available for Linux). What say you, EFF, or whoever's doing the debugging? Why does your extension not (seem to) work with just the Chrome Web Browser under the Linux distro Twister OS for a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB)?

I also realize what I'm using isn't exactly considered "main stream" and may not even be at the top of anyone's check list nor even on most developer's radar. Anyone reading this must understand, "HTTPS Everywhere" is normally an awesome extension. Nevertheless, I still gotta give it a one-star "hate it" rating as a Chrome Extension here because, you know, someone should have caught what seems like a pretty big bug and, if for no other reason than it keeps crashing with Chrome on my Raspberry Pi. (Very annoying.)

If you're getting a 302 error then you're probably using a non-standard browser which doesn't implement the http1.1 specifications.Try using a modern, up-to-date browser. 307 passes the exact same request to the redirect, so there's absolutely no reason to complain about rules for it as it's an exact duplicate request as originally sent before the redirection.
-------------------------
browser
This extension does not magically turn every HTTP site into HTTPS. Instead, if an HTTPS version exists, it'll use that instead. However, if it doesn't exist, it'll use the plain HTTP version.

In the settings, if you tick the thing that says "Encrypt all sites eligible", it'll block any HTTP requests, but allow any HTTPS requests.

If you want to be warned if it's only HTTP, the browser should already have a warning. If you see a closed lock next in the address bar next to the URL, it's using HTTPS. If you see "Not Secure", it's using HTTP.
-------------------------
browser
This should be a default setting turned on in every modern browser. Why is HTTP still a thing? This add-on is God send.
-------------------------
browser
Chrome and some other browsers have a built in option to use HTTPS, but it's off by default. I'm not sure why this extension is needed anymore.

uses too much memory around 150MB ? developers need to make this lighter. for an extension with no extra features and options it sure hogs a lot of browser ram.  where is all that memory going?
-------------------------
browser
This should be an option of every browser. It has some problems with some pages, but it is a rare occasion, happening when the page you try to open does not support https. It is very rare though for me, since even these pages open as http, but it does happen at times.

Keep in mind though that it can end up using up to 500MB or RAM(WOW), which makes it a quite heavy extension for computers that do not have much RAM.

It has served well for many years, but by now another alternative HTTPS extension I use, uses only like 15MB. I suggest people to search a bit on the google webstore for alternatives.
-------------------------
browser
Can't say I'm having the memory issue that others are (but if that is a concern then Chrome itself is the worst browser you could have).

My problem is...why is this not _forcing_ https on all sites that feature it?  I shouldn't have to edit ebay's url manually when I have this installed.  Looking elsewhere

Good idea, woeful execution; a complete memory hog.

As I type this, with two tabs open, this extension is consuming more memory than the core browser process.

Chome's task manager shows a current tally of 97580K, compared to the Browser's 94932K.

100MB for an extension that does little but redirect to https where possible on the client side? For chromebooks and the like, that's pretty ridiculous.

Fix that, and this extension should be a must-install for most people.
-------------------------
browser
I like HTTPS Everywhere, but I would wish for some better compatibility for Vivaldi Browser. I know the browser is pretty new.
-------------------------
browser
JavaScript is auto garbage collected, which means the browser handles memory usage. There is nothing developers can do about it.

Worked for quite some time, but at some point in time google started flooding my browser with redirect notices instead of simply redirecting - it was an acceptable trade off in order to get rid of MITM-using idiots on the shared dorm network. But then issues started multiplying - steam sites were completely unusable. As much as I like safety, privacy, and protection, I also like using websites.
-------------------------
browser
This is okay. It could be better but until it does I truly recommend another much better extension called "Data Compression Proxy(*a.k.a. - DCP)". It works just like this extension the difference btwn the two are the privacy. DCP compresses http traffic then tunnels it through a private connection (HTTPS) while blocking ad trackers that attempt to trace surfers online. After installing it users can surf to a site called http:// 'what is my ip' .com w/ their Chrome browser and notice their browser's ip address change w/ a different and new geo-location displayed to other sites visited. This is how their traffic is tunnelled and compressed through anonymous servers throughout various private  geo-locations and regions. I have given it four stars,  by far.
-------------------------
browser
I'm giving it five stars because it does what it says it will do; and it does it really well. And I love the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

However, the extension effectively breaks an awful lot of websites. This, of course, is because the people who build sites which use SSL will put some of the site's components on parts of the server (or on other servers) that aren't protected by SSL, while the rest of the site is so protected. That whole mixing-up of things, even if one doesn't use HTTPS Everywhere, can really goof things up. So it's not HTTPS Everywhere's fault.

That said, it's a pain in the rear to figure out what to uncheck in order to make the site finally work; and sometimes it's just more than it's worth. 

The truth is that even before I started using HTTPS Everywhere, I already had a good habit of forcing the "s" at the end of "http" in all my URLs; and watching the combobox (the browser's "Address:" field) to ensure that the "s" was always there whenever and/or if ever I was using the notebook on WI-FI (which I never do at home, so I don't have to be as vigilant) in a public place. I had hoped HTTPS Everywhere would make it so that I didn't have to be as vigilant, but the trade-off the all the sites it breaks (er... rather, more accurately, all the sites that it reveals are broken because their makers mixed secure and unsecure components on the same page) is sometimes not worth it.

I've temporarily disabled it on my machine because of all that, but I'm sure I'll re-enable it. It's just too important to have something like it running.

I just wish HTTPS Everywhere's devs would figure-out a better way.

It's a terrific extension, though; don't get me wrong. It's really, really good. Just make sure, if you use it, that your eyes are wide open about all the sites that may all of a sudden not work right; and so for which you'll have to click on the HTTPS Everywhere toolbutton and uncheck something. It can get pretty frustating.

Hope that helps.

It can only force the page to load secure if the page provider actually provides the page in https version. If the page you try to access offers only http there is no way to access it securely.

Awesome company, awesome extension. I feel safe trusting this extension with encrypting my connections. I haven't noticed the high ram usage that others have. In fact, HTTPSEverywhere appears to be one of the lowest ram users amongst Ghostery, Adblock, Lastpass, and a mass of other extensions I use. As for the EFF, not only are they an awesome organization, but they respond quickly and efficiently to vulnerabilities when reported. I've been using this extension for years, and have had maybe four or five sites break with it, all of which worked after unchecking the corresponding boxes in the extension's menu.

HTTPS Everywhere is theoretically a great extension, but doesn't work as well as you'd hope. 
When most sites use an unencrypted connection, they mean it and don't support encrypted connections. This means that HTTPS Everywhere has actually broken some perfectly legit web apps, like Google Keep, that require a normal connection to work.
On some sites, it's perfect, but when it doesn't work as well, it's a pain to go in and disable rules to let sites work.
-------------------------

A useful extension, though not nearly as powerful as the Firefox version. Unfortunately the latest update causes Chrome on Mac to completely hang, all tabs unresponsive. The application won't even quit normally and must be forced to close. I hope the EFF releases a fix very soon, as these are times when encryption is more important than ever.

Its a great extension overall! But it slows down the loading time of the every page to verify if its connected to the HTTPS server. If security is your main priority then go for it. If speed is your priority I suggest skipping this one since chrome itself works fine, personally I don't think its the its worth the throttling of speed because almost all website use HTTPS anyway.
-------------------------
slow
For both Max Hu and Sethu Senthil: Helpful? Yes *and* No. As it's currently set up, it doesn't "force websites to use https," and at present, it isn't the case that "almost all websites use HTTPS anyway". In his notes, the developer discusses why we don't yet have a global method for substituting "https://" at the left end of any arbitrary URL. With some experience, you *can* get some clue as to where the substitution will work, but so far, it's far short of rocket science. It would be nice if the ext could search for working secure versions of the URL, but my guess is that doing so would further slow the loading time.

In addition to the previous comments, it would also be nice to have an exceptions list, to add sites that you don't even want it to attempt an SSL connection.

Not able to report an issue with Google hangouts: Invalid URL. - https://hangouts.google.com/ - Disconnect blocks audio (speakers) from getting through. It is possible to be heard (microphone works). There is no real way to know that Disconnect is doing this, other than with trial and error. It took me a while to figure it out.
-------------------------
block
Wish it had a dedicated settings page. Either something like AdGuard or AdBlock Plus. I really just like using this for its diagram, however it is impossible to disable the extension blocking feature globally and seems to only work site by site. That way one could view the "light beam" spider web of connections and seem how other extensions are working.
-------------------------

I'd used Disconnect for several years. As of this writing Disconnect is blocking access to the Gmail interface, and it does this same thing in both Chrome and Brave. So I'll either choose to abandon Chrome-based browsers and instead use Opera, or I'll abandon Disconnect.

The antivirus BLOCKS your site....WHY?????
-------------------------
block
There could be many reasons why it would block an uncommon extension. It probably isn't listed as safe because it isn't a major extension.
-------------------------
block
Um, Doubleclick is owned by google, that's how they serve ads? It's not a notorious tracker it's Google's ad serving platform. Yes you could block it with some of the ad blockers. Google did announce re branding of Doubleclick tho, dunno what their plans with it are.

My advice is: 
1. Use Disconnect and some AdBlocker
2. Update your HOSTS file (just google how to do it).
You can download maintaned list of variuos ad platforms/redirect ad/affiliate networks/ malicious sites to put into your HOSTS file (thus blocking it — basically by putting www.somesite.com 0.0.0.0 (or 127.0.0.1 aka the loopback ip) you tell your system to ignore the DNS server and use HOSTS file and thus redirect said unwanted site back to non-routable meta-address (0.0.0.0) or loopback (locahost) so it doesn't resolve.
That's super effective way of blocking stuff.

Here's some links for maintaned HOSTS files:
https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/ aka "How to make the Internet not suck (as much)" and
http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm  by Winhelp

Alternatively you could use those two and autoupdate the hosts file with a script such as:
https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
Steven Black's script uses both data from someonewhocares and MVPS and few others (malwaredomainlist etc). 

All sites I mentioned are free, they are doing great work and they update lists of malicious sites regularly.

Hope this helps. 

DIsclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with Disconnect nor any other extension or the sites I linked.

a few to many false positives, for example it blocks the google login popup.
-------------------------
block
That isn't a false positive, Google's login popup is a tracker and as such is blocked. Same goes for Facebook and any other OpenID login. If you want to whitelist Google then you can login, if not then make an account on the site without using an OpenID like Google or Facebook.
-------------------------
block
Although I like this extension because it gives me a visual of all of the sites that are tracking me when I am browsing -- but it doesn't block trackers! 

Unfortunately, it doesn't actually appear to be stopping them from tracking me. I tested it on several privacy test websites including panopticlick and others, it does not appear to block trackers. That is disappointing, as I always thought it did. 

I will keep it for when I want to view the list of trackers, but I don't plan on using it. Test it yourself -- don't just take its word that it is blocking tracking.
-------------------------
block
This is the most lightweight tracking blocking extension but it needs a pause function for when I do online surveys and they need to track me. I just end up temporarily disabling it but it would be a lot more convenient
-------------------------
block
it has a "pause function" (and it's not hidden or something, it's one of the main features!); you can click "whitelist" on a page, and disconnect will stop blocking trackers for that domain. to "unpause" disconnect on that domain, you just click "blacklist" (the text "whitelist" that you initially click to unblock a site will change to "blacklist" after you click it, meaning that, if you click it now, you're blocking the trackers for that site which you had earlier unblocked)
-------------------------
block
The extension has a least impact on the web-browser's performance & compliments the 'snappy' characteristic of Google Chrome. Would have liked even more had they discontinued their recurring donation window.Cleaning the web-browser's entire history makes it re-appear again & again! Lets see if go ahead to block Auto-playing Videos too in the time to come!?..though I would not reckon the feature at the cost of its slick performance! Thank you.

Very good so far. No speed problems or conflicts for me. So far have only run into one site that was made non-functional by this plugin, and that was a business type of site, where you have to be logged in in order to do anything. I was able to tell Disconnect to let the site do it's thing, and then everything on that site worked, But on your average media or e-commerce website, it's blocking all kinds of things in the background.

Have been running Disconnect for a number of years. Today I started playing with Google's Inbox and after some trial and error discovered Disconnect was the culprit that caused images not to be displayed in messages. Visiting Disconnect's site I get NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID messages.  When overriding that OpenDNS is preventing me from accessing the site. What is going on? Is Disconnect safe or ...?

there really isn't a point in having uBlock Origin and Disconnect. Overkill. If you want pure adblocking use uBlock Origin and if you want malicious-ad and tracker blocking then use Disconnect.

It blocks ads, so maybe thats why its hard to find a provider

It work a̲l̲m̲o̲s̲t̲ as advertised, it did help with protecting my privacy, but made my browsing ridiculously slow in the process. As slow as it was, I can only imagine what it used to be like, because they are marketing it as actually increasing your speed on the web now.

It also messed with my ad-blocker.

You might have different results, but I uninstalled it.

That just means that this extension does what it's supposed to do. Block tracking.

I was using this for some time but recently I noticed on some pages they kept reloading the page for some reason. So I tried to find out why and low and behold when i disabled this extension the pages that would refresh every so long stopped doing so. I had even installed an extension that prevents reloading/refreshing pages and it didn't sop it but disabling this ext. did so pretty sure it is the cause. No idea why it would cause pages to reload so I am removing this addon because of that.

Seems pretty effective, but what if someone actually prefers to have some of the trackers allowed by default? Personally I find Google's tracking mostly useful (so would like it allowed). Currently I'd have to unblock it on a site by site basis, which is a bit stupid. Would it be possible to have some general options on this related to what should or shouldn't be blocked by default?
-------------------------
block
It's rather faulty. For example, it can't block anything by google on google sites, which is annoying (doubleclick and such sneak through to Youtube).
But most importantly it just seems to be flat-out missing some malicious ads which nearly got my computer just now. The blacklist is not nearly strong enough.

Also, why can't I block some of the things that show up on the visualizer?

Very, very sadly, I might have to go back to Ghostery and sell my soul to an ad company again... Better than being unprotected against viruses.

You don't understand, "A Google User". The antivirus is the last resort, and it often fails. I'm looking to block attacks before they happen. (And as it turns out, Chrome's framework doesn't really allow this as well, unlike Firefox)

> I have to disable it on many sites, for example galleries on vanityfair are not working

Understanding why this happens requires an understanding of why corporations use slideshows. They use them because every time you click to see the next picture it counts as a page load. Each page load is an ad impression. They get paid for each ad impression. That's why they break articles down into tiny pieces so you have to keep clicking to get the next tiny piece. That's also why the galleries don't work with this extension enabled: The extension is doing its job of blocking ad impressions.

A great extension! Reduced strain on bandwidth, and blocked trackers really well.

Major problem was that it blocked widgets/scripts by default on some sites, and that took a while to whitelist.

Doesn't block just advertising and tracking, also blocks useful functionality.

For example, some sites allow me to subscribe to their newsletter, and the widget is blocked (Mailchimp widget)

It did initially seem to interfere with Google Photos but I resolved that by whitelisting the site. You can tune what it blocks, which may help you with problems on certain sites.

Ad tech is catching up to this. Some websites will block access to their video players if they detect this extension.

Excellent extension, blocks most ads and saves me the effort of ignoring them.

However, I recently purchased an Acer Chromebook 13 which is powered by an Tegra K1. Disconnect seems to decrease performance by quite a lot. Maybe increase support for ARM processors?

When this extension is ON, some photos are blocked in LiveJournal's posts. It seems that Disconnect blocks photos hosted in Yandex service (url - https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/...).

Better than AdBlock! This extension has really sped up my browsing when visiting advert-laden sites like CNET and Forbes. It doesn't necessarily block all ads, but instead the many connections to 3rd party sites that really slow your browser down.

The only down side is that occasionally you will find steaming video players on certain sites will not load the video. This happens when the video player its self is referencing 3rd party sites. When this happens, you simply click the Disconnect button on Chrome and tell it to allow all connections for this site. Two clicks...very easy and worth the small inconvenience. Disconnect also remembers your preference for sites so you only need to do this once.

Effective at blocking trackers but with several flaws: 1- Cannot be temporarily disabled from within the application - have to go to Chrome's extensions page. 2- Does not provide a way to see which websites have been white listed or blacklisted. 3- Once a website has been white listed it cannot be un-white listed. The only other choice is to blacklist it. Vice versa for a blacklisted website. 4- Allows requests from Facebook when Facebook is explicitly blocked.

Edit: After further research, it was discovered this was due to the Chrome Proxy Compression compressing images thus making them unrecognisable, not Disconnect.

Didn't doing anything noticeable apart from block certain aspects of a site loading (like buttons etc.).

What I did notice is that it stopped me downloading images. Any image that I had clicked "save image as" and saved was corrupt and couldn't be opened in any program.

After working out which one of the many extensions it was causing the issue, I worked out it was this.

Now, if there was no issue with saving images I would have this extension as I like more privacy on the internet, however with the added corrupt image bug I will not be keeping this extension installed.

Like others have mentioned, blocks flash videos from playing.  Used to work fine but now breaks too many websites.
-------------------------
block
There is a problem with the extension breaking functionality on enough sites that I am considering uninstalling it. I run into numerous problems with comment systems and video playback for the most part, but the biggest issue is that sometimes it isn't obvious that something is missing as there is not any indication on the page of what might not be there - it just tends to be blank where some element on the page should have appeared, so you might not realize how much is missing.  
   

I like the idea and it seems to block a lot of things, but it loses some utility for me because there are certain sites that I ALWAYS want to connect to as I comment on many sites that I want tied together through one account.  If there were a way to list sites as whitelisted or Blacklisted without being ON that site, it would be an improvement as well as being able to grant a free pass to FB and Twitter and G+ or other social networking sites that you want to connect with most of the time. It is tiresome to have to unblock these each and every time I visit a new place when I know that I want them to have access by default.

EDIT >> Have concluded reluctantly that it is too much interference with function and had to remove it.  Most notably it breaks the comments sections under far too many different sites and  the video playback as well.  I'd taken it off the browser only to put it back when things were slow to load (so it does  help speed of loading), however the frustrations with the videos not working and the comment sections all showing up as empty rather than blocked meant that it had to go.  Adblock may be a better solution for the load times.  Too bad  as it was a nice idea.
-------------------------
block
Websites with embedded videos, login forms, etc stop working with disconnect.

It does list what service has been blocked but it seems it does block much more than it shows. Because if i whitelist a site - which means disable disconnect at all for the given domain - then embedded videos, comments, oauth logins begin to work again.

sorry but noscript is by far much better to gether with adblock plus.

Edit - OK, people have to make a living and I was considering making a donation when I did a re-install. BUT..... Jun 2014

They've now started doing pop-ups with their own news messages.  

They block internet annoyances, only to replace them with their own!!

This app should be doing its thing and removing internet annoyance, without having to put up with Disconnect themselves making annoyance.

Apps like disconnect appeal because they (should) sit quietly in the corner and get on with it. The moment they stop doing that - their core function is spoilt.

I used to like it. Now it popped up and said a certain website is not covered any more. Well, it's a pretty big one that I wanted it to cover so that's not good. It also doesn't seem to block hardly anything compared to what it used to. Not sure what they did, but I wish they would make it what it used to be. Someone said it crashes flash...is that what has been doing that to me?

Yep, NAGWARE!!!

What's the point in blocking someone else's crap if you're just going to replace it with your own.

THIS IS NOT NAGWARE NOT ADWARE AND A LEGIT PLUGIN!!! Just like any other ad blocking program it can block and stop certain things from working, which is why there is a whitelist and your browser has a option to turn it off an on easily, the amount of moronic comments here are incredible. You blame a program you installed to block ads and popups, from blocking a pop up. It is up to you the user to know what these plug ins do. 

That said this can be somewhat buggy in terms of how much of a memory hog it can be in comparison to how much adblock plus can use. I'd recommend going with one over the other, unless you have users who are insistent of clicking things they should not.

The premise seems great (especially the increased speed in loading pages), but the workarounds I have to do while using it makes it not worth it for me.

I read the review and was excited, but, it has a nasty habit of blocking sites that I really need like WeTransfer.

The help screens poor. And the uninstall incomplete. Signed Unplugged and Unhappy.

This is a great extension and I believe everyone should install it.  One unfortunate side effect, however, is if you block Google, it won't let you log in to multiple Google accounts.  I had to unblock Google to make this work.  Hopefully, there will be a fix for this in the future.

People, remember one thing!! You will NEVER  find a anti-tracking extension or whatsoever on chrome web store. it is all fake, and when a st*pid extension tells you it blocked this and that, it doesnt mean it really did.  even if it "does" stops sites from tracking you, google is not one of them. you will "always" be tracked by google. An apple is never gonna be a pear, straight will never turn gay, gay will always stay gay, evil is never gonna be good, google will always be google. :P

Seems to have been a great extension, however in the last week it has started to effect ebay.  The problem is ebay looses it's page formatting, turning it into what looks like a HTML text mode, with some large arrow shaped graphics and picture down the bottom of the page.  First spotted this on 10th Oct 2020 on a friends machine and it has now happened on one of my machines.  Problem stops when disconnect is removed from Chrome, I added it again and the problems returned.  Would be good if you could fix this.

It's effective, but does NOT make sites load faster. In fact, it makes my computer as a whole run slower. I suspect this is due to the shift in activity on the internet to being social media and ad driven. So many sites rely on these feature that it can cause a slow down as this extension gets bogged down analyzing requests. Any which way, I saw a significant drop in CPU activity after turning off this extension. I like what it's capable of, but it just can't cut it for some reason.

Thanks, the issue is resolved. Disconnect seems to be one of the best Tracker Blockers out there, but man oh man is it aggressive.

Although I like this extension because it gives me a visual of all of the sites that are tracking me when I am browsing -- but it doesn't block trackers! 

Unfortunately, it doesn't actually appear to be stopping them from tracking me. I tested it on several privacy test websites including panopticlick and others, it does not appear to block trackers. That is disappointing, as I always thought it did. 

I will keep it for when I want to view the list of trackers, but I don't plan on using it. Test it yourself -- don't just take its word that it is blocking tracking.
-------------------------
stop
it has a "pause function" (and it's not hidden or something, it's one of the main features!); you can click "whitelist" on a page, and disconnect will stop blocking trackers for that domain. to "unpause" disconnect on that domain, you just click "blacklist" (the text "whitelist" that you initially click to unblock a site will change to "blacklist" after you click it, meaning that, if you click it now, you're blocking the trackers for that site which you had earlier unblocked)

It gives errors because they're both doing the same thing.  One extension is just doing it sooner than the other and that's where the error is.

No need to uninstall, just deal with there being an error since neither performance is actually affected.

Great browser extension for stopping those pesky tracking-cookies :)

What happened to the Disconnect search extension? Maybe it is not available in my region anymore );
-------------------------
stop
I was using this for some time but recently I noticed on some pages they kept reloading the page for some reason. So I tried to find out why and low and behold when i disabled this extension the pages that would refresh every so long stopped doing so. I had even installed an extension that prevents reloading/refreshing pages and it didn't sop it but disabling this ext. did so pretty sure it is the cause. No idea why it would cause pages to reload so I am removing this addon because of that.

> I have to disable it on many sites, for example galleries on vanityfair are not working

Understanding why this happens requires an understanding of why corporations use slideshows. They use them because every time you click to see the next picture it counts as a page load. Each page load is an ad impression. They get paid for each ad impression. That's why they break articles down into tiny pieces so you have to keep clicking to get the next tiny piece. That's also why the galleries don't work with this extension enabled: The extension is doing its job of blocking ad impressions.
-------------------------
error
I've been using Disconnect for a year now without any issue, but as of late I've receiving a ton of extension errors, saying that they're is a connection to server issue? Just started happening at the start of the new year.

Ad tech is catching up to this. Some websites will block access to their video players if they detect this extension.

Extension is great in most respects, but it breaks the new Google Photos, and so I'm disabling it for now.

Only thing is that it interferes with video playback. If I disable it the video plays. Weird bug.

I have been using for about a year.  Chrome became more and more buggy when considering playback of certain video plug-ins and simple jpeg displays.  Using a method of trial and error with extensions, I narrowed the problem to Disconnect.  With it un-enabled and all else the same, everything displays as it should.
-------------------------
load
Better than AdBlock! This extension has really sped up my browsing when visiting advert-laden sites like CNET and Forbes. It doesn't necessarily block all ads, but instead the many connections to 3rd party sites that really slow your browser down.

The only down side is that occasionally you will find steaming video players on certain sites will not load the video. This happens when the video player its self is referencing 3rd party sites. When this happens, you simply click the Disconnect button on Chrome and tell it to allow all connections for this site. Two clicks...very easy and worth the small inconvenience. Disconnect also remembers your preference for sites so you only need to do this once.
-------------------------
load
It might do what it's supposed to, but makes my browser much slower to respond; to load web pages.
-------------------------
break
Breaks too many sites by blocking the wrong type of scripts.
-------------------------
bug
Edit: After further research, it was discovered this was due to the Chrome Proxy Compression compressing images thus making them unrecognisable, not Disconnect.

Didn't doing anything noticeable apart from block certain aspects of a site loading (like buttons etc.).

What I did notice is that it stopped me downloading images. Any image that I had clicked "save image as" and saved was corrupt and couldn't be opened in any program.

After working out which one of the many extensions it was causing the issue, I worked out it was this.

Now, if there was no issue with saving images I would have this extension as I like more privacy on the internet, however with the added corrupt image bug I will not be keeping this extension installed.
-------------------------
stop
This is the world best extension I have seen. It stop all the tracker include the trackers on the startup page of Google Chrome. I am really impressed with this extension. I want to suggest that if you want an privacy extension you must have to have this. This best extension is Disconnet.

A must have extension (IMO). This + an ad blocker make websites load clean. The extremely rare ads that still make it to my  browser are not targeted anymore based on my searches or sites visited.

break
Like others have mentioned, blocks flash videos from playing.  Used to work fine but now breaks too many websites.
-------------------------
stop
Others have mentioned it, but I'm mentioning it again. The extension creates more havoc than it should.

It doesn't allow you to whitelist sites before you go to the site. So when you first visit your own site and find missing elements, you try fixing why those elements are missing. I've spent hours on my sites, only to eventually open them in a different browser and finding them to work perfect.

We won't talk about all the requests to donate. While I hate them (especially from an app that's made to stop others from doing similar actions), it's the seemingly random blockage of elements that makes this extension one to stay away from!

The only people that should install this extension are those that are so paranoid they shouldn't be on the Internet in the first place! All others stay away (if nothing else, for your own sanity).
-------------------------
break
There is a problem with the extension breaking functionality on enough sites that I am considering uninstalling it. I run into numerous problems with comment systems and video playback for the most part, but the biggest issue is that sometimes it isn't obvious that something is missing as there is not any indication on the page of what might not be there - it just tends to be blank where some element on the page should have appeared, so you might not realize how much is missing.  
   

I like the idea and it seems to block a lot of things, but it loses some utility for me because there are certain sites that I ALWAYS want to connect to as I comment on many sites that I want tied together through one account.  If there were a way to list sites as whitelisted or Blacklisted without being ON that site, it would be an improvement as well as being able to grant a free pass to FB and Twitter and G+ or other social networking sites that you want to connect with most of the time. It is tiresome to have to unblock these each and every time I visit a new place when I know that I want them to have access by default.

EDIT >> Have concluded reluctantly that it is too much interference with function and had to remove it.  Most notably it breaks the comments sections under far too many different sites and  the video playback as well.  I'd taken it off the browser only to put it back when things were slow to load (so it does  help speed of loading), however the frustrations with the videos not working and the comment sections all showing up as empty rather than blocked meant that it had to go.  Adblock may be a better solution for the load times.  Too bad  as it was a nice idea.
-------------------------
stop
Websites with embedded videos, login forms, etc stop working with disconnect.

It does list what service has been blocked but it seems it does block much more than it shows. Because if i whitelist a site - which means disable disconnect at all for the given domain - then embedded videos, comments, oauth logins begin to work again.

sorry but noscript is by far much better to gether with adblock plus.
-------------------------
stop
Was good - May 2014 has now become NAGWARE.  

Edit - OK, people have to make a living and I was considering making a donation when I did a re-install. BUT..... Jun 2014

They've now started doing pop-ups with their own news messages.  

They block internet annoyances, only to replace them with their own!!

This app should be doing its thing and removing internet annoyance, without having to put up with Disconnect themselves making annoyance.

Apps like disconnect appeal because they (should) sit quietly in the corner and get on with it. The moment they stop doing that - their core function is spoilt.
-------------------------
stop
The developer also had a similar extension called collusion for chrome they've suddenly stopped supporting. I hope they aren't trying to make us use this instead because I had to disable it due to too many issues with things I *want* to work!
-------------------------
stop
A donation is mandatory to stop annoying messages.

Disconnec.me's FAQ indicates that the donation to stop the messages will be required every time you need to reinstall the extension, install it in other browsers, or on new devices.

From their FAQ:

Why does the payments page sometimes come up if I’ve already paid?
Even if you’ve paid us, you will still see our payment page if you ever have to re-install the software, or install on a different browser or device. If you’d rather not pay again, please just ignore the page and click out of the window.
-------------------------
load
UPDATE: After I wrote that I had FOUR reminders to pay today and the fifth is actually demand wanting me to give them suggested amounts and even make it annual (which I think is harrassment), I got a nice letter from the Disconnect people saying the frequency was unintended. 

However, I've been using  Ghostery for days and I must say my pages are loading faster.
-------------------------
stop
THIS IS NOT NAGWARE NOT ADWARE AND A LEGIT PLUGIN!!! Just like any other ad blocking program it can block and stop certain things from working, which is why there is a whitelist and your browser has a option to turn it off an on easily, the amount of moronic comments here are incredible. You blame a program you installed to block ads and popups, from blocking a pop up. It is up to you the user to know what these plug ins do. 

That said this can be somewhat buggy in terms of how much of a memory hog it can be in comparison to how much adblock plus can use. I'd recommend going with one over the other, unless you have users who are insistent of clicking things they should not.
-------------------------

I had this installed for some time, but lately it has been slowing my system down. Every time something was loading slowly in my Chrome browser on my Chromebook, the status message was "waiting for Disconnect to load" something like that. As soon as I disabled this extension my system returned to normal. I've had this happen before, so for now I'm leaving it disabled.

I love this app but it breaks certain aspects of flash functionality. Please fix this and I'll rate it five stars.

EDIT 1/8/14: Now all embedded flash videos (may be limited to YouTube) are broken and Disconnect is the culprit! I can't use it right now, fix this please!

I like this app big time.
Problem I do experience:

The extension needs more fine-grained control over what hosts trigger the proxied search. Otherwise, this breaks many Google integrations, like Maps reviews. It's fine if you don't want someone snooping on your Google searches for whatever reason, but other than that, it can get in the way.

Denying load of chrome-extension://jeoacafpbcihiomhlakheieifhpjdfeo/scripts/vendor/jquery/jquery-2.0.3.min.map. Resources must be listed in the web_accessible_resources manifest key in order to be loaded by pages outside the extension. Please fix it! That annoys me.
-------------------------
break
The premise seems great (especially the increased speed in loading pages), but the workarounds I have to do while using it makes it not worth it for me.

As others have pointed out, the extension breaks some bookmarklets (e.g. Pinterest) and it also prevents some login forms from working (e.g. Khan Academy's if you sign in via Facebook).

I found a thread where someone was complaining about ad blockers slowing Chrome down and saw someone suggest Disconnect. Wow!!!

It seems to do its job well, but it completely breaks Facebook's photo upload feature and tweaking picture thumbnails on your timeline. To fix this, the entire Disconnect extension must be disabled; putting Facebook on Disconnect's whitelist will not be enough. Keep this in mind before downloading.

I used this for a long, long time.  Within the last couple weeks, I started noticing that Google Reader was, when clicking a link, redirecting to the SSL secured google homepage instead of going to some of the sites I read.  I found Disconnect was causing the issue by disabling all my extensions and adding them back one by one until it broke.  Perhaps it just needs an update... I don't recall if it broke following a Chrome update or not, though I do recall one installing recently.

People, remember one thing!! You will NEVER  find a anti-tracking extension or whatsoever on chrome web store. it is all fake, and when a st*pid extension tells you it blocked this and that, it doesnt mean it really did.  even if it "does" stops sites from tracking you, google is not one of them. you will "always" be tracked by google. An apple is never gonna be a pear, straight will never turn gay, gay will always stay gay, evil is never gonna be good, google will always be google. :P

It's effective, but does NOT make sites load faster. In fact, it makes my computer as a whole run slower. I suspect this is due to the shift in activity on the internet to being social media and ad driven. So many sites rely on these feature that it can cause a slow down as this extension gets bogged down analyzing requests. Any which way, I saw a significant drop in CPU activity after turning off this extension. I like what it's capable of, but it just can't cut it for some reason.

I'd taken it off the browser only to put it back when things were slow to load (so it does  help speed of loading), however the frustrations with the videos not working and the comment sections all showing up as empty rather than blocked meant that it had to go.  Adblock may be a better solution for the load times.  Too bad  as it was a nice idea.

THIS IS NOT NAGWARE NOT ADWARE AND A LEGIT PLUGIN!!! Just like any other ad blocking program it can block and stop certain things from working, which is why there is a whitelist and your browser has a option to turn it off an on easily, the amount of moronic comments here are incredible. You blame a program you installed to block ads and popups, from blocking a pop up. It is up to you the user to know what these plug ins do. 

That said this can be somewhat buggy in terms of how much of a memory hog it can be in comparison to how much adblock plus can use. I'd recommend going with one over the other, unless you have users who are insistent of clicking things they should not.

Great concept, but no settings to override for certain sites. - e.g. if I use Google or Facebook to sign in to other sites, then I actually *don't* want that connection severed. Other than that, didn't notice any difference in my browsing. Only use if your fear and loathing of FB, Google etc is intense. I'm turning it off.

Thanks, the issue is resolved. Disconnect seems to be one of the best Tracker Blockers out there, but man oh man is it aggressive. A lot of other extensions and websites just stopped working after installing this extension.

You open Youtube. 0 is shown against all categories in list view. You switch to visualisation. Many connections are showing. You don;t check the lot but one of these is doubleclick - a notorious tracker. It is unblocked. You give up and chase a blocker that works!

Um, Doubleclick is owned by google, that's how they serve ads? It's not a notorious tracker it's Google's ad serving platform. Yes you could block it with some of the ad blockers. Google did announce re branding of Doubleclick tho, dunno what their plans with it are.

My advice is: 
1. Use Disconnect and some AdBlocker
2. Update your HOSTS file (just google how to do it).
You can download maintaned list of variuos ad platforms/redirect ad/affiliate networks/ malicious sites to put into your HOSTS file (thus blocking it — basically by putting www.somesite.com 0.0.0.0 (or 127.0.0.1 aka the loopback ip) you tell your system to ignore the DNS server and use HOSTS file and thus redirect said unwanted site back to non-routable meta-address (0.0.0.0) or loopback (locahost) so it doesn't resolve.
That's super effective way of blocking stuff.

Here's some links for maintaned HOSTS files:
https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/ aka "How to make the Internet not suck (as much)" and
http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm  by Winhelp

Alternatively you could use those two and autoupdate the hosts file with a script such as:
https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
Steven Black's script uses both data from someonewhocares and MVPS and few others (malwaredomainlist etc). 

All sites I mentioned are free, they are doing great work and they update lists of malicious sites regularly.

Hope this helps.

That isn't a false positive, Google's login popup is a tracker and as such is blocked. Same goes for Facebook and any other OpenID login. If you want to whitelist Google then you can login, if not then make an account on the site without using an OpenID like Google or Facebook.

Disconnect was working well up until Chrome version 65, specifically Version 65.0.3325.162 (Official Build) (64-bit) on Windows 10 build 1709. Now Disconnect causes Chrome in all channels/versions (stable, beta, and canary) to crash consistently when I go to several specific sites, including marriott.com and delta.com. Yep, of course I whitelisted those sites in the Disconnect extension settings but Chrome still crashes every time. One could argue that it's the sites that are at fault, not Disconnect, but guess what I have control over? Deactivating the Disconnect extension. I completely uninstalled Chrome, including all of the settings files, rebooted my PC, and reinstalled Chrome, I deleted all cache and cookies, etc. None of that helped - crashes still happen. I disable Disconnect, no crash. I reactivate Disconnect, crashes come right back. I travel a lot so this is a deal-breaker for me.

Although I like this extension because it gives me a visual of all of the sites that are tracking me when I am browsing -- but it doesn't block trackers! 

Unfortunately, it doesn't actually appear to be stopping them from tracking me. I tested it on several privacy test websites including panopticlick and others, it does not appear to block trackers. That is disappointing, as I always thought it did. 

I will keep it for when I want to view the list of trackers, but I don't plan on using it. Test it yourself -- don't just take its word that it is blocking tracking.
-------------------------
whitelist
it has a "pause function" (and it's not hidden or something, it's one of the main features!); you can click "whitelist" on a page, and disconnect will stop blocking trackers for that domain. to "unpause" disconnect on that domain, you just click "blacklist" (the text "whitelist" that you initially click to unblock a site will change to "blacklist" after you click it, meaning that, if you click it now, you're blocking the trackers for that site which you had earlier unblocked)
-------------------------

You can whitelist the specific site, which will allow the site to function normally. Visit the Google Calendar page, then (left) click on the Disconnect icon on the toolbar > select "Whitelist Site" from the Disconnect menu - all better.

It's rather faulty. For example, it can't block anything by google on google sites, which is annoying (doubleclick and such sneak through to Youtube).
But most importantly it just seems to be flat-out missing some malicious ads which nearly got my computer just now. The blacklist is not nearly strong enough.

Also, why can't I block some of the things that show up on the visualizer?

Very, very sadly, I might have to go back to Ghostery and sell my soul to an ad company again... Better than being unprotected against viruses.

I hate Disqus because of its tracking - it stores everything you ever said on any website!  Go to their page and take a look at your own info.  Really SCARY what it knows about you.

It's a nice extension... but after whitelisting a lot of sites temporarily to display content there's no way to see a list of all the sites of white/blacklisted which is pretty stupid.

Effective at blocking trackers but with several flaws: 1- Cannot be temporarily disabled from within the application - have to go to Chrome's extensions page. 2- Does not provide a way to see which websites have been white listed or blacklisted. 3- Once a website has been white listed it cannot be un-white listed. The only other choice is to blacklist it. Vice versa for a blacklisted website. 4- Allows requests from Facebook when Facebook is explicitly blocked.

Others have mentioned it, but I'm mentioning it again. The extension creates more havoc than it should.

It doesn't allow you to whitelist sites before you go to the site. So when you first visit your own site and find missing elements, you try fixing why those elements are missing. I've spent hours on my sites, only to eventually open them in a different browser and finding them to work perfect.

We won't talk about all the requests to donate. While I hate them (especially from an app that's made to stop others from doing similar actions), it's the seemingly random blockage of elements that makes this extension one to stay away from!

The only people that should install this extension are those that are so paranoid they shouldn't be on the Internet in the first place! All others stay away (if nothing else, for your own sanity).
-------------------------
list
There is a problem with the extension breaking functionality on enough sites that I am considering uninstalling it. I run into numerous problems with comment systems and video playback for the most part, but the biggest issue is that sometimes it isn't obvious that something is missing as there is not any indication on the page of what might not be there - it just tends to be blank where some element on the page should have appeared, so you might not realize how much is missing.  
   

I like the idea and it seems to block a lot of things, but it loses some utility for me because there are certain sites that I ALWAYS want to connect to as I comment on many sites that I want tied together through one account.  If there were a way to list sites as whitelisted or Blacklisted without being ON that site, it would be an improvement as well as being able to grant a free pass to FB and Twitter and G+ or other social networking sites that you want to connect with most of the time. It is tiresome to have to unblock these each and every time I visit a new place when I know that I want them to have access by default.

EDIT >> Have concluded reluctantly that it is too much interference with function and had to remove it.  Most notably it breaks the comments sections under far too many different sites and  the video playback as well.

Websites with embedded videos, login forms, etc stop working with disconnect.

It does list what service has been blocked but it seems it does block much more than it shows. Because if i whitelist a site - which means disable disconnect at all for the given domain - then embedded videos, comments, oauth logins begin to work again.

sorry but noscript is by far much better to gether with adblock plus.

A very important little extension. The only issue I think i'm having with it is with the 'use https if available' feature. I think it interferes with FlashControl, which (probably) cannot filter content on https pages. For me that means that content on youtube pages starts loading/playing immediately, while I'd like to be able to activate the flash player only when I really want it (as I often keep pages open for later).
Maybe the devs could add a (white)listing feature for sites that don't require automatic https switching?

Thank you Majik Bear for explaining the way this extension functions. After reading this I finally understood why Chrome's functionality was disabled in a lot of ways. Apparently I must have added this extension to Chrome at some point and after that I was unable to see sildeshows, unable to download CC and Bank statements, unable to see online bills, and a lot more. It, basically, crippled Chrome for me and I had to resort to using.... IE on Windows... Impossible situation, in other words. I guess, what I disliked is the fact that this extension functioned properly and well. But the real issue is that Majik Bear's explanation of March 3, 2016 should be posted in the overview of this extension to allow people to understand what browser functionalities will be lost and, better yet, add a clear explanation as to why, why this extension is important.

Better than AdBlock! This extension has really sped up my browsing when visiting advert-laden sites like CNET and Forbes. It doesn't necessarily block all ads, but instead the many connections to 3rd party sites that really slow your browser down.

The only down side is that occasionally you will find steaming video players on certain sites will not load the video. This happens when the video player its self is referencing 3rd party sites. When this happens, you simply click the Disconnect button on Chrome and tell it to allow all connections for this site. Two clicks...very easy and worth the small inconvenience. Disconnect also remembers your preference for sites so you only need to do this once.

A donation is mandatory to stop annoying messages.

Disconnec.me's FAQ indicates that the donation to stop the messages will be required every time you need to reinstall the extension, install it in other browsers, or on new devices.

Why does the payments page sometimes come up if I’ve already paid?
Even if you’ve paid us, you will still see our payment page if you ever have to re-install the software, or install on a different browser or device. If you’d rather not pay again, please just ignore the page and click out of the window.

slow
It's effective, but does NOT make sites load faster. In fact, it makes my computer as a whole run slower. I suspect this is due to the shift in activity on the internet to being social media and ad driven. So many sites rely on these feature that it can cause a slow down as this extension gets bogged down analyzing requests. Any which way, I saw a significant drop in CPU activity after turning off this extension. I like what it's capable of, but it just can't cut it for some reason.
-------------------------
light
Wish it had a dedicated settings page. Either something like AdGuard or AdBlock Plus. I really just like using this for its diagram, however it is impossible to disable the extension blocking feature globally and seems to only work site by site. That way one could view the "light beam" spider web of connections and seem how other extensions are working.

I've have had this installed about 8 months. About once I day my laptop heats up, maxes out the fan, and drains its battery within minutes. Every time I find it's some Chrome process hogging 120% CPU. Every time I kill it, it's Disconnect reporting it's been terminated.

The only thing I've found this to "speed up" so far is how quickly I need to recharge. Maybe Windows users are luckier.
-------------------------
speed
Very good so far. No speed problems or conflicts for me. So far have only run into one site that was made non-functional by this plugin, and that was a business type of site, where you have to be logged in in order to do anything. I was able to tell Disconnect to let the site do it's thing, and then everything on that site worked, But on your average media or e-commerce website, it's blocking all kinds of things in the background.

It work a̲l̲m̲o̲s̲t̲ as advertised, it did help with protecting my privacy, but made my browsing ridiculously slow in the process. As slow as it was, I can only imagine what it used to be like, because they are marketing it as actually increasing your speed on the web now.

It also messed with my ad-blocker.

You might have different results, but I uninstalled it.

Try using  Facebook Disconnect. This seems to work, have not had probs with it so far, though Facebook still slows my browser down no matter I am using a Linux machine or Windblows. I just make sure I sign off FB and not just close the tab because it will keep you signed in otherwise.

Better than AdBlock! This extension has really sped up my browsing when visiting advert-laden sites like CNET and Forbes. It doesn't necessarily block all ads, but instead the many connections to 3rd party sites that really slow your browser down.

The only down side is that occasionally you will find steaming video players on certain sites will not load the video. This happens when the video player its self is referencing 3rd party sites. When this happens, you simply click the Disconnect button on Chrome and tell it to allow all connections for this site. Two clicks...very easy and worth the small inconvenience. Disconnect also remembers your preference for sites so you only need to do this once.
-------------------------
slow
There is a problem with the extension breaking functionality on enough sites that I am considering uninstalling it. I run into numerous problems with comment systems and video playback for the most part, but the biggest issue is that sometimes it isn't obvious that something is missing as there is not any indication on the page of what might not be there - it just tends to be blank where some element on the page should have appeared, so you might not realize how much is missing.  
   

I like the idea and it seems to block a lot of things, but it loses some utility for me because there are certain sites that I ALWAYS want to connect to as I comment on many sites that I want tied together through one account.  If there were a way to list sites as whitelisted or Blacklisted without being ON that site, it would be an improvement as well as being able to grant a free pass to FB and Twitter and G+ or other social networking sites that you want to connect with most of the time. It is tiresome to have to unblock these each and every time I visit a new place when I know that I want them to have access by default.

EDIT >> Have concluded reluctantly that it is too much interference with function and had to remove it.  Most notably it breaks the comments sections under far too many different sites and  the video playback as well.  I'd taken it off the browser only to put it back when things were slow to load (so it does  help speed of loading), however the frustrations with the videos not working and the comment sections all showing up as empty rather than blocked meant that it had to go.  Adblock may be a better solution for the load times.  Too bad  as it was a nice idea.
-------------------------

Used to be decent but now it slows down my browser, messes with flash movies, crashes chrome a lot, and it even lagged my whole computer until I ctrl+alt+del chrome. Will not recommend.

It blocks the google cloud console and sometimes makes other web-sites slow.

I had this installed for some time, but lately it has been slowing my system down. Every time something was loading slowly in my Chrome browser on my Chromebook, the status message was "waiting for Disconnect to load" something like that. As soon as I disabled this extension my system returned to normal. I've had this happen before, so for now I'm leaving it disabled.

insane cpu usage!!
-------------------------
speed
The premise seems great (especially the increased speed in loading pages), but the workarounds I have to do while using it makes it not worth it for me.

As others have pointed out, the extension breaks some bookmarklets (e.g. Pinterest) and it also prevents some login forms from working (e.g. Khan Academy's if you sign in via Facebook).
-------------------------
slow
It works as advertised but slows everything down. It's like having a telephone connection.  Just not worth it for me.
-------------------------
slow
I have tried all the ad blockers and they all slow Chrome down and you can't scroll some pages until they fully load. I found a thread where someone was complaining about ad blockers slowing Chrome down and saw someone suggest Disconnect. Wow!!! One page I go to daily takes 8secs to load with no ad blocker, 9.5 with all of the other ad blockers and 0.7secs with Disconnect! I think it's time to make a donation.

I know that maybe many had pointed out this, but when I open Mefiafire it keeps blocking facebook and makes my computer really slow. In the mean time I have fb unblocked just for that site.

That's just an small issue, everything else works flawlesly!
-------------------------
slow
I've used this extension before, with no problems, but it seems that when I recently installed it, it tends to slow my computer down whenever I go to Mediafire. I noticed the other day that everytime I go there, the notifications just start to rise at an extremely rapid pace. In less than a minute, I'll get over 9000 notifications from the extension just from that website a lone, which in turn slows my entire computer down. I hope there's a way around this soon. :/

Reviews don't know what they are talking about, it breaks many website logins such as google login on Indeed.com and many other websites.  Privacy Badger blocks stuff automatically but it is coded in such a way that it breaks many things not just Google stuff but other stuff as well that is needed to make certain functions on a website to run.  It needs to be configured to know to not block font.gstatic and many other google trackers as it claims aswell.  Unfortunately privacy badger has had this problem for over a year now if not 1+ years and has not been fixed so I would advice to use contentblockhelper extension as that does not block things by default but allows you to choose what to block and it finds every single possible thing on the webpage it even finds the type of font a webpage uses that you disable.  What is nice is you can click the black + and then see what is under a certain category and then tap one of the green + of whatever you choose to disable, if you choose to renable what you blocked you then tap the red - to renabled it and then refresh the webpage.  Last but not least it remembers all websites changes you made so you never have to redo what you have disabled and/or enabled.  Privacy badger is such hot garbage and I would not be surprised if Google owns it and is also making fake reviews on here with 5 stars.  Word to the wise:  Don't believe many reviews nowadays as most of them are fake including responses from people stating what you wrote isn't true or critiquing you about why you would think that and so forth, I believe these to either be bots or people who are not Knowledgeable about extensions, but not me I know what works and what doesn't by using it, I don't trust people anymore as most of are defiantly lying or they are a bot.
-------------------------
block
Of course it works if you enabled it, It works to well, it blocks many things on website and ruins the functionality of it.  I had to disable it to login to my Indeed account as it would have took longer to click on most of the stuff it blocked to enable it again via the slider.  I just sent a report to privacy badger but I am not holding my breath as they have never fixed these problems for over a year at least now.  I am uninstalling this and going back to the tried and true working "contentblockhelper".

If you want the web to not work right, then this is the tool to achieve that goal.

You'll spend hours scratching your head as to why a spinning icon is appearing over something as simple as Amazon Pay boxes on a website implementing Amazon's payment system before you realise that this extension is causing it - sometimes you forget to check this extension and waste a lot of time and refreshing trying to make a website work.

For example: I seen the Amazon "sign in" pop up window after checking out on a website. I signed in OK, but then the "select a card and address" section wouldn't load. This extension was blocking payments.amazon.com and payments.amazon.co.uk. What kind of stupidity is this?
-------------------------
block
My internet experience in general seems to have improved since installing Privacy Badger. It is not high maintenance at all as some have claimed.  It just sits there quietly, doing its thing for the most part.

I've been receiving a lot of spam lately from overseas.  I know it is because they are somehow reading my browser history because they always contain my recent key search words.  I don't have a lot of extensions and the ones I have are pretty benign I think.  The two I have some question about are New Tab Redirect and Stylist but I really like those two.  I am hoping that Privacy Badger will block anyone from reading my history and reduce the amount of spam I receive as a result of this exploit.
-------------------------
block
I have used this plugin for a few years now. I use it for its primary purpose: to block trackers. It's probably not the best at ad blocking. I recommend it if you wish to protect your privacy as much as you can.

The only issue I've had is that it will break forms on some sites, but it's easy enough to disable for the site you need to use.

I donate to the EFF and I hope you do too!

This extension blocks many websites' important cookies, such as qr-code when I was trying to log into my Weibo or somewhere else, which is annoying. Besides I didn't find any differences between other blocker extensions. Perhaps it's okay for its nonprofit slogan.

detect
Wouldn't "fails to detect certain kinds of tracking" have been a more accurate statement than "blatantly lies to the user about the tracking"? It seems weird to assassinate the character of a piece of software. It's just clunky when it tries to do certain jobs and has to be improved. It's not on the road to psychopathy.

You don't want to block first-level cookies on the current website; it may not function correctly. What you seek to do is block thirty party cookies--other websites--that attach themselves in your browser.

I think it's a great app in general but found an issue with adding embedded youtube videos to my 'watch later' list. If I click on 'watch later as xxx' it would pop up with an "invalid request" error message each time. I had to go through all my plug ins to figure out what was blocking this - it's a very handy feature, when I come across a YouTube video on a random site and want to watch it later I simply add it to my Watch Later list and view it when it's convenient. 

For now, I have disabled PB. Hopefully they can add a way to not block this specific feature, let the user decide... ->If there is a way that I didn't see I'd appreciate someone letting me know.
-------------------------

Used to work great, but now it doesn't block anything.  What happened?

works well for the simple stuff I do, causes bugs on some pages but all you have to do is toggle with the blocking settings so that's not a big deal.
-------------------------
block
Privacy Badger does not come with a list of domains to block. Instead, Privacy Badger watches which third-party domains appear to track you as you browse the Web. If Privacy Badger sees the same domain track you across three different sites, Privacy Badger will start blocking resources from that domain.

We are working on making the way Privacy Badger works more clear in the future.

if you use other privacy tools or ad blockers in combination with Privacy Badger, your Badger will learn to block far fewer domains. This is fine: Privacy Badger will be there to catch whatever your other blockers let through.
-------------------------
block
It basically works well but if your militant about blocking the deluge of junk being forced into your browsing experience then you may think Badger lets to much through by default. In a sense it does, as it requires you to be actively (pro-actively) adjusting the settings to suite your preferences which gets a bit tedious.

Privacy Badger new review 10/16/17

Been using this again, I like its coding, however I really think it needs a few  QOL changes...

1. The top of each row is  Block / Cookie  / Allow I want these to be clickable allow all / Block ALL Cookies, and lastly Block ALL!

I find it ridiculous I have to slide the bar on some sites 49 times to block? 


2. This one is huge, it needs a sync feature, where it be through Chrome or otherwise... I use PB on 2 computers and I have to constantly download rules from one and upload them to the other its 2017 this needs to be added ASAP!
-------------------------
block
This extension is almost perfect - it would be nice to be able to change the colour of the blocked items indicators :D
-------------------------
block
Needs a reset button.  I made a couple of selections as something wasn't working on a site but later realised I was getting loads of new ads on a different site.
No way to no which blocked cookie did it and no ability, bar going through over 30 cookies and testing each one individually.
-------------------------
block
Practically useless because it breaks so many websites.  Inexcusable as many of the blocked elements do not behave, identify, or act as ads or trackers.
-------------------------
protect
In may case everything is fine, this is a project to protect our privacy and they are improving it everyday without earning anything from us so I believe we should try to support them in every possible way.
-------------------------
block
I have been using this extension for a while, but am probably going to uninstall it and go back to using AdBlock Plus for the moment. I think PB will improve as more people install it and, hopefully, they report the problems that they find with it. As of now, it breaks too many sites for seemingly innocuous things (images are a big problem, as is video), and I don't have the time to go through upwards of 20 settings to adjust per broken site.

I really appreciate the work that has gone into developing this extension, and like I said, I presume it will improve over time if the developers look into reports users send them regarding problems with blocked sites, which, to be sure, they make very easy for a user to send them. For now, though, everything is a nail to this hammer (or, to put it more accurately, "a slew of things that aren't nails...").

For the small subset of people that may be developers out there: it also blocked get requests to a handful of external api's from localhost (took a couple of annoying minutes to realize that my code wasn't wrong).
-------------------------
block
This is easy to use and works well - too well. It is too aggressive and broke many sites I use, and the big problem is you can't always tell a site isn't working properly. It isn't always obvious that large chunks of pages just aren't there. Particular problems for me were pictures, review comments, things like that, all legitimate and not the sort of thing I would expect anything to block "out of the box". I don't have the patience to spend hours fine tuning it, so after a few weeks I uninstalled.
-------------------------
block
Yeah this was my experience too. Many many websites use legitimate external scripts, and blocking all of them by default was not workable. Maybe once more people have used it and they've been able to tune the defaults better I'll come back. (But it already says 600k users :S)
-------------------------
block
Good for peace of mind. The only problem is that when a web site seems broken, you have to remember to disable Privacy Badger for that site to see if it fixes the problem, as the way the tool works does break some sites that are designed in an unusual way. I just wish it had a *temporary* shut-off switch ("Reload without Privacy Badger"?) to help me establish if PB is the problem.

It has a side-effect of blocking some ads, which also causes some news sites to demand you disable it.
-------------------------
block
It's not inherently an ad blocker--it's a privacy protector, which sometimes has the result that it blocks ads.
-------------------------
block
The only tracking script blocking application that I trust. Thanks EFF!
-------------------------
block
It's blocking much more than it should. I DON'T want to block ads. I just don't want to be tracked. There's a difference. Now half the sites I go to don't work.
-------------------------
block
Privacy Badger used to be good but this latest update (running in Chrome 51.0.2704.103 m (64-bit), Windows 10) now saves blocking preferences alongside cookies so when you clear cookies Privacy Badger resets itself. Privacy Badger only did one thing and now it doesn’t even do that. Utterly useless and now removed from Chrome.  Also, EFF offer no support for this extension, with the ‘support site’ link taking you to a FAQ so you can’t even report this error. Doubly useless.
-------------------------
block
A great way to block trackers, whilst not impacting the revenues of those sites who're using less intrusive ads.
-------------------------
block
Like they said, it's not meant to be an ad-blocker, and I'm starting to get it. This extension must first WITNESS the trackers actually try to track you (despite Do Not Track settings) before actually deciding to block them, which makes sense. (Everything being green and allowed at first is a bit scary though...)

Unfortunately, in the current state of the web, ads can be loud, obnoxious, animated, bandwidth-eating and even infect your computer immediately just from being loaded. As such, I just feel safer with more paranoid extensions that blacklist things by default.

TL;DR: Privacy on its own doesn't ensure safety. It's okay, but not what I'm after.

Also it breaks a couple pages when it blocks things, so it could use work.
-------------------------
block
This application does the job it is designed to do very well. I am always interested in seeing the absurd number of intrusions that it has blocked in certain websites. My problem with it is that it seriously effects the working of a number of websites. In particular many websites are unable to play or load videos. While I am sure that some videos are problematic I dont believe as many as it is blocking are. The problem is that when you look at the drop down box it is impossible to see which of the elements being blocked are privacy related and which are content related. I am sure that this is somethign to do with the underlying content, but it means that bar spending 10 minutes every time I want to play a video, I simply end up turning off its protection, which defeats the point of having it in the first place. However most of the time this works without having to think about it
-------------------------
block
This has become insanely slow. When I open the options and try to make a change to blocking a site, it might take up to 60 seconds to respond after clicking one slider, and it locks up Chrome. Win10-64, i7 3.2GHz, 12GB ram, Samsung SSD.
-------------------------
prevent
Used to work really well but recently it has suffered. Regularly the extension will prevent the page from loading. You'll see a "waiting for Privacy Badger" message. I assume it's because it's grabbing external scripts somewhere. There really should be a fall back option so that if it times out the page can still load. I keep having to disable it and am close to removing. I still have hope though!
-------------------------
prevent
Works fine for a hot sec, then completely breaks Chrome.

And I don't mean just breaks certain sites, or no CSS, or whatnot, no: it prevents anything from loading at all, as if your internet faucet had suddenly been turned off.
-------------------------

Seems their servers go down a lot, blocking entire page from loading.

prevent
Half the time it works, other half it prevents any page from loading with "Waiting for Privacy badger"
-------------------------
block
good idea sloppy implementation

-no sync, import/export or similar
- not aggressive enough,  that is, it takes forever before it starts blocking even 'well-known' trackers...

But I have seen that's capable to "see" trackers and third party crap, similar programs didn't.

Bottom line:
For the time being, I would only it as a secondary privacy protection solution next to whatever you've been using already...
-------------------------
block
It may be blocking, but it breaks Facebook. Pages are rendered as an outline with links instead of formatted pages.
-------------------------
block
It has a heuristic blocker. If you visit three sites and it detects scorecard research on 3+ sites then it is blocked. 
-------------------------
protect
And surely it couldn't be possible that the companies who want to collect, sell, and use your data might be doing that on purpose, right?

It really comes down to a question of whether or not you actually want privacy, or just the false appearance of privacy so you can sleep better at night while not actually having it. If an extension is REALLY protecting you, things WILL break from time to time. Although things breaking from time to time doesn't mean you actually ARE being protected, but actually being protected DOES mean that sometimes things aren't going to work right, or at all.

Usability has always come at the expense of security (because of some people being willing to exploit you), and maximum security always comes at the expense of usability. These two things are at odds and can only coexist together through compromising one or the other.
-------------------------
block
Not quite sure how having a visible extension which enumerate which sites have been blocked is "non-visible".

If the result of using Privacy Badger is that a site you're using becomes unusable, then this is the fault of the developers of that website, not the Privacy Badger developers.
-------------------------
block
Used so many resources I couldn't get anything in chrome to react while a tab was loading in the background. (ie. closing tab, closing browser, the usual steps to kill a resource hog)  The blocking seemed to work just fine, but I can't wait >15 seconds to load each webpage on a 2015 Macbook Pro.
-------------------------
block
Does not work with Evernote Webclipper ... and therefore useless for me. Sadly ...

btw. why no a "block all from standard" setting ?
-------------------------
protect
Often when a site I use regularly suddenly won't load, this is the culprit. Over the time I've used it, it hasn't protected me in any meaningful way but it has caused me plenty of grief.
-------------------------
block
It used to be great, but after the recent update none of the sliders are adjustable. If it blocks content I want, I can only see it by disabling the entire extension. Not sure why they felt the need to break core functionality. Why bother to have the sliders at all if they don't work?
-------------------------
block
It has been great up until the recent update. Firstly, it is being flagged by Google as slowing down Chrome; and secondly, it is blocking the Buffer extension despite whitelisting and doesn't remember me selecting to unblock.

Edit: uninstalling and reinstalling fixed the Buffer bug.
-------------------------
block
Does nothing for my computer. I have not seen this application be able to block anything. I tried it for a week and find it hard to believe that all the sites I visit are are tracker free and safe. I uninstalled this add-on today.
-------------------------
prevent
This extension seems to prevent Facebook's nosiness with my Google searches.  Only suggestion is to improve stability since Chrome is more crash prone since adding this.
-------------------------
block
Blocks literally nothing unless you manually go through each ad network per page... meaning that latimes article you clicked? Yeah prepare to go through each of the 57 ad networks individually everytime you visit a page. You'll spend more time individually filtering the ad networks then reading the article you clicked on, and at some point you might wonder what exactly the extension does?
-------------------------
block
Perhaps I'm biased toward EFF, but the UI on Privacy Badger seems to do the best job of explaining the allow / block relationship with third parties of any of the tracker blocking extensions.

A number of reviewers are confused about the way that trackers start as "green" when the extension is first installed; it takes a bit of browsing before the Badger's heuristics will recognise and classify every tracker.

There are definitely some things that need to be improved before this is out of "beta": detection of trackers that use supercookies but not regular cookies, optimization of performance and memory usage, better post-install explanation of the code.
-------------------------
block
Does not block trackers by default nor does it give you the option to change this setting (in fact, it lacks any type of settings)
-------------------------
block
Love the concept, but it does seem to slow down performance and loading time. Default settings are a little aggressive, and it would be nice for the extension icon to not just show how many third-party scripts it's detecting, but maybe indicate how many you have not given attention to in addition to the total, or total blocked. (That is to say, the red badge makes me feel like I need to take action, even if I have adjusted settings for a given site.) Looking forward to seeing continued development to improve performance and usability.
-------------------------
block
Blocked some images on one of our work sites from loading even though I had disabled it for that site.
-------------------------

Google Analytics does still track me - even if I block all trackers. This is useless.
-------------------------
block
Blocks all images and generally messes up the layout on a substantial number of news and commerce sites. I run a number of other spyware blocking tools and it's not clear why PB thinks there are problems when the other tools don't.
The plugin provides no explanation features or whitelisting tools so I can't tell if things are being blocked because the plugin is broken or more diligent. If the plugin provided some explanation of why things were blocked, I'd consider giving it more than one star.

It has the right idea, but it blocks too much, and doesn't let you customize it.  I also found that if you want to log into a Google service, it won't let you stay logged in, I don't know if this is by design, but it should let you toggle certain aspects on and off if needed.  Keep up the good work!
-------------------------
block
It blocks the two following Chrome settings and doesn't allow you to reactivate them (in Privacy):
- Use a web service to help resolve navigation errors
- Use a prediction service to help complete searches and URLs typed in the address bar 

I love the second one and I don't understand why it is blocked by default in Chrome Omnibar but still works fine on Google homepage.
I want to be able to control this setting.
-------------------------
block
Blocks Facebook rec/share button on advocacy sites, even if disabled on that site, and/or all Badger FB options opened for the page/site. Only allows display of the button if extension completely disabled. Hopefully this bug can be squashed, otherwise a useful extension.
-------------------------
protect
Works just fine. And I'm more willing to trust the EFF with protecting my privacy than others, such as Ghostery. Minor matter - Alpha version seems to interfere with Kaspersky Security - I've suddenly been getting pop-ups from Kaspersky saying that it does not recognise a site's certificate.
-------------------------

I very much want to use this, as the idea behind it it very good.
However, it causes issues with youtube and google, even if set to "disable for this site". I have to disable Privacy Badger entirely, if I want to rate a comment on a youtube video, for example.

While I could uninstall this, I am just going to toggle it off and on when needed.

Hopefully this alpha version of Privacy Badger will be improved upon to more accurately block out google tracking in a way that normal use of google services is not inadvertently disabled.

Reviews don't know what they are talking about, it breaks many website logins such as google login on Indeed.com and many other websites.  Privacy Badger blocks stuff automatically but it is coded in such a way that it breaks many things not just Google stuff but other stuff as well that is needed to make certain functions on a website to run.  It needs to be configured to know to not block font.gstatic and many other google trackers as it claims aswell.  Unfortunately privacy badger has had this problem for over a year now if not 1+ years and has not been fixed so I would advice to use contentblockhelper extension as that does not block things by default but allows you to choose what to block and it finds every single possible thing on the webpage it even finds the type of font a webpage uses that you disable.  What is nice is you can click the black + and then see what is under a certain category and then tap one of the green + of whatever you choose to disable, if you choose to renable what you blocked you then tap the red - to renabled it and then refresh the webpage.  Last but not least it remembers all websites changes you made so you never have to redo what you have disabled and/or enabled.  Privacy badger is such hot garbage and I would not be surprised if Google owns it and is also making fake reviews on here with 5 stars.  Word to the wise:  Don't believe many reviews nowadays as most of them are fake including responses from people stating what you wrote isn't true or critiquing you about why you would think that and so forth, I believe these to either be bots or people who are not Knowledgeable about extensions, but not me I know what works and what doesn't by using it, I don't trust people anymore as most of are defiantly lying or they are a bot.

This would be great if it worked. Unfortunately, it's been breaking a LOT of sites for me in the past few months. I'm talking like work websites or donation pools. That kind of thing. I'm leaving this review before deleting the extension.

You are right, same here.  Indeed log in with Gmail it broke as well.  It has needed to be updated for a year if not much longer but unfortunately the coders don't know how to code this things to work right or they are doing it on purpose from who knows what reason but I believe it could possibly be money, society is way to greedy nowadays and I am beyond annoyed with it.  So many fake reviews and products that exist, the internet is just a pile of dumb compared to what it used to be.

I got this extension quite recently, and while it may be doing what it says it is doing I have also had increasing difficulties with a number of basic utilities suddenly not working - particularly sound related. I can no longer listen to previews of audio books in Chirp, and Soundcloud has stopped playing entirely. Seriously, if these basic functions cannot run with PB in place I will have to delete it and take my chances.

Broke more websites than the DuckDuckGo extension or my ad blocker (uBlock) but provides easy and advanced options to personalize how it works. They also take direct feedback to report that the extension broke a website. In general, I'd totally reccommend.

Installed this app and my mac started using a ton of battery. After checking the activity monitor, it showed google chrome draining all its battery.

After installing Privacy Badger, the draining starts all over again. DONT INSTALL SAVE YOURSELF THE PAIN

If you want the web to not work right, then this is the tool to achieve that goal.

You'll spend hours scratching your head as to why a spinning icon is appearing over something as simple as Amazon Pay boxes on a website implementing Amazon's payment system before you realise that this extension is causing it - sometimes you forget to check this extension and waste a lot of time and refreshing trying to make a website work.

For example: I seen the Amazon "sign in" pop up window after checking out on a website. I signed in OK, but then the "select a card and address" section wouldn't load. This extension was blocking payments.amazon.com and payments.amazon.co.uk. What kind of stupidity is this?

Initially, it seems pretty cool.  I used it for about six months, If you read about this on some other professional reviews, you'll find something to the effect of "It's cool, but breaks the internet experience"  And that's kinda true.  After you install this, depending if you are a power user or facebook only internet user, be prepared to spend 5-10 minutes a day playing the "ReCaptcha" clicking on the picture games for literally every site you go to.  Does that sound too bad" Well that's 30-60 HOURS of YEAR you are wasting with ReCaptcha because your user experience is indeed kinda broken. Some may say paying 30-60 hours of your LIFE away each year is a small price to pay for added privacy, but I think you are getting by just fine using uBlock, HTTPS everywhere and paying for AdGuard. You have to weigh it yourself. Give it a try for sure.  But I think there are better options out there.  You'll have a LOT more time to live life without this horrible extension wasting your time.

I have used this plugin for a few years now. I use it for its primary purpose: to block trackers. It's probably not the best at ad blocking. I recommend it if you wish to protect your privacy as much as you can.

The only issue I've had is that it will break forms on some sites, but it's easy enough to disable for the site you need to use.

I donate to the EFF and I hope you do too!

I think it's a great app in general but found an issue with adding embedded youtube videos to my 'watch later' list. If I click on 'watch later as xxx' it would pop up with an "invalid request" error message each time. I had to go through all my plug ins to figure out what was blocking this - it's a very handy feature, when I come across a YouTube video on a random site and want to watch it later I simply add it to my Watch Later list and view it when it's convenient. 

For now, I have disabled PB. Hopefully they can add a way to not block this specific feature, let the user decide... ->If there is a way that I didn't see I'd appreciate someone letting me know.

It worked well for a while. Lately many sites are just not loading. I turned it off and things are back to normal. 

When I looked in the settings it was filtering over 3,000 web sites. perhaps that has created a performance issue? Maybe sites need to be removed from a list if they haven't been visited in say 30 days? 

Anyway, I'm not sure the cause, but privacy doesn't do much good if I can't get to the website at all.

I have been using this extension for a while, but am probably going to uninstall it and go back to using AdBlock Plus for the moment. I think PB will improve as more people install it and, hopefully, they report the problems that they find with it. As of now, it breaks too many sites for seemingly innocuous things (images are a big problem, as is video), and I don't have the time to go through upwards of 20 settings to adjust per broken site.

I really appreciate the work that has gone into developing this extension, and like I said, I presume it will improve over time if the developers look into reports users send them regarding problems with blocked sites, which, to be sure, they make very easy for a user to send them. For now, though, everything is a nail to this hammer (or, to put it more accurately, "a slew of things that aren't nails...").

For the small subset of people that may be developers out there: it also blocked get requests to a handful of external api's from localhost (took a couple of annoying minutes to realize that my code wasn't wrong).
-------------------------

This is easy to use and works well - too well. It is too aggressive and broke many sites I use, and the big problem is you can't always tell a site isn't working properly. It isn't always obvious that large chunks of pages just aren't there. Particular problems for me were pictures, review comments, things like that, all legitimate and not the sort of thing I would expect anything to block "out of the box". I don't have the patience to spend hours fine tuning it, so after a few weeks I uninstalled.

Good for peace of mind. The only problem is that when a web site seems broken, you have to remember to disable Privacy Badger for that site to see if it fixes the problem, as the way the tool works does break some sites that are designed in an unusual way. I just wish it had a *temporary* shut-off switch ("Reload without Privacy Badger"?) to help me establish if PB is the problem.

It has a side-effect of blocking some ads, which also causes some news sites to demand you disable it.

I also get this error. Version 54.0.2840.8 dev (64-bit)

-------------------------

I really really wanted to like this extension as I feel I could trust the EFF over other competing extension authors. 

But the plain truth is that it breaks too many pages. I have 5 or so pages totally whitelisted over the last few months of usage just so I can use them.
-------------------------
error
Privacy Badger used to be good but this latest update (running in Chrome 51.0.2704.103 m (64-bit), Windows 10) now saves blocking preferences alongside cookies so when you clear cookies Privacy Badger resets itself. Privacy Badger only did one thing and now it doesn’t even do that. Utterly useless and now removed from Chrome.  Also, EFF offer no support for this extension, with the ‘support site’ link taking you to a FAQ so you can’t even report this error. Doubly useless.
-------------------------

Like they said, it's not meant to be an ad-blocker, and I'm starting to get it. This extension must first WITNESS the trackers actually try to track you (despite Do Not Track settings) before actually deciding to block them, which makes sense. (Everything being green and allowed at first is a bit scary though...)

Unfortunately, in the current state of the web, ads can be loud, obnoxious, animated, bandwidth-eating and even infect your computer immediately just from being loaded. As such, I just feel safer with more paranoid extensions that blacklist things by default.

TL;DR: Privacy on its own doesn't ensure safety. It's okay, but not what I'm after.

Also it breaks a couple pages when it blocks things, so it could use work.

I've been using this for a long time but I hadn't realised how much it had slowed my browsing down, and even completely stopped some safe sites from loading, until I disabled it.

This application does the job it is designed to do very well. I am always interested in seeing the absurd number of intrusions that it has blocked in certain websites. My problem with it is that it seriously effects the working of a number of websites. In particular many websites are unable to play or load videos. While I am sure that some videos are problematic I dont believe as many as it is blocking are. The problem is that when you look at the drop down box it is impossible to see which of the elements being blocked are privacy related and which are content related. I am sure that this is somethign to do with the underlying content, but it means that bar spending 10 minutes every time I want to play a video, I simply end up turning off its protection, which defeats the point of having it in the first place. However most of the time this works without having to think about it

Breaks a few sites (especially ones using dynamically loads reviews). The bigger issue, for me, is that it often chews up CPU time.

Used to work really well but recently it has suffered. Regularly the extension will prevent the page from loading. You'll see a "waiting for Privacy Badger" message. I assume it's because it's grabbing external scripts somewhere. There really should be a fall back option so that if it times out the page can still load. I keep having to disable it and am close to removing. I still have hope though!

Periodically stops responding and only disabling and enabling it allows sites to load. Also breaks too many sites to be useful. Really, really, needs fixing then I'll consider it again.

-------------------------
break
After two months of use, truth is its a giant stinking pile of crap.
It breaks way too many sites and often in non visible ways.

Common examples: you click on a link or a button and it won't work, part of a form doesn't appear, some sites won't load, some will be blank, etc. You think there's a bug on a Web site but at some point, you realize it's because of this piece of crap.

You may not be tracked, but you won't have a fully usable Internet either.
-------------------------
break
And surely it couldn't be possible that the companies who want to collect, sell, and use your data might be doing that on purpose, right?

It really comes down to a question of whether or not you actually want privacy, or just the false appearance of privacy so you can sleep better at night while not actually having it. If an extension is REALLY protecting you, things WILL break from time to time. Although things breaking from time to time doesn't mean you actually ARE being protected, but actually being protected DOES mean that sometimes things aren't going to work right, or at all.

Usability has always come at the expense of security (because of some people being willing to exploit you), and maximum security always comes at the expense of usability. These two things are at odds and can only coexist together through compromising one or the other.

A lot of sites just no longer load if privacy badger is enabled.

Love the concept, but it does seem to slow down performance and loading time. Default settings are a little aggressive, and it would be nice for the extension icon to not just show how many third-party scripts it's detecting, but maybe indicate how many you have not given attention to in addition to the total, or total blocked. (That is to say, the red badge makes me feel like I need to take action, even if I have adjusted settings for a given site.) Looking forward to seeing continued development to improve performance and usability.

MASSIVELY slows the loading of the browser even on my top-end gaming PC.

good idea sloppy implementation

-no sync, import/export or similar
- not aggressive enough,  that is, it takes forever before it starts blocking even 'well-known' trackers...

But I have seen that's capable to "see" trackers and third party crap, similar programs didn't.

Bottom line:
For the time being, I would only it as a secondary privacy protection solution next to whatever you've been using already...
-------------------------
third
Perhaps I'm biased toward EFF, but the UI on Privacy Badger seems to do the best job of explaining the allow / block relationship with third parties of any of the tracker blocking extensions.

A number of reviewers are confused about the way that trackers start as "green" when the extension is first installed; it takes a bit of browsing before the Badger's heuristics will recognise and classify every tracker.

There are definitely some things that need to be improved before this is out of "beta": detection of trackers that use supercookies but not regular cookies, optimization of performance and memory usage, better post-install explanation of the code.

It has great functionality and is well designed so it has potential to be a great ad blocker but the amount of work required from the user is tremendous.  A user will have to turn off trackers for days as they visit various websites because Privacy Badger green lights various trackers such as google analytics or connect.facebook. 
What gets my 2/5 stars is that Privacy Badger outright lies and claims google analytics and connect.facebook (and various other known trackers) are not tracking you.  
Life Hacker and various other journalists have already uncovered and explained how the various social media connect features track our movements without us even being logged in.

Why Electronic Frontier Foundation blatantly lies to the users about the tracking and greenlights these trackers is unknown, but I'd suspect some money was involved...

Used to have utter confidence in EFF, it's been shattered by this product.

On the settings page --> tracking domains list, you scroll down the list and move the tracking slider for each domain manually. Annoyingly, when you move the slider for a domain, you are auto-returned to the top of that list, meaning one has to re-scroll back down the list each time the slider is moved. Very frustrating when a large number of domains need adjustments to their tracking setting.

It worked well for a while. Lately many sites are just not loading. I turned it off and things are back to normal. 

When I looked in the settings it was filtering over 3,000 web sites. perhaps that has created a performance issue? Maybe sites need to be removed from a list if they haven't been visited in say 30 days? 

Anyway, I'm not sure the cause, but privacy doesn't do much good if I can't get to the website at all.

This application does the job it is designed to do very well. I am always interested in seeing the absurd number of intrusions that it has blocked in certain websites. My problem with it is that it seriously effects the working of a number of websites. In particular many websites are unable to play or load videos. While I am sure that some videos are problematic I dont believe as many as it is blocking are. The problem is that when you look at the drop down box it is impossible to see which of the elements being blocked are privacy related and which are content related. I am sure that this is somethign to do with the underlying content, but it means that bar spending 10 minutes every time I want to play a video, I simply end up turning off its protection, which defeats the point of having it in the first place. However most of the time this works without having to think about it

This used to be great, but lately it's whitelisting every tracker for some reason, even ones that are obviously ad trackers.  Sometimes it's even re-adding a website to the whitelist even after I manually add it to the blacklist.  This is a serious issue that's rendering it quite useless.

It has the right idea, but it blocks too much, and doesn't let you customize it.

Keep up the good work!

I very much want to use this, as the idea behind it it very good.

While I could uninstall this, I am just going to toggle it off and on when needed.

Hopefully this alpha version of Privacy Badger will be improved upon to more accurately block out google tracking in a way that normal use of google services is not inadvertently disabled.

If I click on 'watch later as xxx' it would pop up with an "invalid request" error message each time. I had to go through all my plug ins to figure out what was blocking this - it's a very handy feature, when I come across a YouTube video on a random site and want to watch it later I simply add it to my Watch Later list and view it when it's convenient. 

For now, I have disabled PB. Hopefully they can add a way to not block this specific feature, let the user decide... ->If there is a way that I didn't see I'd appreciate someone letting me know.

This extension is awesome. I always hated seeing ads for products or pages I just visited, its pretty obvious your activity is being tracked which really annoyed me. Anyways this totally solves that but it will also make you realize just how much you're tracked and by what websites/services. (PS. its scary)

Sometimes it can make certain website functions not appear or work properly but its easy to either allow that function or just white list the site.

anyone who uses the internet should have this.

list
Privacy Badger does not come with a list of domains to block. Instead, Privacy Badger watches which third-party domains appear to track you as you browse the Web. If Privacy Badger sees the same domain track you across three different sites, Privacy Badger will start blocking resources from that domain.

We are working on making the way Privacy Badger works more clear in the future.

if you use other privacy tools or ad blockers in combination with Privacy Badger, your Badger will learn to block far fewer domains. This is fine: Privacy Badger will be there to catch whatever your other blockers let through.

I really really wanted to like this extension as I feel I could trust the EFF over other competing extension authors. 

But the plain truth is that it breaks too many pages. I have 5 or so pages totally whitelisted over the last few months of usage just so I can use them.
-------------------------
blacklist
Like they said, it's not meant to be an ad-blocker, and I'm starting to get it. This extension must first WITNESS the trackers actually try to track you (despite Do Not Track settings) before actually deciding to block them, which makes sense. (Everything being green and allowed at first is a bit scary though...)

Unfortunately, in the current state of the web, ads can be loud, obnoxious, animated, bandwidth-eating and even infect your computer immediately just from being loaded. As such, I just feel safer with more paranoid extensions that blacklist things by default.

TL;DR: Privacy on its own doesn't ensure safety. It's okay, but not what I'm after.

Also it breaks a couple pages when it blocks things, so it could use work.
-------------------------
list
This is a good app, but recently it's been slowing down my browsing substantially and I have to disable it entirely to have pages load in a reasonable period of time. 

I'm not sure that's because it's gotten bloated, or if it just can't handle the amount of rules it's developed for cookies and such as that list gets longer...

Keeps getting worse for me.

Blocks all images and generally messes up the layout on a substantial number of news and commerce sites. I run a number of other spyware blocking tools and it's not clear why PB thinks there are problems when the other tools don't.

Reviews don't know what they are talking about, it breaks many website logins such as google login on Indeed.com and many other websites.  Privacy Badger blocks stuff automatically but it is coded in such a way that it breaks many things not just Google stuff but other stuff as well that is needed to make certain functions on a website to run.  It needs to be configured to know to not block font.gstatic and many other google trackers as it claims aswell.  Unfortunately privacy badger has had this problem for over a year now if not 1+ years and has not been fixed so I would advice to use contentblockhelper extension as that does not block things by default but allows you to choose what to block and it finds every single possible thing on the webpage it even finds the type of font a webpage uses that you disable.  What is nice is you can click the black + and then see what is under a certain category and then tap one of the green + of whatever you choose to disable, if you choose to renable what you blocked you then tap the red - to renabled it and then refresh the webpage.  Last but not least it remembers all websites changes you made so you never have to redo what you have disabled and/or enabled.  Privacy badger is such hot garbage and I would not be surprised if Google owns it and is also making fake reviews on here with 5 stars.  Word to the wise:  Don't believe many reviews nowadays as most of them are fake including responses from people stating what you wrote isn't true or critiquing you about why you would think that and so forth, I believe these to either be bots or people who are not Knowledgeable about extensions, but not me I know what works and what doesn't by using it, I don't trust people anymore as most of are defiantly lying or they are a bot.

It basically works well but if your militant about blocking the deluge of junk being forced into your browsing experience then you may think Badger lets to much through by default. In a sense it does, as it requires you to be actively (pro-actively) adjusting the settings to suite your preferences which gets a bit tedious.

Yeah this was my experience too. Many many websites use legitimate external scripts, and blocking all of them by default was not workable. Maybe once more people have used it and they've been able to tune the defaults better I'll come back. (But it already says 600k users :S)

Love the concept, but it does seem to slow down performance and loading time. Default settings are a little aggressive, and it would be nice for the extension icon to not just show how many third-party scripts it's detecting, but maybe indicate how many you have not given attention to in addition to the total, or total blocked. (That is to say, the red badge makes me feel like I need to take action, even if I have adjusted settings for a given site.) Looking forward to seeing continued development to improve performance and usability.

It blocks the two following Chrome settings and doesn't allow you to reactivate them (in Privacy):

My internet experience in general seems to have improved since installing Privacy Badger. It is not high maintenance at all as some have claimed.  It just sits there quietly, doing its thing for the most part.

I've been receiving a lot of spam lately from overseas.  I know it is because they are somehow reading my browser history because they always contain my recent key search words.  I don't have a lot of extensions and the ones I have are pretty benign I think.  The two I have some question about are New Tab Redirect and Stylist but I really like those two.  I am hoping that Privacy Badger will block anyone from reading my history and reduce the amount of spam I receive as a result of this exploit.

And surely it couldn't be possible that the companies who want to collect, sell, and use your data might be doing that on purpose, right?

It really comes down to a question of whether or not you actually want privacy, or just the false appearance of privacy so you can sleep better at night while not actually having it. If an extension is REALLY protecting you, things WILL break from time to time. Although things breaking from time to time doesn't mean you actually ARE being protected, but actually being protected DOES mean that sometimes things aren't going to work right, or at all.

Usability has always come at the expense of security (because of some people being willing to exploit you), and maximum security always comes at the expense of usability. These two things are at odds and can only coexist together through compromising one or the other.

Love the concept, but it does seem to slow down performance and loading time. Default settings are a little aggressive, and it would be nice for the extension icon to not just show how many third-party scripts it's detecting, but maybe indicate how many you have not given attention to in addition to the total, or total blocked. (That is to say, the red badge makes me feel like I need to take action, even if I have adjusted settings for a given site.) Looking forward to seeing continued development to improve performance and usability.
-------------------------
slow
Loading really really slow. Sites are taking forever to open while waiting for this extension to load. This seems to be a recent development on the most recent Chrome Version 40.0.2214.28 beta-m (64-bit) on Windows 8.1.
-------------------------
slow
MASSIVELY slows the loading of the browser even on my top-end gaming PC. Makes the browser lock up (Windows states that it is unresponsive and asks if I want to close Chrome) for 30 to 40 seconds each and every time that the browser is loaded. The situation is predictably worse on this under powered notebook from which I am presently writing this review.  This add-on is a great idea, but has terrible execution.
-------------------------
fast
Causes Chrome.exe to lingering around for some time after closing the browser. Disk and memory activity observed in Win 8 Task Manager. Try closing Chrome and immediately trying to open it again.

With Privacy Badger disabled Chrome.exe unloads fast on browser close.

Version 1.1.0 no longer works effectively. (supposedly removed the functionality of Javascript Objects spoofing)

Last working version was: 1.0.43, which can be downloaded here:
https://www.crx4chrome.com/crx/169490/



FYI, UA Detection Test:

HTTP Header Based:
https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent

Javascript Based:
https://webbrowsertools.com/useragent/?verbose=true

While I haven't found an extension that can pass the Javascript Based one yet... (currently this extension works best for me)



Friendly Reminder:

The "Domain" field in "Permanent Spoof List" expects a RegEx so... mind your grammar.





Suggestion and Feedback:

The "Import/Export Settings" is apparently broken, so apparent that I don't even need to say where & how... (one thing: "Permanent Spoof List", the rest... try you'll see)

Cannot seem to find a way to adjust the order of the entries in "Permanent Spoof List" (...deleting everything then rewrite doesn't count), while the order does matter... (top of the list has higher priority)

Not working on "file://" URLs?.. (even if explicitly allowed of doing so)

On the Javascript Objects spoofing, the navigator object in <iframe>s doesn't seem to be manipulated. (forgotten?..)

you'll have problems with many websites when this extension is enabled, e.g. try logging in to your Nike account, you'll get a server error. Also many other sites will give you errors.
So, NO, not very useful.

bug
Does not work on opentable.com.  I can see in HTTP headers sent that it is still sending the browser's own user agent, not the one I selected.  This is despite the extension icon correctly showing the user agent it is supposedly configured to use.  Does work on other sites though.  So there is a weird bug somewhere.
-------------------------
access
Does not work with some sites. Support site appears to be down or abandoned, so can't directly report failures. Would really prefer to support the "by Google" solution in my environment, but other extensions appear to work better and have a nicer interface for users. Would be nice to have this as a standard feature for users in Chrome to access sites via a mobile version where possible without having to get into developer tools; as in the Chrome on Android app with the desktop site option.
-------------------------
error
Doesn't appear to work, and gives too little feedback to troubleshoot. I'm trying to use a web site that won't work with Chromium browser, so I select Chrome>Default in this extension, and my site still gives me the unsupported browser error. But the extension gives no indication if my settings are still active, what user agent is active on the current site, etc. Nowhere that I can see to make settings permanent on a page or domain, or any other useful features. All you get is a selection menu that doesn't do what it's supposed to, as far as I can tell.

Edit: Priyanka, thank you for your response. Yes, I have to use it constantly on a few work pages. If I access them, I have to spoof them to get everything to work correctly. I'm hoping that goes away in the future since we have a couple very important customers who are now required by corporate edict to only use Google Chrome.

This is a fantastic tool, however lately it's causing Chrome to lag. Sometimes so much I have to kill chrome completely. If I could just kill the extension itself, I would, but that would defeat the purpose of having an extension--enhancing the use of this browser. I didn't know this until a couple days ago, an error came up that specifically said, "Waiting for User-Agent Switcher".

Idea is what many are after.  Implementation needs works, it loads on every http request it seems.  My status area in chrome is always filled with "Waiting for extension User-agent Switcher for Chrome..." and many pages won't load properly with it enabled.  To use it I constantly have to disable/re-enable to avoid these load issues.

Does exactly as advertised. Those of you having issues with sites not being over-ridden remember that cookies store data and that may interfere.

I was using this tool to spoof my UA for netflix, since has the ability to define spoofs for certain domains, which would allow me to use pipelight on Netflix, and it did work. The problem lies in the fact that it loads on every page, even if you have it set to the default browser, often causing sites, such as facebook to freeze up. The only way to get around this is to disable it, I want a plugin that does it on a per tab/site basis, and doesn't try to load unless something has been specified, or alternatively, doesn't lag the entire connection when you try to load.

Great extension for web development. Easily allows you to define and add you own custom user agents to the pre-defined list. 

I wish it would work per-window, however. Unfortunately, switching your user agent in a single tab or window globally changes your user agents, which generally breaks all of my other open browser windows.
-------------------------
load
I like the functionality EXCEPT for one MAJOR ISSUE.

Gmail will not load unless user agent is set to default chrome or a mobile browser user agent string (like the provided Nexus 7 one). Even the out of box options like FF, Opera, Safari won't load for me. The desktop version of Gmail shows the loading bar stuck at like 95%. Using the same user agent strings through registry keys or UAPicker for IE9 works, as does using developer tools provided by other browsers.

Maybe something else is wrong on my end, but please test and fix if necessary.

But there's one glitch: I am using Chrome 22 and this extension disable the drag feature of Google Maps & I installed chrome  just because of its great speed with maps :( So waiting for this bug to be taken off the extension.
-------------------------
stop
I can finally ditch IEtab extension! Finally those MS fanboi servers that reject non-IE users can stop slowing down my PC.  I now use Chrome for websites that have no idea that Chrome works just fine with them (even a few work ones!).

Quick question:
* Does this support Google sync for extension data? That is, are "Permanent Spoof" settings sync'd to other instances of the extension under the same Google profile?

Suggestions:
* Not immediately obvious how to revert back to 'normal' mode (chrome/default)

* Redundant submenus - they're like "Success!" dialogs.  If there's only one user agent option for a browser type (e.g. Chrome/Default), then trigger the selection when I click "Chrome". Don't make me click "default", as if I have some kind of other selection choices.

Reminders:
1. This extension only changes a single string that a browser responds with when a server asks for it.  It doesn't make Chrome actually emulate any of the long list of alternative (or very broken) browser versions that you can choose from.

2. Always clear your cookies for a given website if you start seeing weird behaviour, since some sites get confused when you use different browsers from the same PC.

bug
for the most part works great however some major bugs. sometimes, it stops pages from loading. I know this because in the status bar it says waiting for user-agent-switcher. Also. it can sometimes prevent gmail from loading. I have no idea why it happens, but disabling user-agent switcher helps me access gmail again.  The default string i use is windows, firefox 10

This extension worked for months, however recently it no longer works for javascript detection.

I love developers making the handy and cool things like this extension, now I have Facebook and others knocking off "warnings that Chrome you're using is outdated, upgrade here" messages.
Haha, they don't know the difference, not counting they think I'm using Mac when it's really Linux!
Fun stuff to see, it's great.
I have an old Chrome 48.0.2 and can't upgrade since they no longer offer 32 bit for Linux but this overrides the issue.
I haven't tried the autoselect feature so I cannot rate that, I'm using the manually put in one and it's great.

Great extension for web development. Easily allows you to define and add you own custom user agents to the pre-defined list. 

I wish it would work per-window, however. Unfortunately, switching your user agent in a single tab or window globally changes your user agents, which generally breaks all of my other open browser windows.

Nice job!

I would like to give a little UX suggestion.

It would be really convenient if the UA selection balloon goes away upon the selection of a UA from the list.  With the current implementation, we have to click somewhere else to close it, which is a little unusual and not really expected.

I have 3, so far, websites that don't work on Chromebooks because they require Chrome browser on Windows, which can be resolved with a custom user agent string, "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko" not natively available in the program but can be added. The problem is the only way to modify settings is per user. If I came across a new website, I would have to log into 200+ accounts and make modifications each and every time. Not really a viable solution.

In G Suite Admin control panel, under "Device management > Chrome > Apps & extensions > Users & browsers" the app has the option for "Policy for extensions" that accepts JSON. This program exports a JSON file, but it doesn't work when applied to the "Policy for extensions".

If the exported JSON could be plugged into the "Policy for extensions" section, I could modify the program for all users across the organization in a matter of minutes. Please add this functionality and, I would suggest, the User-Agent I mentioned above, as it seems to solve a lot of issues that none of the default user agents fix.

I was using this tool to spoof my UA for netflix, since has the ability to define spoofs for certain domains, which would allow me to use pipelight on Netflix, and it did work. The problem lies in the fact that it loads on every page, even if you have it set to the default browser, often causing sites, such as facebook to freeze up. The only way to get around this is to disable it, I want a plugin that does it on a per tab/site basis, and doesn't try to load unless something has been specified, or alternatively, doesn't lag the entire connection when you try to load.

I was unable to load Gmail Standard in Chrome and spent a long time trying to figure out why until I disabled this and it loaded. Then I saw Zack Loveless' comment from Aug 2, 2013 and the penny dropped - I had changed the user agent yesterday. So, now, all extensions enabled and user agent back to default. *doh*
-------------------------
default
I like the functionality EXCEPT for one MAJOR ISSUE.

Gmail will not load unless user agent is set to default chrome or a mobile browser user agent string (like the provided Nexus 7 one). Even the out of box options like FF, Opera, Safari won't load for me. The desktop version of Gmail shows the loading bar stuck at like 95%. Using the same user agent strings through registry keys or UAPicker for IE9 works, as does using developer tools provided by other browsers.

Maybe something else is wrong on my end, but please test and fix if necessary.

This extension worked great, until today. Because it started messing up YouTube. When I visit YouTube it wouldn't load certain scripts and images. The user-agent was set to Chrome > Default. After disabling the plugin the YouTube issues were gone.

For obscure Chrome-derived browsers like YB, UA Spoofer needs to add an option Chrome>Generic.

Edit: Priyanka, thank you for your response. Yes, I have to use it constantly on a few work pages. If I access them, I have to spoof them to get everything to work correctly. I'm hoping that goes away in the future since we have a couple very important customers who are now required by corporate edict to only use Google Chrome.

This is a fantastic tool, however lately it's causing Chrome to lag. Sometimes so much I have to kill chrome completely. If I could just kill the extension itself, I would, but that would defeat the purpose of having an extension--enhancing the use of this browser. I didn't know this until a couple days ago, an error came up that specifically said, "Waiting for User-Agent Switcher".

Worthless, I downloaded this because I wanted to be able to change the OS of the user agent, and it doesn't have this feature. I frequently get locked out of sites because they don't support Linux even if I'm using up-to-date browsers that are supported on Mac and Windows. I hoped this would fix it, but no...this very essential / basic feature was completely missing.  I'll gladly reinstall (and re-rate) if this feature is added, but as-is this extension is SUPER minimal and doesn't do what I want.

Very limited on options of browsers and devices. 

Go with something else unless they update the list.

Only one flavor of Android, etc.

I'm using the extension to make OWA show the "enhanced" view.

The user-agent isn't getting spoofed when I reload the browser if the tab is pinned.

BTW, it also uses --auth-server-whitelist for kerberos.

To fix, I have to clear the sites cookies, then reload the page. :(

I've tried spoofing more than one kind of browser to be able to use the IKEA kitchen planner. It didn't work -and, strangely enough, IKEA says Google Chrome is one it does work with, and it doesn't work from my Chromebook unspoofed, either. 

Also tried it with the free tools at Typing Chimp, which work best with Frefox. So, I wrote to them and I told them about the things I tried and they told me this app does not actually work toward fooling theirs into thinking someone is using Firefox or any other browser their app works with. 

So, no joy, whatsoever!

I hate to join those who have rated this thing so poorly. However, it deserves the poor rating. 

It changed my agent status, but once I was at the site, I couldn't left click, rendering all my effort pointless. What's worse, even disabling or uninstalling it doesn't return functionality back to the browser. 

Please beware. You have been warned.

I was using this tool to spoof my UA for netflix, since has the ability to define spoofs for certain domains, which would allow me to use pipelight on Netflix, and it did work. The problem lies in the fact that it loads on every page, even if you have it set to the default browser, often causing sites, such as facebook to freeze up. The only way to get around this is to disable it, I want a plugin that does it on a per tab/site basis, and doesn't try to load unless something has been specified, or alternatively, doesn't lag the entire connection when you try to load.
-------------------------
browser
Great extension for web development. Easily allows you to define and add you own custom user agents to the pre-defined list. 

I wish it would work per-window, however. Unfortunately, switching your user agent in a single tab or window globally changes your user agents, which generally breaks all of my other open browser windows.

A word of warning - I tested this on a corporate website built with Joomla and after trying 4 or 5 browser options the server blacklisted my IP address. An admin on the site had to go in and dig the IP out of the blocked list.

I like the functionality EXCEPT for one MAJOR ISSUE.

Gmail will not load unless user agent is set to default chrome or a mobile browser user agent string (like the provided Nexus 7 one). Even the out of box options like FF, Opera, Safari won't load for me. The desktop version of Gmail shows the loading bar stuck at like 95%. Using the same user agent strings through registry keys or UAPicker for IE9 works, as does using developer tools provided by other browsers.

Maybe something else is wrong on my end, but please test and fix if necessary.

browser
The developers of this app need to leave browser properties alone. This extension overrides navigator.appName, and causes a ReferenceError saying "stopUsingAppNameForBrowserSniffingItsBad."

This breaks any site that relies on that property, including any site built on jQuery Mobile. Had to disable this extension to continue development on our mobile site.

It's good, but has a tendency to lock up the browser.  Chrome gets stuck "waiting for extension" which make me have to restart the browser on Windows 7 latest Chrome (prod).

I can finally ditch IEtab extension! Finally those MS fanboi servers that reject non-IE users can stop slowing down my PC.  I now use Chrome for websites that have no idea that Chrome works just fine with them (even a few work ones!).

Quick question:
* Does this support Google sync for extension data? That is, are "Permanent Spoof" settings sync'd to other instances of the extension under the same Google profile?

Suggestions:
* Not immediately obvious how to revert back to 'normal' mode (chrome/default)

* Redundant submenus - they're like "Success!" dialogs.  If there's only one user agent option for a browser type (e.g. Chrome/Default), then trigger the selection when I click "Chrome". Don't make me click "default", as if I have some kind of other selection choices.

Reminders:
1. This extension only changes a single string that a browser responds with when a server asks for it.  It doesn't make Chrome actually emulate any of the long list of alternative (or very broken) browser versions that you can choose from.

2. Always clear your cookies for a given website if you start seeing weird behaviour, since some sites get confused when you use different browsers from the same PC.
-------------------------
browser
While it enables Chrome to act as different browsers, after short while I discovered that the "default" setting does not return Chrome to its original state; now I seldom can do search from the address bar as it kept informing me that instant search is not available, while previously I have no problem with that.
-------------------------
browser
Once I realized that the minimum Chrome version needed to be on the Dev release track, it all worked.  Kind of a pain until then.

This would get 5 stars the temporary setting could be per tab rather than browser wide.

It's a pity that it requires the access to "your data on all websites," and "your tabs and browsing activity."

"Access your page data on all websites"
"Access your tabs and browsing history"

Does exactly as advertised. Those of you having issues with sites not being over-ridden remember that cookies store data and that may interfere.

The only problem I have had is I am working on a chromebook and I get errors about things like ActiveX on Internet Explorer. No big deal though, and that isn't even something this extension was built to do so I won't complain!

Great tool, robust, but appears to have been abandoned.  There are a lot of features that aren't controllable on a granular level.  Sometimes a site will be broken and no matter how many things you allow, it'll still be broken until you disable Scriptsafe altogether.  There's no option to disable on a per-domain basis either, it's all or nothing in that regard.

Still, there are a TON of privacy related features as well as ad and script blocking.  Great tool, but has flaws and unfortunately it isn't being updated any longer.

Extension does not block content on first load in Chrome/Chromium. After the extension is passed the web content (it pops in on the page then gets blocked afterwards) it will pass it though the ruleset. 

Could be a glitch, but I noticed it the most on weather.com. The extension also needs script specific blocking with heuristics and signatures so I can select which scripts from what domain are loaded.

My previous belief was that this was adequate to block zero-day exploits against webkit and renderer exploits or some other bloatware feature of the browser, but it is not.

It works nice! 
I am using this is very much like NoScript  on firefox. 
However, in the course of webdev over the years there is an increasing amount of use cases where important page elements simply disappear on a website when some site is not enabled. 

I believe this style of webpages are increasing, so what we really need is a shared database with a finer classifications of sites. 
I can imagine a kind of site-voting engine for script block users, so its easy to share the classification of a site and see classification from others.

In the end its about a quick decision to include frontend code from certrain sites, sometimes its needed, sometimes not, sometimes its essential! 

I encountered some bad examples where a checkout flow was missing very important parts.
So if sites which are known to create important content can be tagged, this information can be fed back to the script blocking extentions to support the user in the decision of enabling additional sources.

I see a few different approaches to move forward:
-an integrated evaluation scheme to simplify classification of javascript servers
- maybe even a computation intensive black box approach where the code is executed in a box and the difference to the DOM is evaluated to judge the impact

I think the users of this plugin are a really good user group to discuss  this! :)

I've been using it for a long time now to block ads and other unwanted content. It's not perfect, but it's great. There are moments where it seems to have like a hundred things to block or unblock, but it's tolerable.

Right now, however, I am experiencing a popup on my homepage "chrome://apps/" where it detects that I have things synched to Google and asks for permission to do so every time I launch Chrome even though I have it set not to provide that popup.
-------------------------
protect
I wish the developer would just stick to fingerprint and script protection and clean out the crud from his codebase. But this all seems unlikely since the developer looks to have given up.
-------------------------
block
Does not allow blocking of individual scripts within a domain or sub-domain.

The number in parenthesis in front of a domain/sub-domain shows the number of scripts within that domain/sub-domain, and mouse over shows those url's, but those javascripts can not be selected to allow or block.

If I wanted to block a script, I would have to block the entire domain/sub-domain.

Also, if you block a subdomain, on one site, it blocks it globally, add **.adservice.google.com to the blacklist and it's blocked on every site in existence, including google.com.

What should happen is if I block a subdomain that's running scripts on a domain, it should be blocked ONLY on that domain,,

EG, if adservice.google.com is being blocked on say testsite.com, then that subdomain shold ONLY be blocked on testingsite.com ONLY, and not blocked globally across any domain.

Was great... Until the latest update.  Now it blocks everything, and enabling everything one at a time is irritating, so I just disable it.  Essentially it has become malware.

I tested it on amiunique.org; the issues I had were, I had to allow scripts on that site to run in order to perform the test. As the only extension running, the following did not work for some reason: It did not randomize my time zone, nor my user agent, and it showed my list of plug-ins, and my hash tracking. I allowed it on panopticlick and it protected against some things, but not against fingerprinting, even though I had all fingerprinting options enabled. I am not sure why it didn't work as expected. Not behind a proxy and only used this extension.

@Reth Tard 

Do you understand the point of having a script blocker?  You can get effective script blocking from other extensions that don't lose their settings without blowing a gaping hole in your protection.  Your repetitive comments insulting people on this page are childish.  I hope you figure out what it is that makes you want to attack anonymous people on the internet and are able to solve your problems.
-------------------------
block
Did you take look the options? All scripts are deactivated by default, for top security but if you're lazy and you don't care about security, all you have to do is, open the Options page, then:

General Settings / Default Mode / "Allow" instead of "Block"

It just started blocking anything google related lately. The tabs that try to open google services will simply not load at all. Disabling ScriptSafe makes them load again just fine, and Google is added to whitelist as well.

It is great extension preventing unsafe scripts. But, it is not easy to use when you wanna allow all scripts temporarily except those which are known to be unwanted!

I use JSBlocker with Safari. Its a dream compared to this mess. Unfortunately not available for Chrome.

With ScriptSafe: Pages don't load. Page functionality is compromised. The developers simply block just about everything as a default, even though some of what's blocked is basic site functionality.

For about a month now I'm having one site after another not be able to load at all. A blank page is what I get. Open  same page in Safari, no problems.

Now deleted. A totally overrated extension.

It is blocking scripts without showing them in the interface. The result is that for some websites you have to disable the extension altogether. This means that its disabled for all subsequent sites unless you remember to re-enable it.

I keep coming back to this extension and then get frustrated as heck playing wack a mole with scripts on websites. 

The frustration builds up enough that I wind up ditching this extension for another script blocker as both my time is worth more than the frustration having to determine what to enable scriptwise on websites.
-------------------------
block
I really like ScriptSafe it's just about perfect for my needs. But there is one thing that I do not like and hope there is a workaround for it. The issue is when you are blocking things on a image site like imagebam foe example you can not click the image to zoom in. If I disable ScriptSafe I can zoom in on the image. But of course then I may also get nasty popups. Is there anyway to block the site but enable zooming in on images?

However, you could enable javascript and then block the 3rd party external sites (or subdomains maybe) that the pop ups are coming from.

People like you are the bane of my existence. Just learn how to use a script blocker, if you are going to use one. Figure it out, it's not hard. It's very simple to learn how to do it, and would have taken you about the same amount of time as you spent reviewing this badly.   Bob A, that is not true. Some extensions are here for people who have actual tech knowledge & need utilities that allow them to do things like block scripts. Just because you don't understand it, does not by any means make it useless or mean that it should be "intuitive" or "lightweight" (btw, how the hell is this not lightweight?)
-------------------------
block
This extension blocks ajax.googleapis.com which is necessary for websites that use Google's jQuery (and other libraries) CDN- that's a lot of websites. This resource is not shown in the "external resources" pane of ScriptSafe, but it is ScriptSafe that blocks the resource (confirmed with Chrome's network inspector). ScriptSafe seemingly does not provide a way to allow this resource, despite it being necessary across the Internet. I've had to disable ScriptSafe entirely to get many webpages to work properly.
-------------------------
block
Funny, when I block ajax.googleapis.com with NoScript in FF, I don't have those issues. Usually it doesn't do anything to hamper my usage of the internet. Nothing gets broken...
-------------------------
block
Inferior to noscript for firefox, you don't have full control of what script are being blocked, you need to disable the whole extension in order to browse some of the site you do trust.
-------------------------
block
I agree with some of the recent reviews, in that ScriptSafe works a little to well in blocking scripts and potentially malicious code on websites. There's something broken though, so that I can't enable parts (Allow/Trust) of sites I _do_ want to use. Also, it shows in red how many items were blocked, but for some reason there's no way to view those items. Something must have bugged since Chrome or this extension updated. Removing, but would come back to it if it gets fixed.
-------------------------

While the app did it's job, it did it to well. I wanted something that would stop the scripts from loading in an "overlay" above a flash player that I use on a website to watch TV shows on. They are borderline clickjacking, and had one that loaded over a 1000 tabs, crashed my computer even with adblocker and avg running, each time a tab finished loading it opened a new one, each time I closed one two more opened in their place with crap I had to click click click out of to close that one. I ended up having to use taskmanger to get out, even CTRL+F4 didn't work. Well, ScriptSafe blocked the video embeded frame, and doesn't let me whitelist the video and frame and block the ads that are overlays of the flash player. Even though they are not hosted by the player's hosting site and have separate hosting URLs. I ended up using uMatrix. While it did block the embeded frame the video played in, I was able to white list that and that only. The popups didn't completely go away, but they no longer load ad/spam content that can crash my computer again. Instead the popup window opens, and a notice that it was blocked by uMatrix is in it's place and no further action was required. I liked ScriptSafe for what it did, but it's just to inflexible for what I wanted and didn't have enough user functionality to get me to the point I wanted to be at with my browsing. Since I live in an area that doesn't have broadcast TV, and I can't afford the expensive cost of cable or satellite, I depend on that site to watch my broadcast TV.
-------------------------

Thanks you so much, work perfect but need more improve. My suggestion, add new function that can view what script it block in text file only.

After installing this and finding it broke a LOT of websites for me, forcing me to manually go through and pick the 2 or 3 things i NEEDED to allow that it was blocking, important stuff like login popups and such, i removed it. Well, now chrome wont remember ANY of my logins even after removing this. I even went so far as to go through settings and manually make sure everything was being allowed, but apparently this extension changed something fundamental to the point every website now requires a login on EVERY visit.

I'm a long time user of this extension, but the author has succumbed to the industry practice of 'improving' the product to the point where all of its original elegant simplicity and ease-of-use has disappeared under a cumbersome list of options and an ever changing UI.
I call it Google syndrome although it's a common affliction of many software developers.
I am not interested in spending an hour or more re-learning a program/extension, its interface, new operating requirements, etc.
Before I had a quick option to block allow everything on a site... now that button is gone and I seem unable to individually get blocked elements to work temporarily.
If you are going to change things simply for the sake of change, at least give us an easy option to revert back to a previous version and turn off auto-update. Auto-update turned off should the default.
-------------------------
block
Update: Aside from the complaint below, the author is now pushing out a new update almost every single day. Instead of improving performance, these updates have had the opposite effect. High CPU usage and a slew of new and useless options is now making the extension a liability. I'm not a beta tester, I'm an end user. 

Original review:

Needlessly complex and unreliable. Currently there are 5 different options to that can be selected; Allow, Trust, Deny, Distrust and Temp. Only two are needed; Allow and Allow Permanently.

Often SafeScript simply doesn't work. Despite allowing or trusting a script, this extension continues to block it from running. The only solution is to disable SafeScript completely.
-------------------------
block
Don't have a Git account so I'll post this here. I really like this extension and have used it for years, but with one of the recent updates I no longer seem to be able to block doubleclick.net, either manually or while visiting pages that display its ads.

In addition, I feel the removal of showing what resources are currently blocked and allowed when a page is fully "clean" and you click ScriptSafe's icon is a terrible step backwards. (I recognize this could also be a bug, as some pages still show it while others have a completely blank ScriptSafe dropdown.)

I've decided to just completely clear my whitelist and blacklist. It seems there were just too many entries from the pre-full domain support period before the new updates. Performing better now as well, though it looks like distrusted resources still don't always appear in ScriptSafe on certain pages.
-------------------------
block
Thanks for this, that does sound like a bug as the panel should show everything that is blocked/allowed. Do you remember which page this occurred on? I'll modify the behaviour in the next update so any domains explicitly blocked will not be accessible. Will test for a day or two before releasing.
-------------------------
block
Thanks, the  cpu usage seems to be related to the Block Click-Through Referrer option (https://github.com/andryou/scriptsafe/issues/38) and will be addressed in the next release. I've already committed the change on Github, but am spending the weekend testing it and other changes out before I release the next version. I am making an active attempt at slowing down the pace, doing more testing, and I feel after this next release ScriptSafe will be more stable along with all the new features built-in over the past week.

A few nitpicks:
Can you change the "Website" on the Chrome webstore link to the github page? I want to contribute, if possible.
Also, I use uBlock Origin, which also protects the IP address from WebRTC. Would these extensions conflict?
-------------------------
block
Lets not do that unless its a feature disabled by default.  What most seriously security concious people want out of this is more than just blocking potential malicious code. Its also about anonymity on the web. Java and other forms of code can still track you even on precious sites like Youtube, Facebook, Google, and especially sites like Youtube Facebook and Google. Its not a bad feature but it would be pointless for me to spend the last 14 hours wiping out any possible hint of what can be tracked and identified as me even using my desktop only to start chrome and be traced throughout every "uprated" site I go on. You also have the problem of casual users sending erroneous data back and having sites falsely whitelisted. Joe schmoe and his 14 pals all did it to a website they made with a 0day exploit and then paid google to get it around town. Now you've opened up the page and get an applet drive by and your system is compromised by a backdoor shell. Joe has root access (or admin access for windows users) and can see that your journal log windows stores contains 5509-2474-3333-1120 and pin xxxx was used for ebay. catch my drift?
-------------------------
block
Even the relaxed was too strict. Even sites you link as trusted and allowed, may not function properly (i.e. Youtube videos may not load  until page is refreshed a few times). I would say NoScript for Firefox functions best, as once you label a site as trusted, it loads those widgets immediately instead of having to reload the page, allowing you too see what was/was not blocked.
-------------------------
block
Blacklist doesn't work. I want the default behavior to be "allow" except for certain domains that I explicitly blacklist. But when default behavior is "allow", the blacklist is ignored and content from blacklisted domains still gets loaded.  Setting default behavior to "block"  breaks most websites unless I whitelist each and every one of them individually, which is too much of a chore.
-------------------------
block
I really love the interface how you can allow/deny specific script domains on a page, however it does not list all of the scripts that get blocked. I assume it's when scripts are loaded dynamically from within other scripts and I can see how this would be difficult to accomplish programatically, but maybe it would be possible to add a button to "find other blocked scripts" which would load and parse the javascript in some sort of background sandbox and figuring out which URLs it is calling but without actually applying the scripts to the page. I have no idea if this could be possible, but it's an idea.

Also the support link above gives a 404.
-------------------------
block
Amazing 
Also block Anti-AD block scripts.
-------------------------
block
Probably this extension coupled with one of your other extensions.  It's about as light weight as it comes as far as extensions go.  But it does block pages by default, so if one of your other extensions were to say, rely on loading something from the web and timeout if it can't load it (which means that extension is horrible, because no extension should do this) then this extension would create a delay until you allowed the site it was trying to visit.
-------------------------
block
Using this addon is a huge chore.  I am constantly having to whitelist scripts in order to use a website normally, and even when I get the site working I later have to whitelist more resources.  It works horrendously on youtube in particular, due to the service's use of multiple content servers, so I have whitelist one or more servers every single time I view a youtube video.

On top of that, its web bug detection is flawed and produces false positives.  On FurAffinity, for example, it is falsely flagging all profile icons as webbugs.  Which wouldn't be a problem if there was a setting that disabled webbug blocking.  Actually, there is a setting to turn off webbug blocking, but changing it doesn't actually do anything.

And to top it all off, the support page links to a missing/non-existent google code page.  Ironically, this addon also prevents the page from showing you a 404 Error message!
-------------------------
detect
ScriptSafe is the most powerful intrusion blocker I have seen. I notice recently that Google searches stopped working. I don't know but suspect that Google has code to detect ScriptSafe and whether it is enabled. Maybe for Google's click revenues, certain scripts must be allowed. Rather than identify each required script individually, could be that Google's software requires that ScriptSafe be disabled completely. 
Therefore, if something like this is going on, we have no choice but to disable ScriptSafe, then re-enable ScriptSafe after clicking on one of Googles links. A nice update to ScriptSafe would be for ScriptSafe to disable and enable itself automatically for Google Searches and other search engines that kill themselves if ScriptSafe is enabled.

Worked pretty alright for a good amount of time.

Recently some pages will not function- even whitelisted without having to allow all blocked for session. Even then sometimes pages will not function correctly, and will only work correctly if ScriptSafe is turned off completely.

Also there is a major bug when using google search, as it will repeatedly trigger an "Aw Snap!" page error.

Liked it while it lasted, please update and fix bugs, thanks.

This extension is a powerful tool for the advanced (power) user. It is not suitable to install on your nontechnical relative's browser.

Once configured, Scriptsafe gives me excellent control over what scripts do and do not run on each page. It's a little shocking to find out how many tracker scripts are trying to run even after using other plugins to disable their tracker images and tracker cookies. 

On the first load of most websites, especially ones with logins, you will need to allow scripts from the main domain of the website, then click the X at the bottom of the scriptsafe box to reload the page, then check out the scriptsafe box to see what new scripts the old previously blocked scripts are trying to load. 

This process is iterative because many websites use scripts to call other scripts. It has to do with the way the web is built, not the way the plugin is built!

A lot of improvement is needed to the user interface, in addition to what others have said. It's confusing, and needs  to be simplified. It's behavior doesn't seem to be consistent.
Some addresses in the black list can still show up, as if they were not blocked.
-------------------------

Even when scriptsafe says  the site has loaded no resources, or when I trust/allow everything I see most websites are still unusable. The same goes with using the "Allow All Blocked For Session" button. Many things still do not function on most websites.

So far, it totally blocks FB. I want to prevent "stuff" not the entire site!

Love it. Used it to block adware I couldn't get rid of any other way, stops pop-ups and malware before they even show up, can't recommend enough. Only issue is that when I'm trying to do something within a website, I have to do trial&error to see which one is the script I'm looking for.
-------------------------

Had a reoccurring problem over the last month - ScriptSafe stops showing what scripts are running on a website and doesn't let me block anything.  

I can see in one other review that this is to do with Chrome 34.

App is great (5 stars) if it works, but seeing as it's stopped working twice in the last month, I have to reduce my rating to 3 stars... almost gave it 2.

this add-on works well in most site. however, for some financial site(banks), it fail to pass through JS code that require by the site. even if you add the site to whitelist. it seems the add-on still blocking something, no matter whats rules you setting.
and perhaps this is most problem of this add-on, it don't show you what it actually blocked.

after update to new version, it works perfect!

Its really not that great. Noscript for firefox is so much better. Sure, this blocks scripts. But good luck actually allowing scripts  for websites you visit and want scripts to run on. Even setting a domain as "trusted" means it only allows that BASE LEVEL domain script to run - you have to manually allow all the other scripts that run on the page still, EVERY single time. And god forbid if a website has hundreds of small, dynamic scripts that run, because you need to allow each and every one manually every time you visit the page. Or you just run with scriptsafe off, which defeats the whole point. Some websites, despite only having a few scripts and allowing them all as "trusted", still don't work unless I disable scriptsafe due to it auto-blocking certain web-bugs with me not able to say "Uh no, actually, I know this website is fine, let me allow it". Meanwhile, noscript for firefox? If you make a website trusted, all scripts that run on that domain run unless you individually block some of them. Setting the website for "Allow" on noscript gets most of the basic scripts running but third party ones (like ads) do not. Setting it so you temporarily want scripts from actually gives that page full temporary scripting access to your browser, instead of needing to manually do it to each and every little script on the website. Why can't scriptsafe do this?
-------------------------

it does work for the most part, but awful when trying to add pages to a temp list or allow blocked for session. making important sites next to impossible to go to. forces me to disable (and then forget i have done so)

After the recent update(s) my opinion of this extension has dropped quite a bit. Although formally quite useful this extension has started to become more hassle than it's worth. I have identified it as the cause of multiple legitimate, even popular, sites being completely blocked without any notice or warning. Only by disabling extensions one-by-one was I able to figure out which extension was responsible and still have no idea why those sites were blocked.
-------------------------

The syncing issues seem to all be worked out.  Kudos to the developer for writing and maintaining this extension.  I would not have switched to Chrome without script blocking.
-------------------------

I installed it so I could read The Independent since they instituted a weak paywall; but now it blocks the Guardian. Not just bits, but the whole site. It also pops up notifications on its own schedule, which runs counter to the reason for its existence.
-------------------------
block
After the shambles of the latest release wiping out all settings on several machines, none of them having being synced, it's difficult to have full confidence in ScriptSafe's ability to do its job effectively.

ALL settings were lost, meaning NO protection.  What's worse, this happened over a period when the machines were unmanned, and the update occurred without any notification.  The update was only noticed after visiting a site that successfully accessed items that should've been blocked by the blacklist..

I don't appreciate being forced to beta-test new versions when the existing version worked just fine.  This should've been released as a separate extension to those who wanted that functionality and are prepared to take the associated risks.

Not amused at having to reset the settings...

Is there any way to approve webbugs on certain cites?  I like the idea of blocking hidden scripts, but some sites might need those WEBBUG's in order to work (such as amazon's universal wishlist).

Otherwise a great app.
-------------------------

Good idea, but...

1. Extension broke "Referer" field in the HTTP requests header by shorting it(Why?) that prevent to access content on sites where hot linking protection activated.

2. It doesn't block Flash content which is more dangerous than JS.

3. It is matter of preference of course, but  IMHO control panel is confusing. For example - meaning of "Trust". Why not operate in established terms - "Host" for example instead of "Allow". "Whole Domain" instead of "Trust" and so on.
-------------------------
block
It would be great if I did not have to constantly disable it because it does not allow me to whitelist certain domains, such as Last.fm. (It continues to block pages that allow me to actually *listen* to Last.fm.)Why not give people the option to allow specific _pages_ via the pop-up icon?
-------------------------
block
Great extension -- a long-needed addition to Chrome, security-conscious power users finally have a real equivalent to NoScript for FF.  The only downside is that the NoScript interface is still more intuitive -- ScriptNo doesn't always start by showing you the full list of blocked elements, some seem to show up/disappear sporadically or only after the primary domain is whitelisted.  I'm sure this will get better with time and may be due to API limitations -- keep up the great work!
-------------------------
block
Great to block JS but comes with some questionable defaults. Specifically, the "Referrer Spoof" option. This changes the HTTP referal header and will break pages that use this header to redirect after an action. This shouldn't be enabled by default.

ads - 14
popup
I've been using it for a long time now to block ads and other unwanted content. It's not perfect, but it's great. There are moments where it seems to have like a hundred things to block or unblock, but it's tolerable.

Right now, however, I am experiencing a popup on my homepage "chrome://apps/" where it detects that I have things synched to Google and asks for permission to do so every time I launch Chrome even though I have it set not to provide that popup.
-------------------------
popup
I really like ScriptSafe it's just about perfect for my needs. But there is one thing that I do not like and hope there is a workaround for it. The issue is when you are blocking things on a image site like imagebam foe example you can not click the image to zoom in. If I disable ScriptSafe I can zoom in on the image. But of course then I may also get nasty popups. Is there anyway to block the site but enable zooming in on images?
-------------------------
cdn
This extension blocks ajax.googleapis.com which is necessary for websites that use Google's jQuery (and other libraries) CDN- that's a lot of websites. This resource is not shown in the "external resources" pane of ScriptSafe, but it is ScriptSafe that blocks the resource (confirmed with Chrome's network inspector). ScriptSafe seemingly does not provide a way to allow this resource, despite it being necessary across the Internet. I've had to disable ScriptSafe entirely to get many webpages to work properly.
-------------------------

While the app did it's job, it did it to well. I wanted something that would stop the scripts from loading in an "overlay" above a flash player that I use on a website to watch TV shows on. They are borderline clickjacking, and had one that loaded over a 1000 tabs, crashed my computer even with adblocker and avg running, each time a tab finished loading it opened a new one, each time I closed one two more opened in their place with crap I had to click click click out of to close that one. I ended up having to use taskmanger to get out, even CTRL+F4 didn't work. Well, ScriptSafe blocked the video embeded frame, and doesn't let me whitelist the video and frame and block the ads that are overlays of the flash player. Even though they are not hosted by the player's hosting site and have separate hosting URLs. I ended up using uMatrix. While it did block the embeded frame the video played in, I was able to white list that and that only. The popups didn't completely go away, but they no longer load ad/spam content that can crash my computer again. Instead the popup window opens, and a notice that it was blocked by uMatrix is in it's place and no further action was required. I liked ScriptSafe for what it did, but it's just to inflexible for what I wanted and didn't have enough user functionality to get me to the point I wanted to be at with my browsing. Since I live in an area that doesn't have broadcast TV, and I can't afford the expensive cost of cable or satellite, I depend on that site to watch my broadcast TV.
-------------------------
popup
After installing this and finding it broke a LOT of websites for me, forcing me to manually go through and pick the 2 or 3 things i NEEDED to allow that it was blocking, important stuff like login popups and such, i removed it. Well, now chrome wont remember ANY of my logins even after removing this. I even went so far as to go through settings and manually make sure everything was being allowed, but apparently this extension changed something fundamental to the point every website now requires a login on EVERY visit.
-------------------------
popup
It does an excellent jobs when it works. However, I receive a copious amount of reports of webbugs, which seems to hamper some websites' functionality. It's also horrible for handling captchas or similar functions used as pop-ups, because there's no way to bring up the scriptsafe icon to list the domains you want to allow. This is especially handicapping for sites like ticketmaster and evite. I couldn't even download adobe reader.

Used to be the best NoScript equivalent that had served me reliably for years.  Latest updates have pretty much ruined it.  Hare-brained attempts to sync white/black lists routinely wipe out all of my settings.  This in addition to flooding me with annoying pop-up messages with info and apologizing for screwing things up.  

While syncing is a nice idea; if done poorly as in this case it only ruins 
things.    

Shame to lose this extension like this.. off to look for alternatives.

fingerprinting - 3
fingerprint
I wish the developer would just stick to fingerprint and script protection and clean out the crud from his codebase. But this all seems unlikely since the developer looks to have given up.
-------------------------
fingerprint
I tested it on amiunique.org; the issues I had were, I had to allow scripts on that site to run in order to perform the test. As the only extension running, the following did not work for some reason: It did not randomize my time zone, nor my user agent, and it showed my list of plug-ins, and my hash tracking. I allowed it on panopticlick and it protected against some things, but not against fingerprinting, even though I had all fingerprinting options enabled. I am not sure why it didn't work as expected. Not behind a proxy and only used this extension.
-------------------------
fingerprint
It actually works. I tried it with Blank canvas reading it seems to generate random numbers every time. amiunique.org reports every time that I am unique, but it's the only browser fingerprint out of whatever-number-it-is that they collected. So every request that you send is unique but not repeatable.
Overall, very good job, Developer! I used NoScript before, but with Chrome it often doesn't work properly.

Love the functionality.  However, sometimes pages would take 30s or more to load.  I finally started disabling extensions and discovered that it is this extension causing the issue.  I have hundreds of whitelisted domains, which is probably the reason for the issue.
-------------------------
load
Extension does not block content on first load in Chrome/Chromium. After the extension is passed the web content (it pops in on the page then gets blocked afterwards) it will pass it though the ruleset. 

Could be a glitch, but I noticed it the most on weather.com. The extension also needs script specific blocking with heuristics and signatures so I can select which scripts from what domain are loaded.

My previous belief was that this was adequate to block zero-day exploits against webkit and renderer exploits or some other bloatware feature of the browser, but it is not.

Annoying to use as of late. It very aggressively disables many many scripts which doesn't allow a lot of sites to work properly. So expect to be manually pressing that "allow" button for countless elements every time u want to visit a new page, or worse, if that new page has dynamic elements with unique names, you'll have to manually allow that element every time you reload the page. Too aggressive. Don't know why the devs made it this way.

I use JSBlocker with Safari. Its a dream compared to this mess. Unfortunately not available for Chrome.

With ScriptSafe: Pages don't load. Page functionality is compromised. The developers simply block just about everything as a default, even though some of what's blocked is basic site functionality.

For about a month now I'm having one site after another not be able to load at all. A blank page is what I get. Open  same page in Safari, no problems.

Now deleted. A totally overrated extension.

I don't use the Internet without it. I won't use the Internet without it. I do not understand how anyone can believe they are safely browsing the Internet without it.

If you thought loading a web page, perhaps your favorite newspaper, for instance, was a simple, two-way communication between your web browser and your newspaper's "server", then please take the time to re-evaluate. Nearly every web page is a sick intersection of tracking, marketing, and content delivery networks - all vectors for compromise - that your browser happily taints you with.

If you like walking naked, with a blind fold, in public, then waste no time learning how to navigate the web with a script blocker. If you care about your Internet hygiene, then look no further. Donate as you can and be grateful that this kind of transparency is possible.

Totally breaks websites that you must log into. After I installed it, I couldn't access my streaming media sites and when I couldn't log into Evernote, I realized it must be the new extension. I disabled it and now my Chrome works again.

-------------------------
bug
I agree with some of the recent reviews, in that ScriptSafe works a little to well in blocking scripts and potentially malicious code on websites. There's something broken though, so that I can't enable parts (Allow/Trust) of sites I _do_ want to use. Also, it shows in red how many items were blocked, but for some reason there's no way to view those items. Something must have bugged since Chrome or this extension updated. Removing, but would come back to it if it gets fixed.

This is the best of the NoScript substitutes for Chrome BUT…

• NO hotkey
• No single-click toggling with the icon
• I have to escape out of the dialog to refresh the  page. I see no reason why it doesn't refresh immediately.

The whole process of using this extension is annoying, tedious, and slow. Click icon. Select option using trackpad--NO keyboard access!  Click in blank area or hit <esc> to refresh.  Usually this has to be repeated at least once since new sites to enable pop up.

I temporarily allow js for most sites, and I usually have to enable js at least once again on most sites, so all of the above just make using this a slow, annoying, tedious, multi-click process.

Needs work…
-------------------------
bug
Don't have a Git account so I'll post this here. I really like this extension and have used it for years, but with one of the recent updates I no longer seem to be able to block doubleclick.net, either manually or while visiting pages that display its ads.

In addition, I feel the removal of showing what resources are currently blocked and allowed when a page is fully "clean" and you click ScriptSafe's icon is a terrible step backwards. (I recognize this could also be a bug, as some pages still show it while others have a completely blank ScriptSafe dropdown.)

I've decided to just completely clear my whitelist and blacklist. It seems there were just too many entries from the pre-full domain support period before the new updates. Performing better now as well, though it looks like distrusted resources still don't always appear in ScriptSafe on certain pages.
-------------------------
bug
Thanks for this, that does sound like a bug as the panel should show everything that is blocked/allowed. Do you remember which page this occurred on? I'll modify the behaviour in the next update so any domains explicitly blocked will not be accessible. Will test for a day or two before releasing.
-------------------------
break
After the last update, the page does not open as expected, you have to wait for 5 minutes, it's not a joke, 5 minutes each, breaks the design structure of the site. During all this years, there were no problems. Now I'll have to say goodbye to this utility.Constant freezes or problems with the sites, plus the increased load on the powerful processor. Everything is new does not mean better. Sorry
-------------------------
break
Why am I using an extension when it blatantly ignores my notification settings and breaks sites that need scripting even when I whitelist them?
-------------------------
access
Lets not do that unless its a feature disabled by default.  What most seriously security concious people want out of this is more than just blocking potential malicious code. Its also about anonymity on the web. Java and other forms of code can still track you even on precious sites like Youtube, Facebook, Google, and especially sites like Youtube Facebook and Google. Its not a bad feature but it would be pointless for me to spend the last 14 hours wiping out any possible hint of what can be tracked and identified as me even using my desktop only to start chrome and be traced throughout every "uprated" site I go on. You also have the problem of casual users sending erroneous data back and having sites falsely whitelisted. Joe schmoe and his 14 pals all did it to a website they made with a 0day exploit and then paid google to get it around town. Now you've opened up the page and get an applet drive by and your system is compromised by a backdoor shell. Joe has root access (or admin access for windows users) and can see that your journal log windows stores contains 5509-2474-3333-1120 and pin xxxx was used for ebay. catch my drift?
-------------------------
reload
Even the relaxed was too strict. Even sites you link as trusted and allowed, may not function properly (i.e. Youtube videos may not load  until page is refreshed a few times). I would say NoScript for Firefox functions best, as once you label a site as trusted, it loads those widgets immediately instead of having to reload the page, allowing you too see what was/was not blocked.
-------------------------
break
Blacklist doesn't work. I want the default behavior to be "allow" except for certain domains that I explicitly blacklist. But when default behavior is "allow", the blacklist is ignored and content from blacklisted domains still gets loaded.  Setting default behavior to "block"  breaks most websites unless I whitelist each and every one of them individually, which is too much of a chore.

I really love the interface how you can allow/deny specific script domains on a page, however it does not list all of the scripts that get blocked. I assume it's when scripts are loaded dynamically from within other scripts and I can see how this would be difficult to accomplish programatically, but maybe it would be possible to add a button to "find other blocked scripts" which would load and parse the javascript in some sort of background sandbox and figuring out which URLs it is calling but without actually applying the scripts to the page. I have no idea if this could be possible, but it's an idea.

Also the support link above gives a 404.
-------------------------
load
Probably this extension coupled with one of your other extensions.  It's about as light weight as it comes as far as extensions go.  But it does block pages by default, so if one of your other extensions were to say, rely on loading something from the web and timeout if it can't load it (which means that extension is horrible, because no extension should do this) then this extension would create a delay until you allowed the site it was trying to visit.
-------------------------
error
Using this addon is a huge chore.  I am constantly having to whitelist scripts in order to use a website normally, and even when I get the site working I later have to whitelist more resources.  It works horrendously on youtube in particular, due to the service's use of multiple content servers, so I have whitelist one or more servers every single time I view a youtube video.

On top of that, its web bug detection is flawed and produces false positives.  On FurAffinity, for example, it is falsely flagging all profile icons as webbugs.  Which wouldn't be a problem if there was a setting that disabled webbug blocking.  Actually, there is a setting to turn off webbug blocking, but changing it doesn't actually do anything.

And to top it all off, the support page links to a missing/non-existent google code page.  Ironically, this addon also prevents the page from showing you a 404 Error message!

stop
ScriptSafe is the most powerful intrusion blocker I have seen. I notice recently that Google searches stopped working. I don't know but suspect that Google has code to detect ScriptSafe and whether it is enabled. Maybe for Google's click revenues, certain scripts must be allowed. Rather than identify each required script individually, could be that Google's software requires that ScriptSafe be disabled completely. 
Therefore, if something like this is going on, we have no choice but to disable ScriptSafe, then re-enable ScriptSafe after clicking on one of Googles links. A nice update to ScriptSafe would be for ScriptSafe to disable and enable itself automatically for Google Searches and other search engines that kill themselves if ScriptSafe is enabled.

Extremely granular control of *every* resource that's being loaded on a page.  This plugin will require you to tinker with the settings multiple times for each page you're trying to get working.  (Essentially defeating the purpose of using this, if you're also concerned about privacy.)  

This extension basically breaks the web.

Worked pretty alright for a good amount of time.

Recently some pages will not function- even whitelisted without having to allow all blocked for session. Even then sometimes pages will not function correctly, and will only work correctly if ScriptSafe is turned off completely.

Also there is a major bug when using google search, as it will repeatedly trigger an "Aw Snap!" page error.

Liked it while it lasted, please update and fix bugs, thanks.

reload
This extension is a powerful tool for the advanced (power) user. It is not suitable to install on your nontechnical relative's browser.

Once configured, Scriptsafe gives me excellent control over what scripts do and do not run on each page. It's a little shocking to find out how many tracker scripts are trying to run even after using other plugins to disable their tracker images and tracker cookies. 

On the first load of most websites, especially ones with logins, you will need to allow scripts from the main domain of the website, then click the X at the bottom of the scriptsafe box to reload the page, then check out the scriptsafe box to see what new scripts the old previously blocked scripts are trying to load. 

This process is iterative because many websites use scripts to call other scripts. It has to do with the way the web is built, not the way the plugin is built!

Too many unfixed bugs and mis-features!

great way to control what is loaded in your browser but in the past few weeks has become the buggiest thing on my tech preview of win 10.

I kept wondering WHY Google was misbehaving. This App was actually great, but it seems like an update is needed ASAP. Not only for this issue, but for the Quota Bytes pop up as well. I hate to get rid of it, because it's so great, but it's stopping me from being able to search. hopefully there will be an update in the future. Until then, I have to give it two stars for current performance.

Worked great for a week. Then stopped. Just as I was bragging I had solved freezes and hangups on Chrome..they came back.
Why?
-------------------------
load
Work except often requires several "Trusts" or "Temps" as each one only permits the current visible layer of scripts (not the ones that are not loaded yet that will be after this click) so becomes more hard-work than it should. Also means that sometimes you blindly click "trust" anyway. Needs to be more user friendly.

NotScript was great...so bummed that it was removed from the ChromeStore...it was so much better (like NoScript in Firefox).

When you block or even temp allow certain sites, upon the auto reload of the website. Everything stays the same.

Seems like a good NoScript extension for chrome. However, this extension breaks Netflix so that I had to whitelist ever IP address associated with streaming each individual movie. NoScript on Firefox doesn't have this issue at all. This makes the ScriptSafe unusable since Netflix is where I consume the most media. Unless the author fixes this, I cannot use this extension.
-------------------------

Even when scriptsafe says  the site has loaded no resources, or when I trust/allow everything I see most websites are still unusable. The same goes with using the "Allow All Blocked For Session" button. Many things still do not function on most websites.

Added at least 500ms latency to all page loads. Did not properly show third party content the sites tried to load (from other domains).

NoScript for Firefox is the only reason I still use two browsers. Will continue my search for a NoScript replacement, this didn't make the mark.

It kinda works, but not quite as good as NoScript on Firefox.  In particualr, the ScriptSafe "Temp" button rarely works, forcing you to grant permanent permissions to some sites, and then manually remove them after, which is enough of a hassle that I usually just cut the website address and load it in Firefox instead, where NoScript's temporary permissions feature actually works.

Love it. Used it to block adware I couldn't get rid of any other way, stops pop-ups and malware before they even show up, can't recommend enough. Only issue is that when I'm trying to do something within a website, I have to do trial&error to see which one is the script I'm looking for.
-------------------------
stop
Been using this for a VERY long time.  Just recently however it has stopped working.  Just keeps saying there are no scripts on the page, when I know there is.

Only way around it is to uninstall/reinstall the extension, but after a reboot it stops working yet again.
-------------------------
stop
Had a reoccurring problem over the last month - ScriptSafe stops showing what scripts are running on a website and doesn't let me block anything.  

I can see in one other review that this is to do with Chrome 34.

App is great (5 stars) if it works, but seeing as it's stopped working twice in the last month, I have to reduce my rating to 3 stars... almost gave it 2.

love this thing, but MAJOR PROBLEM.

Chrome 34 broke it, and i doubt the Chrome team has this on a high priority, (maybe especially since it saps ad revenue...)

Major issue when using Google search. Scenario, I've pressed the next button and have navigated to page 2, 3 or more of the search results, I then click on a search link to visit a website, but upon pressing the 'back' button I am returned to the first page of my search rather than the actual search page I pressed the link on. If I disable all extensions, the problem goes away, but if I only enable Scriptsafe, the problem returns. If I disable Scriptsafe again, the problem goes away too. All 'resource' sites that Scriptsafe highlighted were given access, plus Google is on my whitelist, but still Google Search has problems. Other issues with Search, but not necessarily related to ScriptSafe, Google Search settings are ignored and never returns to the same point on a page if I have scrolled down from the top. Google Search works way better in Firefox than it does in Chrome, zero problems, even with a ton of add-ons, like NoScript. Slowly feel I'm edging back to Firefox. UPDATE! I've switched back to Firefox as my primary browser. I've always had issues and problems with Chrome, many more than with Firefox. Chrome was all shiny and new with hyped up marketing, but a lot of that gloss has worn off this past year with annoying issues.

Something is definitely off about ScriptSafe lately- a number of safe websites are taking forever to load- or not loading properly at all.
-------------------------

Its really not that great. Noscript for firefox is so much better. Sure, this blocks scripts. But good luck actually allowing scripts  for websites you visit and want scripts to run on. Even setting a domain as "trusted" means it only allows that BASE LEVEL domain script to run - you have to manually allow all the other scripts that run on the page still, EVERY single time. And god forbid if a website has hundreds of small, dynamic scripts that run, because you need to allow each and every one manually every time you visit the page. Or you just run with scriptsafe off, which defeats the whole point. Some websites, despite only having a few scripts and allowing them all as "trusted", still don't work unless I disable scriptsafe due to it auto-blocking certain web-bugs with me not able to say "Uh no, actually, I know this website is fine, let me allow it". Meanwhile, noscript for firefox? If you make a website trusted, all scripts that run on that domain run unless you individually block some of them. Setting the website for "Allow" on noscript gets most of the basic scripts running but third party ones (like ads) do not. Setting it so you temporarily want scripts from actually gives that page full temporary scripting access to your browser, instead of needing to manually do it to each and every little script on the website. Why can't scriptsafe do this?
-------------------------
reload
Besides the complaints other people have made, when I click on a Google search result and then click back, it shouldn't have to completely reload the search results page and take me to the top of the page as if I just typed the search in, it should take me to where I WAS--it does this to EVERYTHING.  I may end up having to switch back to Firefox, because NotScripts is terrible, and this is the only alternative. :(

Sorry this has really taken a turn for the worst.  Use to be a great add-on now all I seem to do is fight with it.

Used to be awesome. Then syncing was introduced, making it a little more awesome. THEN...1/1/13 update made me lose EVERYTHING!

Please bug check before going live. I lost everything. Import from last back not working.
-------------------------
access
After the shambles of the latest release wiping out all settings on several machines, none of them having being synced, it's difficult to have full confidence in ScriptSafe's ability to do its job effectively.

ALL settings were lost, meaning NO protection.  What's worse, this happened over a period when the machines were unmanned, and the update occurred without any notification.  The update was only noticed after visiting a site that successfully accessed items that should've been blocked by the blacklist..

I don't appreciate being forced to beta-test new versions when the existing version worked just fine.  This should've been released as a separate extension to those who wanted that functionality and are prepared to take the associated risks.

Not amused at having to reset the settings...

I've been a loyal user for a long time, but recently I'm having trouble accessing my DD-WRT router configuration site.

Good idea, but...

1. Extension broke "Referer" field in the HTTP requests header by shorting it(Why?) that prevent to access content on sites where hot linking protection activated.

2. It doesn't block Flash content which is more dangerous than JS.

3. It is matter of preference of course, but  IMHO control panel is confusing. For example - meaning of "Trust". Why not operate in established terms - "Host" for example instead of "Allow". "Whole Domain" instead of "Trust" and so on.
-------------------------
break
Great, but it breaks at least two of my extensions:

* FlashBlock
* Vimium

It has probably broken more. The old version used to work with them. If anything, this has taught me that Google Chrome should allow me to opt out of automatic extension updates.
-------------------------

Great to block JS but comes with some questionable defaults. Specifically, the "Referrer Spoof" option. This changes the HTTP referal header and will break pages that use this header to redirect after an action. This shouldn't be enabled by default.

It works nice! 
I am using this is very much like NoScript  on firefox. 
However, in the course of webdev over the years there is an increasing amount of use cases where important page elements simply disappear on a website when some site is not enabled. 

I believe this style of webpages are increasing, so what we really need is a shared database with a finer classifications of sites. 
I can imagine a kind of site-voting engine for script block users, so its easy to share the classification of a site and see classification from others.

In the end its about a quick decision to include frontend code from certrain sites, sometimes its needed, sometimes not, sometimes its essential! 

I encountered some bad examples where a checkout flow was missing very important parts.
So if sites which are known to create important content can be tagged, this information can be fed back to the script blocking extentions to support the user in the decision of enabling additional sources.

I see a few different approaches to move forward:
-an integrated evaluation scheme to simplify classification of javascript servers
- maybe even a computation intensive black box approach where the code is executed in a box and the difference to the DOM is evaluated to judge the impact

I think the users of this plugin are a really good user group to discuss  this! :)
-------------------------
javascript
Does not allow blocking of individual scripts within a domain or sub-domain.

The number in parenthesis in front of a domain/sub-domain shows the number of scripts within that domain/sub-domain, and mouse over shows those url's, but those javascripts can not be selected to allow or block.

If I wanted to block a script, I would have to block the entire domain/sub-domain.

Also, if you block a subdomain, on one site, it blocks it globally, add **.adservice.google.com to the blacklist and it's blocked on every site in existence, including google.com.

What should happen is if I block a subdomain that's running scripts on a domain, it should be blocked ONLY on that domain,,

EG, if adservice.google.com is being blocked on say testsite.com, then that subdomain shold ONLY be blocked on testingsite.com ONLY, and not blocked globally across any domain.
-------------------------
javascript
Yep, you have to keep marking trust the sites, but after a while you get most of the sites you go to regularly happily whitelisted. Also, you can get the all the information you need from  the majority of niche sites without javascript. It's a small price to pay to keep your computer safe from most browse attack vectors without the need for CPU-sucking av software.

I used to this hotkey to temporary allow javascript for one webpage, when I use firefox with noscript
-------------------------

I really love the interface how you can allow/deny specific script domains on a page, however it does not list all of the scripts that get blocked. I assume it's when scripts are loaded dynamically from within other scripts and I can see how this would be difficult to accomplish programatically, but maybe it would be possible to add a button to "find other blocked scripts" which would load and parse the javascript in some sort of background sandbox and figuring out which URLs it is calling but without actually applying the scripts to the page. I have no idea if this could be possible, but it's an idea.

Also the support link above gives a 404.
-------------------------

Good extension. Good interface. Likeable socialize feature. But things are missing:

- The possibility to choose the domain level. 

- All scripts from source (not javascript) that are expressed in sites source.

- Sometime the interface does not unfold.

Perfect against the current fad of news-pages sliding in an Ad from the right as you're reading. With this addon, they slide their junk into my face one time, and they lose the privilege to run JavaScript on my computer (yes, Ad-makers: the privilege. Running code on my computer is not your right. It is a privilege that, with this addon, I can remove from you again).

Thank you!

One little note: You still name your addon ScriptSafe when you hover over it, and when you ask if you want to add devices for syncing. That was majorly confusing, since I did not know of an addon "ScriptSafe" that I had installed (only "ScriptNo").

Annoying to use as of late. It very aggressively disables many many scripts which doesn't allow a lot of sites to work properly. So expect to be manually pressing that "allow" button for countless elements every time u want to visit a new page, or worse, if that new page has dynamic elements with unique names, you'll have to manually allow that element every time you reload the page. Too aggressive. Don't know why the devs made it this way.

Chrome Crashed, and the Recover feature didn't work because of this. I was in the middle of a bunch of things, and thanks to this program I can't find my place.

I shouldn't have to whitelist chrome itself, as I obviously trust it enough to run it.

It really needs a global whitelist, you can grab from other sources. Everytime I try it out I have to add things manually, which is rather inefficient, and annoying.

Very useful, but has some serious flaws.  Some websites (like http://www.marathon-photos.com/) even after you've trusted/allowed all scripts it still does not allow the page to display correctly.  You have to completely disable the extension  to view the page.  This brings us to the main flaw.  When you disable the extension you are disabling it for every tab you have open. There needs to be a "Disable on this Page/tab" option so that you don't have completely turn off the extension.

After installing this and finding it broke a LOT of websites for me, forcing me to manually go through and pick the 2 or 3 things i NEEDED to allow that it was blocking, important stuff like login popups and such, i removed it. Well, now chrome wont remember ANY of my logins even after removing this. I even went so far as to go through settings and manually make sure everything was being allowed, but apparently this extension changed something fundamental to the point every website now requires a login on EVERY visit.

I'm a long time user of this extension, but the author has succumbed to the industry practice of 'improving' the product to the point where all of its original elegant simplicity and ease-of-use has disappeared under a cumbersome list of options and an ever changing UI.
I call it Google syndrome although it's a common affliction of many software developers.
I am not interested in spending an hour or more re-learning a program/extension, its interface, new operating requirements, etc.
Before I had a quick option to block allow everything on a site... now that button is gone and I seem unable to individually get blocked elements to work temporarily.
If you are going to change things simply for the sake of change, at least give us an easy option to revert back to a previous version and turn off auto-update. Auto-update turned off should the default.

Don't have a Git account so I'll post this here. I really like this extension and have used it for years, but with one of the recent updates I no longer seem to be able to block doubleclick.net, either manually or while visiting pages that display its ads.

In addition, I feel the removal of showing what resources are currently blocked and allowed when a page is fully "clean" and you click ScriptSafe's icon is a terrible step backwards. (I recognize this could also be a bug, as some pages still show it while others have a completely blank ScriptSafe dropdown.)

I've decided to just completely clear my whitelist and blacklist. It seems there were just too many entries from the pre-full domain support period before the new updates. Performing better now as well, though it looks like distrusted resources still don't always appear in ScriptSafe on certain pages.
-------------------------

I appreciate the feedback. A "Show Update Notification" option was recently added, giving you control over notifications (the other existing option controls if the update changelog page appears). Also a fix for the "Respect Same-Domain" mode will come in the next update when Google finishes manually reviewing the update I pushed.

What extensions like these need is reputation scoring. If a script is on a list of scripts that belongs to sites that have very high rep because they don't distribute viruses or track their customers then there should be an option to set scripts like that to allowed by default.
Basically if a script is important to a site's functionality and doesn't do anything nasty then you could (completely optionally and anonymously) send of a rating of five stars back to the developer. (but only if they are rated, otherwise it should send nothing)
The ratings would then be compiled into a list with the overall rating of all sites visited and sent off in each update to the extension in everyone browser. Scripts with four or more stars would be allowed by default, scripts with less or no reputation yet would need permission and scripts with two or less would have a warning you need to click through to enable, because they're probably bad.

I've posted this in a few places because I wanted to get the idea out.
I would've made this suggestion on your support site but couldn't find the option to post there.

sync functionality is annoying and seems very manual, instead of just updating from the server once it's enabled and synching back on update. I get the choices for to/from for initial synch but once you start it seems like it wouldn't be that hard to simply push updates (it is more complicated with that but not much, you could ask what to do on conflict).
-------------------------
manual
Does what it says, but the UI needs more polish.

Notable annoyances:

- 'Distrusted' domains are mixed in with the auto-denied domains. You very often need to enable a script to make a site work, but have to manually ignore the distrusted scripts when looking for what to allow.

- Allowed scripts appear redder than disallowed, because the selected action (green-allow vs red-deny) is grayed out instead of colored in when selected.
-------------------------

Using this addon is a huge chore.  I am constantly having to whitelist scripts in order to use a website normally, and even when I get the site working I later have to whitelist more resources.  It works horrendously on youtube in particular, due to the service's use of multiple content servers, so I have whitelist one or more servers every single time I view a youtube video.

On top of that, its web bug detection is flawed and produces false positives.  On FurAffinity, for example, it is falsely flagging all profile icons as webbugs.  Which wouldn't be a problem if there was a setting that disabled webbug blocking.  Actually, there is a setting to turn off webbug blocking, but changing it doesn't actually do anything.

And to top it all off, the support page links to a missing/non-existent google code page.  Ironically, this addon also prevents the page from showing you a 404 Error message!

Used to be the best NoScript equivalent that had served me reliably for years.  Latest updates have pretty much ruined it.  Hare-brained attempts to sync white/black lists routinely wipe out all of my settings.  This in addition to flooding me with annoying pop-up messages with info and apologizing for screwing things up.  

While syncing is a nice idea; if done poorly as in this case it only ruins 
things.    

Shame to lose this extension like this.. off to look for alternatives.

Great extension and happy that there's finally a Chrome equivalent to NoScript on Firefox. 

My only request for the makers, is for an option to hide (and/or make visible) all the scripts/sites that have been checked off. It gets a bit annoying to constantly see sites that I have already checked off as Distrust. There have been a couple of times that I accidentally clicked Allow on a Distrusted site thinking for a second that it was new and I had not marked it already.

The flip-side of this problem is that there is no way to view all the scripts/sites I had previously Allowed other than going into the options to look at my entire list. This does not help considering I do not have any clue which site/script may be tied to the site I am currently on.

Nonetheless, if this issue can be rectified, I will come back and give this extension the 5 stars it deserves.

It works! Requires knowledge of when and what to whitelist in certain sites, but that comes with the territory of using an extension like this.
-------------------------

Love the functionality.  However, sometimes pages would take 30s or more to load.  I finally started disabling extensions and discovered that it is this extension causing the issue.  I have hundreds of whitelisted domains, which is probably the reason for the issue.
-------------------------
whitelist
Block youtube comments and likes sections, even if avarything is whitelisted!
-------------------------
blacklist
Does not allow blocking of individual scripts within a domain or sub-domain.

The number in parenthesis in front of a domain/sub-domain shows the number of scripts within that domain/sub-domain, and mouse over shows those url's, but those javascripts can not be selected to allow or block.

If I wanted to block a script, I would have to block the entire domain/sub-domain.

Also, if you block a subdomain, on one site, it blocks it globally, add **.adservice.google.com to the blacklist and it's blocked on every site in existence, including google.com.

What should happen is if I block a subdomain that's running scripts on a domain, it should be blocked ONLY on that domain,,

EG, if adservice.google.com is being blocked on say testsite.com, then that subdomain shold ONLY be blocked on testingsite.com ONLY, and not blocked globally across any domain.
-------------------------
whitelist
You need to whitelist every domain that you visit.

I tested it on amiunique.org; the issues I had were, I had to allow scripts on that site to run in order to perform the test. As the only extension running, the following did not work for some reason: It did not randomize my time zone, nor my user agent, and it showed my list of plug-ins, and my hash tracking. I allowed it on panopticlick and it protected against some things, but not against fingerprinting, even though I had all fingerprinting options enabled. I am not sure why it didn't work as expected. Not behind a proxy and only used this extension.
-------------------------

Yep, you have to keep marking trust the sites, but after a while you get most of the sites you go to regularly happily whitelisted. Also, you can get the all the information you need from  the majority of niche sites without javascript. It's a small price to pay to keep your computer safe from most browse attack vectors without the need for CPU-sucking av software.

It just started blocking anything google related lately. The tabs that try to open google services will simply not load at all. Disabling ScriptSafe makes them load again just fine, and Google is added to whitelist as well.

This Chrome extension is a great replacement for NoScript 10 with Firefox 57 Quantum released in the last day with issues https://hackademix.net/2017/11/14/double-noscript/ .  Like the old NoScript 5 for Firefox, ScriptSafe for Chrome found very intuitive setting up to individually allow or not multiple scripts per website and a temporary allow option, all with simple clicking.  The list of scripts allowed or not can also conveniently be exported or later imported for backup purposes.
-------------------------
whitelist
Also a long time user. With every update to Scriptsafe (and there have been A LOT lately), I have to re-trust or re-allow all my websites that I go to (and all their utilities and all their affiliates and all their social).  This is really really annoying.  Please leave our whitelists intact.
-------------------------
blacklist
If you add a website to blacklist it blocks that website entirely, not just blocking the scripts..

It blocks TOO much, by default. Also, and this may just be a me thing, but when I look at the list of things I can block, I can't tell what those things ARE on the page.
-------------------------

It is definitely a 'you' thing. Anything not on the domain should not be whitelisted and they can potentially load malicious scripts into an otherwise safe website like new sites.

Chrome Crashed, and the Recover feature didn't work because of this. I was in the middle of a bunch of things, and thanks to this program I can't find my place. It may be more efficient to document every site I visit while researching things, but that would be incredibly slow. Now this software is garbage to me. I shouldn't have to whitelist chrome itself, as I obviously trust it enough to run it.

It really needs a global whitelist, you can grab from other sources. Everytime I try it out I have to add things manually, which is rather inefficient, and annoying.

While the app did it's job, it did it to well. I wanted something that would stop the scripts from loading in an "overlay" above a flash player that I use on a website to watch TV shows on. They are borderline clickjacking, and had one that loaded over a 1000 tabs, crashed my computer even with adblocker and avg running, each time a tab finished loading it opened a new one, each time I closed one two more opened in their place with crap I had to click click click out of to close that one. I ended up having to use taskmanger to get out, even CTRL+F4 didn't work. Well, ScriptSafe blocked the video embeded frame, and doesn't let me whitelist the video and frame and block the ads that are overlays of the flash player. Even though they are not hosted by the player's hosting site and have separate hosting URLs. I ended up using uMatrix. While it did block the embeded frame the video played in, I was able to white list that and that only. The popups didn't completely go away, but they no longer load ad/spam content that can crash my computer again. Instead the popup window opens, and a notice that it was blocked by uMatrix is in it's place and no further action was required. I liked ScriptSafe for what it did, but it's just to inflexible for what I wanted and didn't have enough user functionality to get me to the point I wanted to be at with my browsing. Since I live in an area that doesn't have broadcast TV, and I can't afford the expensive cost of cable or satellite, I depend on that site to watch my broadcast TV.

I'm a long time user of this extension, but the author has succumbed to the industry practice of 'improving' the product to the point where all of its original elegant simplicity and ease-of-use has disappeared under a cumbersome list of options and an ever changing UI.
I call it Google syndrome although it's a common affliction of many software developers.
I am not interested in spending an hour or more re-learning a program/extension, its interface, new operating requirements, etc.
Before I had a quick option to block allow everything on a site... now that button is gone and I seem unable to individually get blocked elements to work temporarily.
If you are going to change things simply for the sake of change, at least give us an easy option to revert back to a previous version and turn off auto-update. Auto-update turned off should the default.

Ok, i'll get the beta version, and maybe I had a really large list?

Don't have a Git account so I'll post this here. I really like this extension and have used it for years, but with one of the recent updates I no longer seem to be able to block doubleclick.net, either manually or while visiting pages that display its ads.

In addition, I feel the removal of showing what resources are currently blocked and allowed when a page is fully "clean" and you click ScriptSafe's icon is a terrible step backwards. (I recognize this could also be a bug, as some pages still show it while others have a completely blank ScriptSafe dropdown.)

I've decided to just completely clear my whitelist and blacklist. It seems there were just too many entries from the pre-full domain support period before the new updates. Performing better now as well, though it looks like distrusted resources still don't always appear in ScriptSafe on certain pages.
-------------------------
whitelist
Why am I using an extension when it blatantly ignores my notification settings and breaks sites that need scripting even when I whitelist them?
-------------------------
list
What extensions like these need is reputation scoring. If a script is on a list of scripts that belongs to sites that have very high rep because they don't distribute viruses or track their customers then there should be an option to set scripts like that to allowed by default.
Basically if a script is important to a site's functionality and doesn't do anything nasty then you could (completely optionally and anonymously) send of a rating of five stars back to the developer. (but only if they are rated, otherwise it should send nothing)
The ratings would then be compiled into a list with the overall rating of all sites visited and sent off in each update to the extension in everyone browser. Scripts with four or more stars would be allowed by default, scripts with less or no reputation yet would need permission and scripts with two or less would have a warning you need to click through to enable, because they're probably bad.

I've posted this in a few places because I wanted to get the idea out.
I would've made this suggestion on your support site but couldn't find the option to post there.
-------------------------

Lets not do that unless its a feature disabled by default.  What most seriously security concious people want out of this is more than just blocking potential malicious code. Its also about anonymity on the web. Java and other forms of code can still track you even on precious sites like Youtube, Facebook, Google, and especially sites like Youtube Facebook and Google. Its not a bad feature but it would be pointless for me to spend the last 14 hours wiping out any possible hint of what can be tracked and identified as me even using my desktop only to start chrome and be traced throughout every "uprated" site I go on. You also have the problem of casual users sending erroneous data back and having sites falsely whitelisted. Joe schmoe and his 14 pals all did it to a website they made with a 0day exploit and then paid google to get it around town. Now you've opened up the page and get an applet drive by and your system is compromised by a backdoor shell. Joe has root access (or admin access for windows users) and can see that your journal log windows stores contains 5509-2474-3333-1120 and pin xxxx was used for ebay. catch my drift?
-------------------------
whitelist
Blacklist doesn't work. I want the default behavior to be "allow" except for certain domains that I explicitly blacklist. But when default behavior is "allow", the blacklist is ignored and content from blacklisted domains still gets loaded.  Setting default behavior to "block"  breaks most websites unless I whitelist each and every one of them individually, which is too much of a chore.

This extension caused nothing but problems on my Windows 10 laptop. It completely stopped me from being able to login to my Facebook, Hotmail, and Comcast accounts until I removed it from my list of Chrome extensions.
-------------------------

I really love the interface how you can allow/deny specific script domains on a page, however it does not list all of the scripts that get blocked. I assume it's when scripts are loaded dynamically from within other scripts and I can see how this would be difficult to accomplish programatically, but maybe it would be possible to add a button to "find other blocked scripts" which would load and parse the javascript in some sort of background sandbox and figuring out which URLs it is calling but without actually applying the scripts to the page. I have no idea if this could be possible, but it's an idea.

Also the support link above gives a 404.
-------------------------
list
A pre-filled white list would be useful. Also the settings (lists) are not being carried over different instances of chrome
-------------------------

Using this addon is a huge chore.  I am constantly having to whitelist scripts in order to use a website normally, and even when I get the site working I later have to whitelist more resources.  It works horrendously on youtube in particular, due to the service's use of multiple content servers, so I have whitelist one or more servers every single time I view a youtube video.

On top of that, its web bug detection is flawed and produces false positives.  On FurAffinity, for example, it is falsely flagging all profile icons as webbugs.  Which wouldn't be a problem if there was a setting that disabled webbug blocking.  Actually, there is a setting to turn off webbug blocking, but changing it doesn't actually do anything.

And to top it all off, the support page links to a missing/non-existent google code page.  Ironically, this addon also prevents the page from showing you a 404 Error message!
-------------------------
whitelist
Going to have to disagree with you.  I've use this extension on youtube for years without issue.  I haven't had to whitelist anything Youtube related in recent memory.  I think you are not using the trust button, which you probably should for youtube.com, google.com, ytimg.com and all the other Google related sites that Youtube uses (other than maybe googleanalytics).  Otherwise, you probably are going to be whitelisting them forever.
-------------------------

Worked pretty alright for a good amount of time.

Recently some pages will not function- even whitelisted without having to allow all blocked for session. Even then sometimes pages will not function correctly, and will only work correctly if ScriptSafe is turned off completely.

Also there is a major bug when using google search, as it will repeatedly trigger an "Aw Snap!" page error.

Liked it while it lasted, please update and fix bugs, thanks.

I would like to see a sort function on the white/blacklists. These lists get very long, and sometimes I just want to undo something, but can't find it.

It does an excellent jobs when it works. However, I receive a copious amount of reports of webbugs, which seems to hamper some websites' functionality. It's also horrible for handling captchas or similar functions used as pop-ups, because there's no way to bring up the scriptsafe icon to list the domains you want to allow. This is especially handicapping for sites like ticketmaster and evite. I couldn't even download adobe reader.

You set up a whitelist wildcard for domains but you won't allow a wildcard for IP addresses.

A lot of improvement is needed to the user interface, in addition to what others have said. It's confusing, and needs  to be simplified. It's behavior doesn't seem to be consistent.
Some addresses in the black list can still show up, as if they were not blocked.
-------------------------
whitelist
Seems like a good NoScript extension for chrome. However, this extension breaks Netflix so that I had to whitelist ever IP address associated with streaming each individual movie. NoScript on Firefox doesn't have this issue at all. This makes the ScriptSafe unusable since Netflix is where I consume the most media. Unless the author fixes this, I cannot use this extension.
-------------------------

The only problem I have with it is when I watch a streaming service (such as Netflix), their CDN is based on IP addresses, and I continuously have to white list them just to watch a movie.

This is a mediocre copy of NoScript. It breaks Chrome's new tab view. There might be a way to fix it, but the settings interface is so bad, I gave up after trying (and failing) to white list chrome://newtab.

Sometimes I /do/ want ads to run in very specific circumstances.  It is extremely annoying to have ads as part of search results, the ads being relevant to products I'm actually seeking information on, and to then have to copy/paste the URL to another browser without this extension.

ScriptSafe should resolve this by adding the functionality of a second whitelist for sites to allow running scripts on /while visiting that domain only/.
-------------------------
whitelist
this add-on works well in most site. however, for some financial site(banks), it fail to pass through JS code that require by the site. even if you add the site to whitelist. it seems the add-on still blocking something, no matter whats rules you setting.
and perhaps this is most problem of this add-on, it don't show you what it actually blocked.

-----------updated---------
after update to new version, it works perfect!
-------------------------
list
Works really well as a replacement for notscripts and is less work to set up. Two things though. The Asterisk whitelisting doesn't appear to work at all and giving temp permission to a domain on the unwanted list doesn't work/stick. This was important since both id.guardian.co.uk and discussionapi.guardian.co.uk are on the Unwanted list and both seem to be required to use the comments section at the Guardian. More and more domains are winding up in the MVPHosts list that are required to be able to function on the web. Down to 2 stars.

Major issue when using Google search. Scenario, I've pressed the next button and have navigated to page 2, 3 or more of the search results, I then click on a search link to visit a website, but upon pressing the 'back' button I am returned to the first page of my search rather than the actual search page I pressed the link on. If I disable all extensions, the problem goes away, but if I only enable Scriptsafe, the problem returns. If I disable Scriptsafe again, the problem goes away too. All 'resource' sites that Scriptsafe highlighted were given access, plus Google is on my whitelist, but still Google Search has problems. Other issues with Search, but not necessarily related to ScriptSafe, Google Search settings are ignored and never returns to the same point on a page if I have scrolled down from the top. Google Search works way better in Firefox than it does in Chrome, zero problems, even with a ton of add-ons, like NoScript. Slowly feel I'm edging back to Firefox. UPDATE! I've switched back to Firefox as my primary browser. I've always had issues and problems with Chrome, many more than with Firefox. Chrome was all shiny and new with hyped up marketing, but a lot of that gloss has worn off this past year with annoying issues.
-------------------------
list
Allowing trusted sites is too hard and confusing (as others said before), also the synchronization of the white list is broken.

It often doesn't pull a newer version of the settings from the server and then pushes an older one back up. Very broken and reset my white lists several times.

Just unusable this way.

it does work for the most part, but awful when trying to add pages to a temp list or allow blocked for session. making important sites next to impossible to go to. forces me to disable (and then forget i have done so)

I’ve really enjoyed this extension for a year but I’ve now lost all of my settings and whitelists twice in two weeks to the new syncing feature. Restoring or syncing back has not worked. Stay away for now.

I wish there was more non-destructive support from the creator. The name change was also rolled out in an opaque and disruptive manner.
-------------------------
blacklist
After the shambles of the latest release wiping out all settings on several machines, none of them having being synced, it's difficult to have full confidence in ScriptSafe's ability to do its job effectively.

ALL settings were lost, meaning NO protection.  What's worse, this happened over a period when the machines were unmanned, and the update occurred without any notification.  The update was only noticed after visiting a site that successfully accessed items that should've been blocked by the blacklist..

I don't appreciate being forced to beta-test new versions when the existing version worked just fine.  This should've been released as a separate extension to those who wanted that functionality and are prepared to take the associated risks.

Not amused at having to reset the settings...

I've been a loyal user for a long time, but recently I'm having trouble accessing my DD-WRT router configuration site.

It would be great if I did not have to constantly disable it because it does not allow me to whitelist certain domains, such as Last.fm. (It continues to block pages that allow me to actually *listen* to Last.fm.)Why not give people the option to allow specific _pages_ via the pop-up icon?

Great extension -- a long-needed addition to Chrome, security-conscious power users finally have a real equivalent to NoScript for FF.  The only downside is that the NoScript interface is still more intuitive -- ScriptNo doesn't always start by showing you the full list of blocked elements, some seem to show up/disappear sporadically or only after the primary domain is whitelisted.  I'm sure this will get better with time and may be due to API limitations -- keep up the great work!

Probably this extension coupled with one of your other extensions.  It's about as light weight as it comes as far as extensions go.  But it does block pages by default, so if one of your other extensions were to say, rely on loading something from the web and timeout if it can't load it (which means that extension is horrible, because no extension should do this) then this extension would create a delay until you allowed the site it was trying to visit.

It works nice! 
I am using this is very much like NoScript  on firefox. 
However, in the course of webdev over the years there is an increasing amount of use cases where important page elements simply disappear on a website when some site is not enabled. 

I believe this style of webpages are increasing, so what we really need is a shared database with a finer classifications of sites. 
I can imagine a kind of site-voting engine for script block users, so its easy to share the classification of a site and see classification from others.

In the end its about a quick decision to include frontend code from certrain sites, sometimes its needed, sometimes not, sometimes its essential! 

I encountered some bad examples where a checkout flow was missing very important parts.
So if sites which are known to create important content can be tagged, this information can be fed back to the script blocking extentions to support the user in the decision of enabling additional sources.

I see a few different approaches to move forward:
-an integrated evaluation scheme to simplify classification of javascript servers
- maybe even a computation intensive black box approach where the code is executed in a box and the difference to the DOM is evaluated to judge the impact

I think the users of this plugin are a really good user group to discuss  this! :)
-------------------------
javascript
Does not allow blocking of individual scripts within a domain or sub-domain.

The number in parenthesis in front of a domain/sub-domain shows the number of scripts within that domain/sub-domain, and mouse over shows those url's, but those javascripts can not be selected to allow or block.

If I wanted to block a script, I would have to block the entire domain/sub-domain.

Also, if you block a subdomain, on one site, it blocks it globally, add **.adservice.google.com to the blacklist and it's blocked on every site in existence, including google.com.

What should happen is if I block a subdomain that's running scripts on a domain, it should be blocked ONLY on that domain,,

EG, if adservice.google.com is being blocked on say testsite.com, then that subdomain shold ONLY be blocked on testingsite.com ONLY, and not blocked globally across any domain.

Yep, you have to keep marking trust the sites, but after a while you get most of the sites you go to regularly happily whitelisted. Also, you can get the all the information you need from  the majority of niche sites without javascript. It's a small price to pay to keep your computer safe from most browse attack vectors without the need for CPU-sucking av software.

However, you could enable javascript and then block the 3rd party external sites (or subdomains maybe) that the pop ups are coming from.

Can I setup hotkey to "allow all blocked for session", let say "ctrl p"?

I used to this hotkey to temporary allow javascript for one webpage, when I use firefox with noscript
-------------------------

I really love the interface how you can allow/deny specific script domains on a page, however it does not list all of the scripts that get blocked. I assume it's when scripts are loaded dynamically from within other scripts and I can see how this would be difficult to accomplish programatically, but maybe it would be possible to add a button to "find other blocked scripts" which would load and parse the javascript in some sort of background sandbox and figuring out which URLs it is calling but without actually applying the scripts to the page. I have no idea if this could be possible, but it's an idea.

Also the support link above gives a 404.
-------------------------

Good extension. Good interface. Likeable socialize feature. But things are missing:

- The possibility to choose the domain level. 

- All scripts from source (not javascript) that are expressed in sites source.

- Sometime the interface does not unfold.

- The question whether settings are saved on a page basis or general remains open.

Perfect against the current fad of news-pages sliding in an Ad from the right as you're reading. With this addon, they slide their junk into my face one time, and they lose the privilege to run JavaScript on my computer (yes, Ad-makers: the privilege. Running code on my computer is not your right. It is a privilege that, with this addon, I can remove from you again).

Thank you!

One little note: You still name your addon ScriptSafe when you hover over it, and when you ask if you want to add devices for syncing. That was majorly confusing, since I did not know of an addon "ScriptSafe" that I had installed (only "ScriptNo").

This project appears abandoned, no updates in 4 years (since 2017.) I just updated Vivaldi browser to the latest 5.0 version and Hotmail would not open properly until I disabled scriptsafe, which made me check on updates to the extension for current browsers, which are quite different from those only a few months, let alone 4 years old... I'm thinking I need to go back to NoScript, which is updated constantly and works in all browsers now.

Extension does not block content on first load in Chrome/Chromium. After the extension is passed the web content (it pops in on the page then gets blocked afterwards) it will pass it though the ruleset. 

Could be a glitch, but I noticed it the most on weather.com. The extension also needs script specific blocking with heuristics and signatures so I can select which scripts from what domain are loaded.

My previous belief was that this was adequate to block zero-day exploits against webkit and renderer exploits or some other bloatware feature of the browser, but it is not.

Been using this extension for many years, and never experienced lost settings. Granted I don't update my browser every 5 minutes, especially not without backing up some critical extensions just in case. So it seems to be a case of stupid users. We all start somewhere.

It actually works. I tried it with Blank canvas reading it seems to generate random numbers every time. amiunique.org reports every time that I am unique, but it's the only browser fingerprint out of whatever-number-it-is that they collected. So every request that you send is unique but not repeatable.
Overall, very good job, Developer! I used NoScript before, but with Chrome it often doesn't work properly.

I don't use the Internet without it. I won't use the Internet without it. I do not understand how anyone can believe they are safely browsing the Internet without it.

If you thought loading a web page, perhaps your favorite newspaper, for instance, was a simple, two-way communication between your web browser and your newspaper's "server", then please take the time to re-evaluate. Nearly every web page is a sick intersection of tracking, marketing, and content delivery networks - all vectors for compromise - that your browser happily taints you with.

If you like walking naked, with a blind fold, in public, then waste no time learning how to navigate the web with a script blocker. If you care about your Internet hygiene, then look no further. Donate as you can and be grateful that this kind of transparency is possible.

Totally breaks websites that you must log into. After I installed it, I couldn't access my streaming media sites and when I couldn't log into Evernote, I realized it must be the new extension. I disabled it and now my Chrome works again.

But I will say that if you can't use your browser, then it is secure!

It works like security with a shotgun. If you take a shotgun and blow a hole in your computer, then it will be secure as hell. Nothing's more secure than a computer that doesn't work.

Does very well, non-invasive and open source to boot. The only reason I gave four stars is that it doesnt seem to do as well as NoScript but Id rather still run this but unfortunately there is no firefox version and I prefer, when possible to keep my addons consistent across browsers.

Regarding complaints about CPU and a burdensome interface I suppose the later is purely subjective and I do not see this. Regarding cpu usage I have been using this on chrome in 3 different linux distributions, windows 7 in a VM and desktop and Windows 10 on a desktop. I have yet to see any kind of resources issues. It seems to actually be much faster than all other alternatives I have used including NoScript though that is not a fair comparison considering its a different browser.

Great extension. Easy to use and excellent feedback from developer.

However, recent upgrade causes SS to be disabled every time I open browser (Chromium). When I re-enable I get security warning.

What extensions like these need is reputation scoring. If a script is on a list of scripts that belongs to sites that have very high rep because they don't distribute viruses or track their customers then there should be an option to set scripts like that to allowed by default.
Basically if a script is important to a site's functionality and doesn't do anything nasty then you could (completely optionally and anonymously) send of a rating of five stars back to the developer. (but only if they are rated, otherwise it should send nothing)
The ratings would then be compiled into a list with the overall rating of all sites visited and sent off in each update to the extension in everyone browser. Scripts with four or more stars would be allowed by default, scripts with less or no reputation yet would need permission and scripts with two or less would have a warning you need to click through to enable, because they're probably bad.

I've posted this in a few places because I wanted to get the idea out.
I would've made this suggestion on your support site but couldn't find the option to post there.

This extension is a powerful tool for the advanced (power) user. It is not suitable to install on your nontechnical relative's browser.

Once configured, Scriptsafe gives me excellent control over what scripts do and do not run on each page. It's a little shocking to find out how many tracker scripts are trying to run even after using other plugins to disable their tracker images and tracker cookies. 

On the first load of most websites, especially ones with logins, you will need to allow scripts from the main domain of the website, then click the X at the bottom of the scriptsafe box to reload the page, then check out the scriptsafe box to see what new scripts the old previously blocked scripts are trying to load. 

This process is iterative because many websites use scripts to call other scripts. It has to do with the way the web is built, not the way the plugin is built!
-------------------------

Added at least 500ms latency to all page loads. Did not properly show third party content the sites tried to load (from other domains).

NoScript for Firefox is the only reason I still use two browsers. Will continue my search for a NoScript replacement, this didn't make the mark.
-------------------------
browser
ScriptSafe was one of the first extensions to act as a NoScript-like blocker for Chromium based browsers. Unfortunately, it has a few shortcomings in terms of usability that make it less desirable over projects like HTTP Switchboard, plus the lax update schedule is rather worrisome. I wouldn't recommend it over more polished script-blocking alternatives.
-------------------------
browser
I used to use NotScript for the Chrome browser, and after I could no longer find it one day I looked at this extension.

At first some of the reviews made me really reluctant to try this out, but let me tell you this blew NotScript away with how well it has worked! It blows NoScript away as well! This extension gives you SO much more control over exactly what scripts are running on the page.

I would assume that the poor reviews are individuals who should not be using this type of extension in the first place as they obviously do not understand how this sort of thing is supposed to work...

Sometimes I /do/ want ads to run in very specific circumstances.  It is extremely annoying to have ads as part of search results, the ads being relevant to products I'm actually seeking information on, and to then have to copy/paste the URL to another browser without this extension.

ScriptSafe should resolve this by adding the functionality of a second whitelist for sites to allow running scripts on /while visiting that domain only/.
-------------------------

Major issue when using Google search. Scenario, I've pressed the next button and have navigated to page 2, 3 or more of the search results, I then click on a search link to visit a website, but upon pressing the 'back' button I am returned to the first page of my search rather than the actual search page I pressed the link on. If I disable all extensions, the problem goes away, but if I only enable Scriptsafe, the problem returns. If I disable Scriptsafe again, the problem goes away too. All 'resource' sites that Scriptsafe highlighted were given access, plus Google is on my whitelist, but still Google Search has problems. Other issues with Search, but not necessarily related to ScriptSafe, Google Search settings are ignored and never returns to the same point on a page if I have scrolled down from the top. Google Search works way better in Firefox than it does in Chrome, zero problems, even with a ton of add-ons, like NoScript. Slowly feel I'm edging back to Firefox. UPDATE! I've switched back to Firefox as my primary browser. I've always had issues and problems with Chrome, many more than with Firefox. Chrome was all shiny and new with hyped up marketing, but a lot of that gloss has worn off this past year with annoying issues.

Its really not that great. Noscript for firefox is so much better. Sure, this blocks scripts. But good luck actually allowing scripts  for websites you visit and want scripts to run on. Even setting a domain as "trusted" means it only allows that BASE LEVEL domain script to run - you have to manually allow all the other scripts that run on the page still, EVERY single time. And god forbid if a website has hundreds of small, dynamic scripts that run, because you need to allow each and every one manually every time you visit the page. Or you just run with scriptsafe off, which defeats the whole point. Some websites, despite only having a few scripts and allowing them all as "trusted", still don't work unless I disable scriptsafe due to it auto-blocking certain web-bugs with me not able to say "Uh no, actually, I know this website is fine, let me allow it". Meanwhile, noscript for firefox? If you make a website trusted, all scripts that run on that domain run unless you individually block some of them. Setting the website for "Allow" on noscript gets most of the basic scripts running but third party ones (like ads) do not. Setting it so you temporarily want scripts from actually gives that page full temporary scripting access to your browser, instead of needing to manually do it to each and every little script on the website. Why can't scriptsafe do this?

In addition to asking for permission to "display notifications" and "change your privacy-related settings", it's also asking for permission to "read and change all your data on the websites you visit".

-------------------------

Lets not do that unless its a feature disabled by default.  What most seriously security concious people want out of this is more than just blocking potential malicious code. Its also about anonymity on the web. Java and other forms of code can still track you even on precious sites like Youtube, Facebook, Google, and especially sites like Youtube Facebook and Google. Its not a bad feature but it would be pointless for me to spend the last 14 hours wiping out any possible hint of what can be tracked and identified as me even using my desktop only to start chrome and be traced throughout every "uprated" site I go on. You also have the problem of casual users sending erroneous data back and having sites falsely whitelisted. Joe schmoe and his 14 pals all did it to a website they made with a 0day exploit and then paid google to get it around town. Now you've opened up the page and get an applet drive by and your system is compromised by a backdoor shell. Joe has root access (or admin access for windows users) and can see that your journal log windows stores contains 5509-2474-3333-1120 and pin xxxx was used for ebay. catch my drift?

Terribly annoying to use. I prefer NoScript for Firefox. Much more intuitive and user friendly. This extension is very annoying and gui is terrible.

Chrome Crashed, and the Recover feature didn't work because of this. I was in the middle of a bunch of things, and thanks to this program I can't find my place. It may be more efficient to document every site I visit while researching things, but that would be incredibly slow. Now this software is garbage to me. I shouldn't have to whitelist chrome itself, as I obviously trust it enough to run it.

It really needs a global whitelist, you can grab from other sources. Everytime I try it out I have to add things manually, which is rather inefficient, and annoying.

Update: Aside from the complaint below, the author is now pushing out a new update almost every single day. Instead of improving performance, these updates have had the opposite effect. High CPU usage and a slew of new and useless options is now making the extension a liability. I'm not a beta tester, I'm an end user. 

Original review:

Needlessly complex and unreliable. Currently there are 5 different options to that can be selected; Allow, Trust, Deny, Distrust and Temp. Only two are needed; Allow and Allow Permanently.

Often SafeScript simply doesn't work. Despite allowing or trusting a script, this extension continues to block it from running. The only solution is to disable SafeScript completely.

slow
This is the best of the NoScript substitutes for Chrome BUT…

• NO hotkey
• No single-click toggling with the icon
• I have to escape out of the dialog to refresh the  page. I see no reason why it doesn't refresh immediately.

The whole process of using this extension is annoying, tedious, and slow. Click icon. Select option using trackpad--NO keyboard access!  Click in blank area or hit <esc> to refresh.  Usually this has to be repeated at least once since new sites to enable pop up.

I temporarily allow js for most sites, and I usually have to enable js at least once again on most sites, so all of the above just make using this a slow, annoying, tedious, multi-click process.

Needs work…
-------------------------
slow
Thanks, the  cpu usage seems to be related to the Block Click-Through Referrer option (https://github.com/andryou/scriptsafe/issues/38) and will be addressed in the next release. I've already committed the change on Github, but am spending the weekend testing it and other changes out before I release the next version. I am making an active attempt at slowing down the pace, doing more testing, and I feel after this next release ScriptSafe will be more stable along with all the new features built-in over the past week.

Probably this extension coupled with one of your other extensions.  It's about as light weight as it comes as far as extensions go.  But it does block pages by default, so if one of your other extensions were to say, rely on loading something from the web and timeout if it can't load it (which means that extension is horrible, because no extension should do this) then this extension would create a delay until you allowed the site it was trying to visit.
-------------------------
slow
A little counter intuitive to control, which made it a slow start (and a slow shift to GC), but eventually it worked.

Tip to new users:
Note the different GUI representation of scripts  coming from "this site" vs. other sites.
Check them both, when needed...

I'm not too familiar with uBlock Origin unless it's a reasonably basic yet customizable popup blocker... I may have used it before if that's the case.

Are you saying, one should combine https everywhere with "Decentraleyez" and uBlock origin for a package deal that protects you from most threats?

Likely, I would think- anyway, that you get your safety from https everywhere as well as privacy, and then further anonymity and privacy comes from Decentraleyez ... all while uBlock Origin keeps invasive cookies, malicious scripts, popups, advertisements, trackers, and other harmful assets from being able to run? (With uBlock Origin likely disallowing for any non-whitelisted website or asset to obtain access to or potentially execute nefarious code using the client's computer and in turn preventing the server or client computer's access to and thus vulnerability to such nefarious scripts, assets or other nefarious tools as considered to be potentially hostile in nature and as defined by uBlock? Is this a correct understanding? 

The fact that it has origin in its name makes me think that it works by blocking and/or targeting and then disallowing the client computer's access to any websites where specific assets deemed nefarious by uBlock and even more specifically, that it blocks widely used dependencies and libraries often required for other, often nefarious background or other activity that could put the user at risk through unintended execution of nefarious code, invasive or tracking-based advertising, annoying and debilitating popups and/or tracking data; and/or malware-based activities, attacks, or other invasions of privacy.

I love this extension; it’s really a fabulous idea, and I use it all the time! Unfortunately, I noticed that some websites send headers to set CSP preventing the injection of scripts. Is there any way for the extension to detect this issue and (depending on the extension options) revert the URI to allow the script? For example, I’ve seen a website use the “script-src-elem” directive to specify SHA-256 digests of the code.

Great extension, no arguments about effectiveness of the functionality, one thing that would be good, and I admit, only 'would be' it's not a game-changer or anything, but the 'Extension Options' in Chrome, gives a very small popup box, and the list of sites that have been allowed previously, is therefore quite ungainly to work with. I know that most times, just working with the toggle on/off from the button is fine, but I have noticed on very rare occasions, a site might not get removed from the list, so a more visible listing would be nice. As I said, it's not a game-changer or a deal breaker, just an "I wish." Thanks for all your hard work.

Is your extension somehow related to official Firefox' one? I can't see any mentions of it on official site you linked. And link under your name points to same test page. Which is suspicious.

The Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are there to deliver the newest content. If it does not need to do deliver anything new, then why make the request, I only wish I knew if it had its own caching system, local or on the, Time 'Till Live (TTL [when to update the website with newest content]), caching system of CDNs. I erase all cached items every time I close the browser because I do not want old, outdated content that has not reached its TTL; even though it is new, And I do not want this extension doing the same. It is pretty apparent it respects the some sort of, ill-timed TTL, not set by the webmaster; as it breaks some webpages. Therefore I cannot recommend this extension. With uBlock Origin (uBO), it is superfluous as it circumvents the CDN anyway. Lastly who needs to shave 0.01miliseconds off their website loading time? CDNs are only good for saving bandwidth on webhosts that charge by the Megabyte. With uBO, analytics are blocked; and either the CDN or the host acts as it should, serving fresh website data no matter when and how often the webmasters want to update their webpages.
tl;dr,
I just don't see the differenced between locally cached website data and what or why this extension is needed. To break the CDN's TTL and display old website-data? When, how, and why? With uBO, this is not an issue and does not enhance anything, apparently. GIVE US MORE DOCUMENTATION AND AN OPEN SOURCE!

I do like DecentralEyes, for both privacy and speed, but... some websites break with it on. 
For example, the events page at PNWR.org does not expand the quick-view of an event with the extension on.  You can add it to the exclude-list, but here's the thing... you have to figure out that (1) some functionality isn't working, (2) it's on your side (e.g. run in incognito mode or in another browser) and then (3) WHICH extension is causing it.

It's definitely worth it, but the random breakages are annoying.

I don't think it works in Chrome anymore, it doesn't block anything anymore.

I like this extension, I use it on both Firefox and Chrome.
I have recently (as of a few weeks ago) started having an error indicating that HTTPS Everywhere is conflicting with Decentraleyes:

Care to explain what you mean, exactly? How can I do that?

I'm not too familiar with uBlock Origin unless it's a reasonably basic yet customizable popup blocker... I may have used it before if that's the case. However, by the sound of it- the extension, it likely seeks to block the underlying global, often 'shared' advertisement scripts that are very commonly used as the "origins" for then creating such annoying popups and/or advertisement(s) and/or user tracking and/or user targeted advertisements? 

Are you saying, one should combine https everywhere with "Decentraleyez" and uBlock origin for a package deal that protects you from most threats?

Likely, I would think- anyway, that you get your safety from https everywhere as well as privacy, and then further anonymity and privacy comes from Decentraleyez ... all while uBlock Origin keeps invasive cookies, malicious scripts, popups, advertisements, trackers, and other harmful assets from being able to run? (With uBlock Origin likely disallowing for any non-whitelisted website or asset to obtain access to or potentially execute nefarious code using the client's computer and in turn preventing the server or client computer's access to and thus vulnerability to such nefarious scripts, assets or other nefarious tools as considered to be potentially hostile in nature and as defined by uBlock? Is this a correct understanding? 

The fact that it has origin in its name makes me think that it works by blocking and/or targeting and then disallowing the client computer's access to any websites where specific assets deemed nefarious by uBlock and even more specifically, that it blocks widely used dependencies and libraries often required for other, often nefarious background or other activity that could put the user at risk through unintended execution of nefarious code, invasive or tracking-based advertising, annoying and debilitating popups and/or tracking data; and/or malware-based activities, attacks, or other invasions of privacy. 

Is that or am I way off here? How exactly do they work so synergistically together?

Great extension, no arguments about effectiveness of the functionality, one thing that would be good, and I admit, only 'would be' it's not a game-changer or anything, but the 'Extension Options' in Chrome, gives a very small popup box, and the list of sites that have been allowed previously, is therefore quite ungainly to work with. I know that most times, just working with the toggle on/off from the button is fine, but I have noticed on very rare occasions, a site might not get removed from the list, so a more visible listing would be nice. As I said, it's not a game-changer or a deal breaker, just an "I wish." Thanks for all your hard work.

I can install it with no issues, but clicking on the "Test" button demonstrates that some blacklisted CDNs are getting through. Going on multiple websites also shows no cdns blocked.

With regards to the guidelines on configuring HTTPS Everywhere published on your website, when I quit Chrome all the settings in HTTPS Everywhere reset to default.

I love this extension; it’s really a fabulous idea, and I use it all the time! Unfortunately, I noticed that some websites send headers to set CSP preventing the injection of scripts. Is there any way for the extension to detect this issue and (depending on the extension options) revert the URI to allow the script? For example, I’ve seen a website use the “script-src-elem” directive to specify SHA-256 digests of the code.

Not working anymore? Says like extension may be corrupted, same thing if I uninstall it and reinstall it [FYI - I am using Brave Browser, not good with the terminology here, but I believe it's a fork of Chrome - it runs on Chromium I would assume - it uses the Chrome extension webstore [have a similar issue using SAASPASS which is annoying] any help or maybe it needs a patch? Appreciate you & the extension, will check back to see if there are any updates or if you have any idea what's going on [don't know if its just me or everyone across the board] have a great week & happy holidays!

That test page mentions it "Please make sure that Decentraleyes is installed and enabled. Download it for Firefox, or Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Chromium, Chrome)." and the official site does also. Guessing they just didn't have the site updated at first

Thx for a great extension! I was and still am using an Extension called Speed-Up Browsing, which adds missing Cache-Control response headers, enhancing the re-use of already downloaded images/scripts etc. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speed-up-browsing/hkhnldpdljhiooeallkmlajnogjghdfb?hl=en Speed-Up Browsing did improve speed, but not as much as Decentraleyes does. I have them both running atm. My questions: I assume these 2 extensions are compatible as Speed-Up Browsing is simply doing what websites should be doing? Can you suggest any enhancements or settings to get them to work better together? Like perhaps clearing the cache before installing Decentraleyes, or perhaps a specific order in which to install them? Other? I used to enhance Speed-Up Browsing by enabling: Chrome Simple Cache: chrome://flags/#enable-simple-cache-backend https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-stack/disk-cache/very-simple-backend But it seems to have been removed..? Maybe the literature may be of interest to you for your extension/s.

They removed the option to manually check for filter updates! Whenever it failed to block an ad, all I had to do was click check for filter updates, and the ads would immediately go away. But now that option is gone. Youtube now has a wall of ads at the top of their homepage and Adguard hasn't done anthing about it. It takes minutes for sites like Google, which runs Youtube, to figure a way to negate ad blockers, not 6 hours, the most frequest option Adguard has. Give me a break. Why would they remove that option? Plus, they use Github for "support" which is the messiest site on the internet. Use a direct support option instead of making us navigate that awful website.

This adblocker doesn't block the video ads on Twitch. If you believe it is, it is probably because you have prime or have subbed to the streamer's channel. If you want to block the video ads you will need to get a different dedicated adblocker for Twitch. I highly reccomend to read through the extension's privacy policy before using it. I might add that using the adblocks severely lessen a creator's revenue.

It's a great extension that does a satisfactory job of blocking most advertisements and pop-ups that proliferate webpages. My biggest complaint is that there is no way to clear or delete block settings for a webpage. The extension can be disabled for a particular website, but this completely disables any blocking for that website. I need to erase block settings for a particular webpage without disabling the extension itself. There is also a Pause option, but this turns the extension off entirely for all webpages. Neither setting erases block settings. This is incredibly problematic because there are some webpages with additional block settings that interfere with the proper function of the website. I need to be able to reset or erase those settings and revert it to default block settings. There is no option or setting anywhere that allows users to do this. As it is, I have to disable blocking entirely for those webpages because some of the additional block settings have rendered those websites totally unnavigable. This is poorly conceptualised. If I want advertisements to be blocked but some additional blockers have completely messed up the website, I can't do anything about it. I suppose a user could uninstall the entire extension from his computer, but we shouldn't have to clean reinstall the whole program and set new block instructions all over again. Because of this, the extension's primary function is severely flawed.

Works for me at blocking ads that other blockers don't get but the Whitelist option does not work, I use it on youtube because when it is used it blocks the ads but makes the video play and load and auto reload at the same time.

Personally I am a uBlock Origin user, so honestly I can't tell if this is 100% perfect in every situation. But, whenever I have a problem in a site where uBlock Origin makes the site impossible to use, AdGuard has worked 100% of the time!

I use it in specific sites that uBlock Origin seems to either get me blocked from using it, make the site malfunction or even it does not seem to block anything.

I have used AdGuard hundreds of times in such situations and it has without fail always let me browse ad-free those specific sites.
-------------------------

And if an ad isn't being blocked, they have a report system to help get that fixed.

I don't use this on its own for this EXACT reason. When the total rules count exceeds something like 100,000, the extension has a LOT of work to do to find what to block and what to not block. This causes AdGuard to hog up memory in Chrome and slow down the browser. Try to keep the rules count under 50,000 and you're fine. Also, I forgot which filter causes the email trouble, but I think there AdGuard is trying to block phishing links even though the links are fine.

This adblocker doesn't block much on its own. I only use this extension because AdGuard blocks those stupid "UNINSTALL YOUR ADBLOCKER!!!" messages (like in Coolmath games); I only use this extension for the extra functionality Malwarebytes (my actual adblocker) doesn't have.

Does not block Yandex search ads for many months, so you have to add blocking rules manually every time. Support requests on Github are ignored.

Уже в течение многих месяцев Adguard не блокирует рекламу Яндекса в поиске, тогда как другие расширения с этим справляются успешно, приходится самому подбирать и добавлять правила каждый раз, когда выскакивает реклама. Сообщения разработчикам на Github упорно игнорируются.

Liked AdBlocker for years - It was great and did what it was supposed to do.  Quite recently, however, it has taken to blocking me from being able to open links from my email.  I had turned it off for my email page a couple years ago, and that had worked fine, but now it completely disallows clicking the links altogether.  I have to go in to the settings and completely turn off AdBlocker to be able to click the links.  Going to have to remove the extension to even use my email.  Useless extension at this point.

This is a free version of a "paid app" so they block ads on website 99% of the time but still send you ads of their own because....well....because they can I guess...trying to annoy you just enough to get the paid version....uninstalled.

Really helpful! Blocks YouTube ads, social media ads, and others. Never have had an ad pop up unsolicited thus far, would recommend. In the case of websites running on ad profit, it's so easy to pause the blocker and resume activity when finished. 10/10!

It does exactly what it says it will do. It simply block ads.

not exactly. it's not perfect and it doesn't block every ad

not true again. are these same people saying the same thing with different accounts? it doesn't block youtube ads. you need a separate extension.

It was working great at blocking ads but recently on Latest MacOs Moneterey it is causing web page to load super slowly. After disabling this extension, everything works fine with another adblockers.

July/ 2021 - Blocked youtube ads for me, but others seem to disagree.

I disagree...so much I need to use another adblocker in conjunction with adguard. And even then every other video or so shows ads until I refresh the page. I have never seen this extension block any youtube ad, ever.

FINALLY FOUND AN ADBLOCKER THAT CAN "ACTUALLY" BLOCK YOUTUBE ADS!!!
-------------------------

this works like a charm it blocks every ad on any website and even youtube ads.the ownly downside i would have is that if you try downloading something if it tries to take you to another website it will not allow it to. but still a definite 5/5

good but one problem u cant unblock elements sometime so if u block an element by mistake u have to re-download the extension

Would be a fantastic adblocker if it blocked ads on NBC but it doesn't so I only give it a 3 out 5.

I probably have been using this for more than two years, but my opinion on this is extremely high. It blocks ads that I would like it to be blocked, and it also blocks popups that are suspected to be dangerous. I recommend this for anybody who has had enough of ads.

Good job!
This is the only ad-blocker I could find that actually blocks Google Search result spam - that has suddenly become a major annoyance, maybe with the last update of Chrome.

5 start, no less.
Recommend to buy licences to your phone and laptop.
Chromebook is working great with the free extension.
This is the ONLY real ad blocker solution. When all the "ad-blockers" and "skinny browser", ADGuard is actually deliver an actualy shield and protection on your browsers (Chrome and Edge) and to your Windows laptop.
Great job!

I've used this for over a year now, but I have to delete it briefly so I can safe storage space on my chromebook, but incredible, takes a little while to block ads after a restart, but whatever.

If you use AdGuard AdBlocker solely and dont compare or find it demerits, then it is the best. But if you do, then you know it still need polishing and working. I am using AdGuard AdBlocker when it first arrived on store here and havent looked elsewhere but on my other device I have used ublock origin to keep a check on which does the best job. Lacks option to see what ads and trackers are blocked unlike ublock origin does with expand option through extension button itself. Consumes too much battery both via extension and android app and also windows app. If you go to "https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/" and do a check for See how trackers view your browser , you will find ublock origin getting "Our tests indicate that you have strong protection against Web tracking, though your software isn’t checking for Do Not Track policies." but not AdGuard AdBlocker. Weird. Dark theme is missing from extension. The worst is that if it has missed something that should be caught then if you chose to block via AdGuard AdBlocker, it takes ages and with ublock it is instant. If you want to report a page or something (like green color fake download button) that AdGuard AdBlocker to add to their lists in their update, it takes you to a world of forms that never ends. But with ublock it is one click and done. Webrtc doesnt work when enabled to hide. I hope AdGuard AdBlocker will see into this and improve and make it as strong it was before. Their team knows all but still nothing done.

For anyone wondering, or those that have noticed some websites that are getting around ad blocker browser extensions like Twitch (yes even getting ads through U-block Origin). There is the adguard ad blocker browser plugin (this), which is free. But adguard also sells applications for Android, Windows, Mac, and iOS. You can buy the apps as a yearly subscription or pay a one time fee for a lifetime license. What's the difference? The apps block ads SYSTEM WIDE. And because of the way they work can block ad's that browser extensions can't. I finally no longer get any ads or purple screens on Twitch again!

I bought a lifetime family license which covers any 9 devices (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS) at one time. Not just in your browser but system wide. So for example on my Android Galaxy S10+ I see zero ads in any apps, ever. No banner ads, no videos, nothing. In free aps or paid aps. It's a night and day difference.

You can check it out on the adguard website. I managed to snag a lifetime family license for $90. Covers any 9 devices forever (you can of course move those 9 keys around, like when you get a new phone etc).

I had been trying similar ad blocking programs for years without being able to settle on one. I noticed AdGuard AdBlocker by chance actually on GitHub. After investigating this programs reputation and to be sure that it was not created by any company in China, I decided to give it a try and since then I have found no reason to search for another ad blocking program. 

The folks behind AdGuard AdBlocker, apparently never sleep because whenever you press update, even with auto-update turned on, they are churning out new updates. I'm sorry if anyone dislikes my "personal evaluation" and related "personal opinion, regarding the effectiveness of this program for myself. 

Try it..., it's free and they don't nag you like other programs to pay up. AdGuard AdBlocker is great at what it claims to do...period!

i can't get it because my school like every other extension has blocked it :(
-------------------------

It's awesome! But......

It doesn't have the same capabilities of uBlock Origin.
For example, the Filtering Log doesn't show me ALL the page elements that are being blocked, nor all the third party domains that are connected to a website. So I can't fix a website by unblocking some stuff anymore. :(
Also, I cant block elements inside of other elements. Like blocking 1 object from the embedded Disqus plugin. :(

Maybe in the future it'll get better. It also doesn't have a Dark Mode.

[EDIT]:

No, just NO!!! It breaks literally everything!!!! And you don't even know what to unblock, to make it work.........  Uninstalled!!

Best of all tried.  My favored web browser (Flashpeak Slimjet, Windows & Linux) has an inbuilt ad counter & blocker, in the task bar.  My favored test site is Distrowatch.com.  AdGuard AdBlocker was the only Chromium based addon that blocked all five of the advertisements on that web site.

There is nothing like an extension claiming to provide protection from ads etc, behaving like a cheap site trying to bilk people of their money.  I had added this extension, but decided to remove it when it required email address, and accont sign up etc. Next thing I know I receive an email implying I had made a purchase. Addressing this with support, lead to a response from them asking me for my email address and the card used. First of all, how could they not know my email address, when they had sent me a message?  I am currently awaiting confirmation that nothing has been charged and that all info relating to me has been deleted.

Best ad blocker I've downloaded. It blocks alllllll the ads, from youtube to crunchy roll. 11/10

This is so helpful! I used to just deal with ads like anyone else, but then I started getting ads that I actually couldn't exit, and had to close the tab, and that was it. So I got Adguard, and, honestly, didn't think it would work very well. But it blocks every single ad, even ones that I can't even see, apparently. The only downside to using it is everytime you open chrome, the adguard thing opens up in a new tab, and you have to close it. But that really doesn't even matter. The only way this could be made better is, well, not opening in a new tab every time I open google, but also if sites were unable to detect adguard. However, I don't think it is possible to make an undetectable adblocker. 10/10 would DEFINITELY recommend.
-------------------------

Will not block ads, or sites will not let you view without deactivating AdGuard AdBlocker. When going to report an issue, it makes you go through 6 steps, including screenshots AND signing up for an account. No thanks!

ANNOYING VIRUS THING 

Doesnt block many ads, it blocks some, but not all, 

and it is the source of a virus thing where it opens a new tab in bing, or trovi or something, and so you have to click on a link multiple times to get it open. Just dont get it. 

All my friends have this adblocker but and they have the same virus.

WOULD HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND

This is a must-have extension. I use Google Chrome on a Chromebook and some sites are so loaded with ads that it really slowed me down. Once I got Ad Gaurd, it blocked all those annoyances so pages could load faster - and I could get on with my life. Delightfully, it required NO set up. I just installed it and it went to work. Best of all, I still have full control to block or unblock whatever I want, whenever I want.  Great app!

an amazing ad blocker! I really like the stealth mode option if you look into settings. the only issue i have found is that it occasionally blocks popups that you want (ironically) , say if i want to open my word doc from one drive straight to my computer; however, there is probably a way to white-list sites for this.

Look, I understand youtubers need ad revenue. BUT COME ON!? Double ads galore! My old Ipad crashes anytime an ad plays... On my other devices I have noticed that they play right at the most exciting parts of videos, totally killing the flow of whatever I was watching. At some point I stopped seeing them as a necessary evil, and just started physically yelling in annoyance when one came on.

Well. this extension has removed that issue! No longer shall I ever have to bear witness to the double ad! Never again shall my time be used for someone else's monetary gain! (I mean think about it. How much of your life has been used making someone else money?) 

I have read a few of the other reviews here, and it seems like this tool isn't that great at blocking ALL types of ads, but all I needed it for was youtube. And It has blocked ads on that particular site 100% of the time I have had the extension installed. And as long as it can do that, I see no reason to uninstall this time saving extension.

This blocks all of the ads found randomly placed on the internet, which is good. Without these ads, yes, my internet browsing becomes faster. 

But of course, ads which are really stuck there, like that of onlinevideoconverter.com, won't disappear because it is, again, stuck there. However, you can take that down using Adguard's "click-to-block" feature.

Excellent blocker; only way I could be happier would be if it also blocked the chumbox links from showing up at the bottom or sides of the pages; those things get distracting, and are almost never worth looking at.

No clear way to unblock certain parts you manually block. I blocked some parts of twitter I don't want to see but it only made them flash which is even worse. I go into the filtering log and there seems to be no way to reverse it.

I gave this Ad Blocker a try for its simplicity, and while it blocks most ads, it doesn't block a lot of popups. I even tested it against uBlock Origin and found popups that uBlock would block but this adblocker wouldn't. So I'm switching back to uBlock Origin.

It's great at blocking ads most of the time. I have used them for years and will continue to use them. They don't nicely get in the way of other chrome extensions.

If they don't want action item feedback, then say so.

It's a good ad blocker, but it blocks things that are not ads... Like the banner on a website that is purely for design. It also stops me from being able to read comments on the Washington Post unless I turn it off, which then allows ads to show. Unfortunately, there is not a way to customize, at least none that I've found. It's either all or nothing.
-------------------------
block
I initially installed this extension because I was looking for something that could block one specific ad within one specific Facebook game that other ad blockers were missing.  It did take care of that, but it created other problems such as not allowing static resizing of the content on some sites when you resized the window, so I had to keep turning it on and off.  I also wasn't happy about the fact that I had to actually install it on my computer rather than just the browser.  I could have lived with all of that, but there was one big deal-breaker.  It comes up as a free extension and there is absolutely nothing in the description about that being temporary but, after using it for a couple of weeks, it was locked and I was instructed to pay to activate it again.  Knowing that it could resolve the problems I was having because of that one specific ad, I might have been willing to buy it, but the fact that there was no mention of that before I downloaded and installed it is deceptive, and I don't deal with deceptive companies, so I will be completely eradicating it from my computer.
-------------------------

This a decent adblocker for chrome but when its installed far too many websites detect it and ask for your adblocker to be switched off.

I have had to uninstall Adguard because of this problem.

I am now using Ublock origin, Ublock origin extra combined with Nano defender for evading adblock detecting scripts much more reliably and have had no more problems with websites detecting my adblocker.

After waiting five minutes for a newspaper page to load (it was frozen by some annoying background adverts) I decided to install Adguard Adblocker on my Chromebook. The result? The newspaper page loaded in 5 seconds. I don't object to adverts on sites, but when they block the site you are trying to access, Adguard Adblocker comes to the rescue.
-------------------------

I have used this ad blocker for many years now, however, ever since its recent update it has stopped blocking ads. I would rate 5 stars if it still worked, but alas it has finally stopped working properly. Time to move on.

Works on CrunchyRoll, Youtube and regular google. Blocks all ads

Your update getting worse, none of ads blocked by Adguard, I can't even open and update my filters anymore... 

For the developers, just tell me, should I remove this extension?

Worked well until Feb 2019. Now does not block ads at all, and options menu could not be opened.
I use old chrome 49.0.2623.112 m on Windows XP... 
It's a pity, that adguard ceased to work on old machines.
-------------------------

Have used it almost 10 years as a Chrome extension.  Nearly flawless, until yesterday, then all but quit working completely.  Spent a few hours trying to figure out what was wrong to no avail.  Reinstalled, re-booted, tweaked, nothing, unable to access much at all.  Will not even remember blocked page settings.  How on earth could they screw it up so bad!  The new version 3.0.7 is terrible.    Have not found a way to roll it back to previous version.  Hope they get it fixed real soon.
-------------------------

It blocks more ads which is good.Overall great ad blocker. Only wish it could continue blocking ads on certain sites because they get on my last nerve.

Yes it does block ads but in my opinion it may be malicious because when I had it I started having an audio glitch... And my compouter started lagging even more.

Im use this since ~2014. But change in 2019 to AdBlock. Because ext. stop blocking some ads (Yandex.Direct as example).

Удалил. Стал пропускать много рекламы, особенно огромные графические баннеры яндекс.дректа (возможно это связано с тем, что данный блокировщик интегрирован в их браузер, своих не трогают типа). Даже несмотря на запрет в настройках "показывать ненавязчивую рекламу". Какой толк от блокировщика, который плохо блокирует?
-------------------------

I use this extension with Malwarebytes because AdGuard blocks those stupid "UNINSTALL YOUR ADBLOCKER!!!" messages (like in Coolmath games); I only use this extension for the extra functionality Malwarebytes doesn't have.

I'll get a dozen full RED pages saying AD Guard is blocking, but what the hell, what good is AG if I'm getting a full page blocking what ever I viewing.
Plus, I can't get any updates. AG claims to block all ads...which is a lie

I was loving this ad blocker, until recently. It stop blocking all ads on some sites I want no ads. Now, it won't let me turn it off on sites I need it disable (i.e. Hulu). I click to change green check to red x, but when I close menu, it returns to green. Only way to stop is to totally pause protection.

Tammy, I think publishers who serve free content deserve to get some very little income from ads. Expansion of Adblockers usage will end free WEB. You may noticed big publishers like NYT, Washington Post etc. went already into paid subscription based. So all valuable websites who offer premium content for free will end up to block reading until you pay $1/month or so.

Its a bug, just report it to the devs, the program is different then the extension, as it blocks ads before they apear on the website, increasing speed more and reducing bandwith, overall, its better then the extension, it also blocks ads out of websites.

I was happy when I found this extension. It was effective, yet didn't use up too much bandwidth or processor time like most of the others. I have been using it for quite awhile, but suddenly this ad blocker is pushing its own ads? I don't care how good the Black Friday deal is, it's still an ad, which is what this extension is supposed to prevent. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come, because I don't like the idea of looking for a new ad blocker.
-------------------------
block
It says it blocks, however if you search something on google. Instead of result first 4 to 6 links are for advertisement and I'm looking for a blocker which will help children get the actual result rather than misleading ads.

It blocks all ads, but an issue is that it takes significantly longer to load up pages and eats CPU like it's candy.

Works WAAAAAY better than either Adblock Plus or uBlock / uBlock Origin. Origin was bought by the guys who run ABP and is slowly going out of business. I'd rather not support the guys who bought out a once great adblocker. AdGuard, I've been told, actually works... And it does!

So far , from what I've seen, it doesn't allow pop-ups which block you from accessing their website unless you turn it off ( ie Forbes and KnowYourMeme ), and Adblock seems to allow those and has not found a way around disabling those. I hate those pop-ups! I treasure my privacy on the internet and refuse to give it up to greedy corporations who possibly have hundreds of thousands of other non-Adblocking users giving them revenue anyway. I have the right to privacy, and AdGuard definitely allows my privacy to be top priority.

This extension blocks sidebars on Reddit when using the new style-Reddit. If i turn the extension off they come back straight away. So it is definitely this extension.

One star for it making a mistake and blocking something on website that started using a new page style, would seem kinda harsh.  I might bump it down from 5 stars to 4 stars, but rating only 1 star for a total rating because of one miss blocked item, I don't think so.
-------------------------
block
It seems like this "AdGuard" chooses what ads to remove and what ads to keep, ad blockers such as this are paid to not block certain adverts, also when searching on google the first row of ads have increased and make browsing and pain in the backside.
-------------------------
block
Pros:
+Excellent native filters
+Advanced blocking mechanisms

Cons:
-I have been spoiled by uBlock Origin's few-click UI modification of "dynamic filtering" rules. All such rules have to be typed in by hand in AdGuard, which is a bit of a bummer.
-------------------------

Used to work Kinda good on most sites, But must have made some arrangement financially with MSN dot COM (Microsoft) because All adds there are still there even after being blocked. Creators of this add on, must want a bigger paycheck to pay for their second home, W/pool!!

Great extension that works well! 

It blocked a website from trying to use my computer as a Bit Mining platform! I have avast and bitdefender add-ons, neither of them picked up on the attempt to hijack my Chromebook, so both were deleted!

Only downside is i think i clicked the wrong button on the Adguard error message, i then received a strange message from the website, asking for permission to use my pc processing power! Scary stuff!

Either way, pretty surprised, and delighted that Adguard gave me the warning, just please make the warning box easier to understand. It  has 2 options, OK or Cancel, you would think clicking OK would be the right thing to click, but nope, it was cancel lol. Maybe change that to Cancel and Quarantine or something like that, Cancel meaning you want to take the risk, and Quarantine meaning Adguard can do it's thing and block the website and take you back to safety?

But Adguard will be staying on my Chromebook, that's for sure!:)
-------------------------
block
Want maximum security? Switch to Norton. Been using them for years now and they block hijackers like crazy.

If you make a mistake on the "select" portion where you choose where to block the ads it will just turn the screen completely white. I did everything to undo the mistake but was left with a white screen every time. I had no choice but to uninstall.

Will try again and update review with further experience. At the moment, not impressed.

This extension is really not bad it blocks majority of websites the cant detect it. The only website that I found could bypass ads was only twitch.
-------------------------

I love it. My Windows 10 did a big update and it changed my AdGuard settings but it was easy to fix the problem. It had added YouTube to my white list and it was easy to figure it out and go back to blocking YouTube adds because I am boycotting and blocking anything Google uses to make money because they are censoring free speech of innocent people and blocking them from making money.

Blocks only half the ads. the ones that are before the video show up anyways.

This extension failed to block pop ups and drive by downloads. Now that I think of it, I should've used a virtual machine before putting all my trust into this company. I had it coming, but that doesn't stop this sense of deep guttural disappointment... And a couple thousand dollars down the drain.

adblock plus was really not blocking lots of ads recently so i add to delete and try a different blocker or reinstall my chrome then that meant i had to delete everything i have for years in chrome which was not happening so i chose the first option to try a different ad blocker so i came up with this adguard so until now it's brilliant it's blocking those other ads which i wished to be blocked so let's see after a day or two or maybe a week if 'Aretha Smith ' just said its garbage or no! i will come back if its stop working if i didn't come back u guys really are the life savers.

I recently had AdBlock Plus and AdBlocker for Google Chrome. Plus was very buggy, AdBlocker for Chrome was less informative about what it was blocking. Then I installed AdGuard. It TOTALLY FLATTENED AdBlock Plus and AdBlocker for Chrome! It also is a semi-antivirus software, as it can scan my computer as a desktop software. I already have good antivirus on my computer, and the two softwares together formed a faster, safer computer. Also has a cool logo:)
-------------------------
bypass
Only reason i used it was its ability to bypass anti-adblock by itself without any added script. Recently it has failed on that part a lot and i had to disable it to allow ads a lot lately.

It did a good job of blocking ads, but I realized it was preventing me of properly loading videos.

I have tried other Add blocking products and find some annoying others say they are free then out of the blue they tell you "Your free trial has ended". This does none of the above, it just quietly gets on with the job. So I think those that say it has any annoying habits are confusing this (Adguard AdBlocker) with other products.

This extension apparently  was mining bit-coins, without telling me,and the warning said that it would slow my CPU down to a crawl. It might work, but this is just really malicious to be mining bit-coin or something, just to block some ads. DO NOT DOWNLOAD

detect
An outstanding extension. I use Chrome and this is my first choice prior to installation of 'Checker plus for Gmail'. Seriously thinking to buy paid version.
Recommend for giving it a try.
Suggestion to developer: some sites detect it and ask for disabling the 'Blocker'. Is it possible to make it more ...... say stealth so that it can handle the ads etc of such sites within ..... again say a 'Sandbox' by killing these silently instead of user's interaction?

Pros
>Sleek, works super good on hundreds of sites, probably thousands
>I like the little green sheild icon, it's nice graphic design in my opinion
>Blocks about half of the pop-up ads

>Sites can detect it, but it's easy to disable and it remembers which sites you've toggled it off on.

Cons
>Blocks only about half of the pop-up ads
>Sometimes, seemingly, it will block hundreds of ads one at a time until it reaches "infinity", which can make older computers running Chrome slow.

Won't let me use sites like ebates and honey (discount coupons).  I turn off the app for that site but the next time I go back, it blocks it again!  So tried to uninstall Adguard and it keeps saying it is open but I see no way to close it.  Frustrating!  i just want it GONE.

My old ad blocker which I had used for years just wasn't working anymore. So many popups kept coming through. Then ads which where supposed to be blocked also started seeping through. I deleted it and installed Adguard. Now, it is blocking everything again just like my old ad blocker did in the past. All those annoying and sometimes dangerous popups are gone once more. Right now, I would say that Adguard is one of the best ad blockers around for the Chrome browser.
-------------------------

i had a problem with this add a while back as there was a hidden link on a website it wouldnt block or let me manually block without activating add so i posted issue on here, shame as this was the best add blocker i had come across.
Well it would seem that the problem has been sorted and so ive installed it back on my comp.....like i said THE BEST ADD BLOCKER IVE COME ACCROSS
-------------------------
block
This extension has been reliable, until very recently. I've now noticed that Facebook is pushing "Sponsored Posts", slap bang in the middle of my timeline, and this adblocker is not filtering them out. I'd like for them to be blocked as soon as possible as they're *so* numerous (and onerous)

Edit: This app has obviously been updated, as those sponsored posts are now gone. In addition, Adguard blocks the "You are using an adblocker" popup on Allmusic. uBlock wasn't catching that one, but Adguard does. Also, my browsing is definitely faster now
-------------------------

There are a number of websites that are not filtered.  Those sites have found a way around Adguard and attempt to open background websites.

Kills annoying Ads on all sites that I care to NOT see. But, also mind some sites that it may block info you may want, and 'allow' on this site, etc. I noticed on YouTube, when I tried to 'share' a video, not all info was in pop-up to share. So, I allowed Youtube site.

Excellent extension. I was previously using uBlock, and whilst that's also very good, it was just not use friendly and would frequently break pages. I didn't want to stop using it though because the element blocking was so good.

I am so pleased with this. I want to support websites that don't over-do their ads. This lets me easily disable for sites and when they misuse my trust I block them again. This gives the user the power and eventually will force ad makers to reconsider their aggressive methods. Now I desperately need you guys on my chrome browser on my android phone. lol My desktop with 12RAM can handle ads but loading websites with the 3RAM on my nexus 6p can be just a nightmare. I have been forced to abandon information I wanted cos the websites are just THAT bad with ads. And me regretting giving them the hit cos they sure as hell don't deserve it.

This does block adds, however it seems to inject certain popup adds that began only after installing  Adguard AdBlocker.
This is regardless of settings.
Removed  this  extion and tried Add Block Plus and never  seen those adds or any other again .
Turned off Add Block Plus and tried Adguard again, well what you know?
That same popup adds back again.
Personal experience I would not use Adguard and switch to Add Block Plus  or something else.

Lord, please, anything but AdBlock Plus. I'm upset by AdBlock's recent switch to promoting ads, where all I want it to do is remove them. I know, they have to make money somehow, but promoting and getting paid to run ads when your program is expressly made to block said ads bothers me. If I find out Adguard does the same, I guess I'll just have to uninstall it as well and brave the never-ending stream of bright trash unguarded.

Fake fake fake. This is the " Free " blocker. The one that blocks all ad's is a paid one.

Perfect for my use, the element blocker is perfect for removing stuff that aren't tehcnically ads, but still annoying bullshit that shouldn't be there, top notch extension :) All it's missing is the ability to block sponsored content on facebook.

i love this app

use in conjunction with AdBlock Plus, Ghostery, Keyboard Privacy and nothing gets through.

Go into the advanced filter settings and enable the feature to suppress anti-adblock notifications. Some sites detect users using these applications, the setting stops their detection.

If you like a site, and rely on it for news /sports /information of any kind, support the page and whitelist it :)

blocks dynamic adds (which adblock & adblock plus doesn't)

Block element isnt working anymore, thats sucks...
Im using now Fair AdBlock App (by STANDS) just because you can disable any element you want with it...
-------------------------
block
The 'block element on page' feature isn't working on chrome. Also the adguard integration mode with my mac full version is spotty. Sometimes its recognized and sometimes not.

block
Blocking everything to the point that you can't even view videos anymore, and the only way to view the video would often be disabling Adguard and reload the page... which defeats the purpose of this extension...
-------------------------
block
The only ad blocker I have found which offers blacklisting, as well as whitelising. (Although they call it "invert whitelisting" just to obfuscate.)

I don't like ads, but almost all the great sites I use are funded by ads. I only want to block ads at the nasty sites I am reluctantly forced to use now and again.
-------------------------

Very efficient! Too much efficient!

Links opened in new tab are blocked, same thing for links opened in new window...

What a shame!

one from many extension, which is right blocking all type of adv

Adguard needs to fix it's feature to self block ads because it's not working anymore and that was a great feature it had. Waiting for an update to restore it comes back  :c. Other than that it's nice.

do as what it says.. blocked 90% of the ads. nice!

Switched from another ad block extensions after it began to fail in blocking ads. This one works perfectly and feels a lot less bloated!

Used a # of adblockers, in different browsers for a while, and I've been luckily to avoid malware-as-adblocker. And if you use multiple browsers, it gets marginally more complicated. They work well enough, being more or less powerful (and annoying.)

Adguard is one adblocker to rule them all. :-) 

It is working smoothly for months on latest Mac OS X on an last gen iMac. 

Adguard simplifies setting up monitoring an adblock. Opt to protect local OS and/or browsers and/or mobile OS in added value versions.

I've only had Adguard AdBlocker for a couple of months. Didn't notice any problems until today. Opened www.motortrend.com site using Chrome to look at a slideshow of cars. Pix would NOT show; just got "turning gear" thingy. Tried incognito window. Pix displayed. Went back to default window with all extensions disabled. Pix displayed. Started enabling extensions one at a time and discovered the problem: Adguard prevents the pix from displaying. Added www.motortrend.com to white list, closed and reopened Chrome. Pix still blocked. May have to try a different blocker.

It recently became detectable in some websites it was not detectable earlier.

Doesn't block ads from all sites anymore.
-------------------------

Works great but I wish it had a drop down list of blocked sites for each page that you could enable/disable, like in Ghostery. The problem is that if a feature doesn't work on a page, you can't disable the block, you have to whitelist the entire site.
-------------------------
block
it has blocked facebook, and I don't want that
-------------------------
block
Best ad blocker you can get and its free. Nothing else will ever work this well. Adguard got down blocking ads very well. I would recommend adding this to your chrome browser ASAP.
-------------------------
block
Works very well, however for the past few days, I wasn't able to use any facebook dropdown features like in a group, i cannot press dropdown then delete a post. I must disable it in order to use it. Also, youtube, it sometimes turn the video into a blackscreen and have to wait like 2 seconds till the video is normal. Im guessing your blocking too many things??
-------------------------

This app is the best it has blocked EVERY single ad I've even tried going to websites that I know have ads ALL the time and I didn't even see one

best Ad-Blocker for chrome me using since about 3 months, but a bug noticed, eventually stopped working and changed the icon, then i realized, I could not find the reason either its due to I scanned my computer with SpyHunter and that may detected Adguard as spying extension and did something with it or that was its own bug. Anyhow i reinstalled it again. Its perfect working application
-------------------------
block
Overall it works perfectly in blocking ads.  
I think it's whitelisting system can be improved because I cannot whitelist specific Youtube channels.  I have to manually pause adguard and then turn it back on.  I find AdBlock better because of this.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block ads on Youtube so I am getting rid of it
-------------------------
block
Had to disable it and use Adblock Plus, instead, because Adguard blocks me from comments on marketwatch.com.
-------------------------
detect
thats probably because its a virus sending keystrokes into your system that are hidden an your antivirus' cant detect them.
-------------------------
block
Freaking useless for Facebook. It only blocks ads for maybe 30 seconds then there they are again.
-------------------------
block
if there was a way to get rid of the number of adds blocked by the extision off that would be super , the website shows the option to not show it but it dosent work . its kinda like sweepin dirt under the rug eventualy someones goin to see all that dirt . its like after acouple of weeks it just stops and you gotta reinstall it again , and it dosent block popups or pop up unders , as far as i have seen nothing does . if it did all of that and stayed free i'de give it 5 stars . i would start telling as many people as i could if it did all of that , but thanks for trying .

Finally I found extension that works properly and blocks everything that I need (annoying pop ups and new browser windows that open without permissions).

Actually, that must only be in chrome. Firefox has no issues with any of the adblockers being detected by youtube.....

I've noticed recently that effectiveness and functionality seems to have diminished. I am having increased ads / popups on websites I visit which has greatly diminished browsing functionality. I'm sure that the developers are playing a game of whack-a-mole trying to prevent new technologies from circumventing their ad blocking extension. Hopefully we will see an update soon that will improve ad blocking effectiveness.

does not block pop-unders AT ALL! waste of time

Actually blocks ads :D

So far I keep coming back to this app. Once I removed, I couldn't believe how many ads popped back up. It's worked great. The only thing I wish for is a little more heads up when it breaks a page. Occasionally I'd like to remove specific blocking that is preventing a page from working, and seems to be an on or off selection

Had a bunch of pop ups from various sights saying i had a virus. I panicked, thinking it was true and that Chrome wasn't protected against viruses like it advertises.

-------------------------
block
This is, by far, THE BEST ad blocker I've ever used in Chrome. All the others I've used have done their jobs decently, but this one takes it to the next level. With former ad blockers that I've used in the past, there would still be one or two that get missed consistently; and reporting them didn't really get anywhere either. But with Adguard blocker, I've not seen a single ad anywhere. And my favorite feature is the counter so you can see just how crazy this works. For instance, it's showing 16 blocked adds right here in the Google Chrome store! Stop looking and just get this one!
-------------------------
block
The problem is that it was not blocking the ads. I would click block ads and yet the same ad would continue to pop up.
-------------------------
block
This tool does nothing more than insert a huge block of CSS inside the "Head" of the website which attempts to guess the CSS class name of potential ads on the page. 

This is a rudimentary approach that can easily be circumvented by advertisers coming up with a class name not covered by the inserted CSS. This will lead to updates that will steadily increase the size of the inserted CSS.

If the developer could find a way of ensuring that this CSS is inserted at the beginning of the website's "Head" then it would at least avoid causing the site to slow down, however as it is inserted at the end it causes the site to load all other CSS files synchronously rather than asynchonously.

If you're a web developer I would seriously avoid this extension.
-------------------------
block
Works great for blocking ads and pop ups while its running, but seems to crash a lot on my computer (brand new chromebook) One minute it will be working and the next it wont show up on my tool bar and suddenly I have popup and ads and the classic goggle "hes dead Jim" message...not sure if this is a problem related to adgaurd or something up with my chromebook, the only way to get back to smooth running seems to be to powerwash and reload my adblocker for it to stay up and work.

The other adblock extensions, while it does block ads, uses a lot of memory, thus your computer slows down. Thankfully, adguard actually makes your computer run faster without using a ton of memory. I also found the anti malware/spyware option to be very helpful.

Does the trick.  Blocks adds and my machine seems to be running faster on a very limited network.
-------------------------

i think the problem is Adguard tries to be too automated without the need for user intervention and because of that does not offers a way of cultivating a users defined blacklist that one can maintain in addition to what adguard can block on its own. Having used this for 2 months now and i still needed to install Adblock Plus in along side to deal with popunders that adguard doesnt catch like redirects and because adguard has no userlist or website blacklist that can be edited by the user it is the one thing that is sorely missing from what would be a perfect extension. would also be great if you could report a site that adguard isnt blocking, so those that control what gets blocked can take another look. but adguard doesn't do any of that sadly. i do like the fact they included a nice element blocker which i have never tried but all things considered it is nearly a complete solution.
-------------------------

kinda like it... but once it lose fighting some ad-agent. The adware remove and disable it and prevent it to being added again to chrome... haha... funny huh?!

A very useful tool but needs to b made more friendly in usage for example the process of blocking adds on a page should b made more easy.one should know instantly the add one blocked has been blocked,this result should come as pop up message.while live streaming u block adds but they either dnt get blocked or if they get blocked somehow live streaming is also blocked.so therefore as a user selects n blocks an aad he/she should be prompted of result of particular aad name with confirmation that it has been blocked,,bottom line make it user friendly.In future users will rate on average very useful.

It blocks ads, thats for sure, but it also blocks a lot more. If you use Google Shopping like I do, then you will notice the Names of the stores are being blocks.

"Block ad on this website" doesn't seem to do anything. And it doesn't block Google ads by default. Poor.

Some websites seem immune to the "Block ad on this website" menu option.  And whitelist is currently empty, so it can't be that.

I have mixed feelings about this one. They advertise it as a fast and lightweight alternative to ABP, but in my experience it's neither faster nor more conservative with resources.

Compared to ABP (which I had installed until a few days ago) it makes the whole browser hang while loading pages I frequent. That's not optimal, even though it does pretty darn well when it comes to blocking ads.

Suffice to say I'm switching back to ABP until this is resolved.
-------------------------
block
very lightweight compared to adblock and adblock plus. A small bug: Even though i unchecked number of blocked adds indication in settings, it still shows in extension icon.
-------------------------

Blessed to get this mighty app to block stupid ads!
-------------------------

wish i could block flash ads...
-------------------------

I must say this is truly fast and lightweight than ABP, I just opened a couple of websites that have lots of ads and it blocked it with default settings, and it consumed less memory than ABP for about 50%.. AWESOME.. hope to see more of your updates
-------------------------
block
Blocks nicely, but sometimes it blocks too much.
-------------------------
block
Comparative to the open source ad blockers, AdGuard is highly-customizable with all-inclusive features that are needed to kick-off unwanted advertisements and banners.
Good thing about this app is it blocks all threats like phishing, malware and viruses.
A really professional software with more weight-age on Ad Block Plus!
-------------------------
block
Of all the privacy enhancers and ad blockers, this one...
... offers the simplest, most efficient interface
... affects browsing speed the least
... offers the options of blocking specific ads, images etc. on a webpage in the simple manner
-------------------------
block
I don't know what people are saying, maybe they are paid reviewers, but this app is NOT better than adblock. Adguard blatantly leaves ads up all over the net on sites like ebay. It's terrible. And then you can't manually block an ad like you can with adblock.

2 stars for the prettiness and clean interface. Function is 0 stars
-------------------------
block
I hate to leave a negative review, but:

The performance isn't  much better than AdBlock, with AdGuard enabled a test page loaded in 2.5s and when I disabled it the page loaded in 1.7s. 0.8s is a lot of time to be added to every page load.

I also don't like the upselling on the AdGuard Web Filter or the tracking, malware and phishing "blocking".

On the plus side, it has a great interface and is quite a bit simpler than AdBlock.
-------------------------
block
I feel like I have more control with adguard than with adblock plus. Adguard allows me to disable on specific webpages in case it accidentally blocks something that it's not supposed to.
-------------------------

popup
It's a great extension that does a satisfactory job of blocking most advertisements and pop-ups that proliferate webpages. My biggest complaint is that there is no way to clear or delete block settings for a webpage. The extension can be disabled for a particular website, but this completely disables any blocking for that website. I need to erase block settings for a particular webpage without disabling the extension itself. There is also a Pause option, but this turns the extension off entirely for all webpages. Neither setting erases block settings. This is incredibly problematic because there are some webpages with additional block settings that interfere with the proper function of the website. I need to be able to reset or erase those settings and revert it to default block settings. There is no option or setting anywhere that allows users to do this. As it is, I have to disable blocking entirely for those webpages because some of the additional block settings have rendered those websites totally unnavigable. This is poorly conceptualised. If I want advertisements to be blocked but some additional blockers have completely messed up the website, I can't do anything about it. I suppose a user could uninstall the entire extension from his computer, but we shouldn't have to clean reinstall the whole program and set new block instructions all over again. Because of this, the extension's primary function is severely flawed.

an amazing ad blocker! I really like the stealth mode option if you look into settings. the only issue i have found is that it occasionally blocks popups that you want (ironically) , say if i want to open my word doc from one drive straight to my computer; however, there is probably a way to white-list sites for this.

Using AdGuard and uBlock Origin keeps 98.9% of unwanted ads when I'm looking at streaming video sites, many of which are filled with intrusive popups and browser hijacks. Unfortunately, the 1.1% that got through were some of the worst of the lot!
The app's not perfect but it does its job. Do NOT look at non-secure sites without it!

too many pop-ups trying to get me to buy the full version. iT DIDN'T even block the basic ads so why would I buy the full version?

Works WAAAAAY better than either Adblock Plus or uBlock / uBlock Origin. Origin was bought by the guys who run ABP and is slowly going out of business. I'd rather not support the guys who bought out a once great adblocker. AdGuard, I've been told, actually works... And it does!

So far , from what I've seen, it doesn't allow pop-ups which block you from accessing their website unless you turn it off ( ie Forbes and KnowYourMeme ), and Adblock seems to allow those and has not found a way around disabling those. I hate those pop-ups! I treasure my privacy on the internet and refuse to give it up to greedy corporations who possibly have hundreds of thousands of other non-Adblocking users giving them revenue anyway. I have the right to privacy, and AdGuard definitely allows my privacy to be top priority.

Pros
>Sleek, works super good on hundreds of sites, probably thousands
>I like the little green sheild icon, it's nice graphic design in my opinion
>Blocks about half of the pop-up ads
>The only adblock I would reccomend. I put it on my mother's computer.
>Sites can detect it, but it's easy to disable and it remembers which sites you've toggled it off on.

Cons
>Blocks only about half of the pop-up ads
>Sometimes, seemingly, it will block hundreds of ads one at a time until it reaches "infinity", which can make older computers running Chrome slow.

My old ad blocker which I had used for years just wasn't working anymore. So many popups kept coming through. Then ads which where supposed to be blocked also started seeping through. I deleted it and installed Adguard. Now, it is blocking everything again just like my old ad blocker did in the past. All those annoying and sometimes dangerous popups are gone once more. Right now, I would say that Adguard is one of the best ad blockers around for the Chrome browser.

This extension has been reliable, until very recently. I've now noticed that Facebook is pushing "Sponsored Posts", slap bang in the middle of my timeline, and this adblocker is not filtering them out. I'd like for them to be blocked as soon as possible as they're *so* numerous (and onerous)

Edit: This app has obviously been updated, as those sponsored posts are now gone. In addition, Adguard blocks the "You are using an adblocker" popup on Allmusic. uBlock wasn't catching that one, but Adguard does. Also, my browsing is definitely faster now
-------------------------

Kills annoying Ads on all sites that I care to NOT see. But, also mind some sites that it may block info you may want, and 'allow' on this site, etc. I noticed on YouTube, when I tried to 'share' a video, not all info was in pop-up to share. So, I allowed Youtube site.

I have been using Adguard Adblocker for a long time now and it Blocks not only Taboola & Outbrain but some others that aren't even listed that used to pop-up... YES on the MSN browser?

This does block adds, however it seems to inject certain popup adds that began only after installing  Adguard AdBlocker.
This is regardless of settings.
Removed  this  extion and tried Add Block Plus and never  seen those adds or any other again .
Turned off Add Block Plus and tried Adguard again, well what you know?
That same popup adds back again.
Personal experience I would not use Adguard and switch to Add Block Plus  or something else.

not very bad, but bad i am getting a lot of hidden popups it's annoying me very much,unable to get rid of those hidden popups by this guard..

if there was a way to get rid of the number of adds blocked by the extision off that would be super , the website shows the option to not show it but it dosent work . its kinda like sweepin dirt under the rug eventualy someones goin to see all that dirt . its like after acouple of weeks it just stops and you gotta reinstall it again , and it dosent block popups or pop up unders , as far as i have seen nothing does . if it did all of that and stayed free i'de give it 5 stars . i would start telling as many people as i could if it did all of that , but thanks for trying .

I've noticed recently that effectiveness and functionality seems to have diminished. I am having increased ads / popups on websites I visit which has greatly diminished browsing functionality. I'm sure that the developers are playing a game of whack-a-mole trying to prevent new technologies from circumventing their ad blocking extension. Hopefully we will see an update soon that will improve ad blocking effectiveness.

Works great for blocking ads and pop ups while its running, but seems to crash a lot on my computer (brand new chromebook) One minute it will be working and the next it wont show up on my tool bar and suddenly I have popup and ads and the classic goggle "hes dead Jim" message...not sure if this is a problem related to adgaurd or something up with my chromebook, the only way to get back to smooth running seems to be to powerwash and reload my adblocker for it to stay up and work.

I did not intentionally add this software onto my laptop. It is a pain and is always throwing stuff out on my screen. I cant seem to delete it, which is never a good thing; very invasive and too much popups: always having to delete ads off of my screen.

So far so good. But please fix the issue with blocking popups initiated by other Chrome extensions, i.e. Buffer App. Cheers!

They removed the option to manually check for filter updates! Whenever it failed to block an ad, all I had to do was click check for filter updates, and the ads would immediately go away. But now that option is gone. Youtube now has a wall of ads at the top of their homepage and Adguard hasn't done anthing about it. It takes minutes for sites like Google, which runs Youtube, to figure a way to negate ad blockers, not 6 hours, the most frequest option Adguard has. Give me a break. Why would they remove that option? Plus, they use Github for "support" which is the messiest site on the internet. Use a direct support option instead of making us navigate that awful website.

Works for me at blocking ads that other blockers don't get but the Whitelist option does not work, I use it on youtube because when it is used it blocks the ads but makes the video play and load and auto reload at the same time.

I had this for 2 years and now it stopped blocking ads I loved this but now I'm moving on to find a new one this one does not work corectly

I thought it was working great. I didn't see ads while I'm using it. I didn't do anything with it (like create rules) except occasionally pause it on the odd website. I didn't think to connect it to some browser issues; email links not opening, letters in petitions not opening to view, clicks in a page not resulting in action (like pull down menus, for example), and incredibly slow site loading. 

Several months ago I noticed that when I was in an online store, the pages were reacting incredibly slowly to clicks within it. It might up to 60 seconds for a pull down menu to appear, and it hardly ever stayed open. The problem spread to other sites until, recently, even gmail wasn't reacting when I tried to delete emails or open them. I'd have to find workarounds, like using MS Edge, instead.

Today I went through my extensions and turned them all off, and then activated them one by one while clicking on an email link I wanted to open. The only time the link wouldn't open was when I activated Adguard Adblocker. Now that I've disabled it, I have no trouble opening email links in Chrome. The letters in petitions that wouldn't open, now open.

For months I've been going through Chrome settings, even looking in the settings of Adguard Adblocker, to try and find out why clicking email links would only result in a brief flash of a new tab before closing again. I couldn't find any reason for this. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Adguard Adblocker but that didn't change anything. Even now that I know Adguard Adblocker is the cause, I still can't find anything in its settings that would explain the browser issues. It's just that I used to be able to open email links but one day that all changed.

Now that I've disabled Adguard Adblocker, Chrome is loading pages at a normal speed, email links open, webpages are operational, email functionality is back; everything works as it should.

Well, it's disabled now. Maybe the producer can tell me what to do to get it working properly again.
Thanks.

It's awesome! But......

It doesn't have the same capabilities of uBlock Origin.
For example, the Filtering Log doesn't show me ALL the page elements that are being blocked, nor all the third party domains that are connected to a website. So I can't fix a website by unblocking some stuff anymore. :(
Also, I cant block elements inside of other elements. Like blocking 1 object from the embedded Disqus plugin. :(

Maybe in the future it'll get better. It also doesn't have a Dark Mode.

[EDIT]:

No, just NO!!! It breaks literally everything!!!! And you don't even know what to unblock, to make it work.........  Uninstalled!!

This is a must-have extension. I use Google Chrome on a Chromebook and some sites are so loaded with ads that it really slowed me down.

Best of all, I still have full control to block or unblock whatever I want, whenever I want.  Great app!

I was so happy when I found AdGuard 4 years ago. I tried several other adblockers, but none of those were so efficient. And in case there's something that bugs me (e.g. a subscribe banner or a floating thingy on the bottom of the screen) just a few clicks and it's gone!

No more google ads, I can enjoy the FB and YT videos without interruption, so for me, AdGuard is the best!

Look, I understand youtubers need ad revenue. BUT COME ON!? Double ads galore! My old Ipad crashes anytime an ad plays... On my other devices I have noticed that they play right at the most exciting parts of videos, totally killing the flow of whatever I was watching. At some point I stopped seeing them as a necessary evil, and just started physically yelling in annoyance when one came on.

Well. this extension has removed that issue! No longer shall I ever have to bear witness to the double ad! Never again shall my time be used for someone else's monetary gain! (I mean think about it. How much of your life has been used making someone else money?) 

I have read a few of the other reviews here, and it seems like this tool isn't that great at blocking ALL types of ads, but all I needed it for was youtube. And It has blocked ads on that particular site 100% of the time I have had the extension installed. And as long as it can do that, I see no reason to uninstall this time saving extension.

Works WAAAAAY better than either Adblock Plus or uBlock / uBlock Origin. Origin was bought by the guys who run ABP and is slowly going out of business. I'd rather not support the guys who bought out a once great adblocker. AdGuard, I've been told, actually works... And it does!

So far , from what I've seen, it doesn't allow pop-ups which block you from accessing their website unless you turn it off ( ie Forbes and KnowYourMeme ), and Adblock seems to allow those and has not found a way around disabling those. I hate those pop-ups! I treasure my privacy on the internet and refuse to give it up to greedy corporations who possibly have hundreds of thousands of other non-Adblocking users giving them revenue anyway. I have the right to privacy, and AdGuard definitely allows my privacy to be top priority.

Great extension that works well! 

It blocked a website from trying to use my computer as a Bit Mining platform! I have avast and bitdefender add-ons, neither of them picked up on the attempt to hijack my Chromebook, so both were deleted!

Only downside is i think i clicked the wrong button on the Adguard error message, i then received a strange message from the website, asking for permission to use my pc processing power! Scary stuff!

Either way, pretty surprised, and delighted that Adguard gave me the warning, just please make the warning box easier to understand. It  has 2 options, OK or Cancel, you would think clicking OK would be the right thing to click, but nope, it was cancel lol. Maybe change that to Cancel and Quarantine or something like that, Cancel meaning you want to take the risk, and Quarantine meaning Adguard can do it's thing and block the website and take you back to safety?

But Adguard will be staying on my Chromebook, that's for sure!:)
-------------------------
stop
Probably better to change them entirely, in that case -- if you leave a Cancel button, those of us who know that "OK" means "okay to proceed" and "Cancel" means to cancel navigating to that site (as it's been for a very long time) would be confused by the change in behavior. Perhaps I might suggest "Continue" and "Stop."

This extension failed to block pop ups and drive by downloads. Now that I think of it, I should've used a virtual machine before putting all my trust into this company. I had it coming, but that doesn't stop this sense of deep guttural disappointment... And a couple thousand dollars down the drain.

While this ad blocker did get rid of ads (I was especially annoyed with seeing the same click bait-y ones on sites I visit daily), it reduced the speed of my Chromebook to the early days of dial up.

The app just crashed my browser, so I'm done with it. I actually removed it and then had to reinstall it just to rate it, but once I review it, it's gone again. I can't deal with the hanging.

Excellent extension. I was previously using uBlock, and whilst that's also very good, it was just not use friendly and would frequently break pages. I didn't want to stop using it though because the element blocking was so good.

I am so pleased with this. I want to support websites that don't over-do their ads. This lets me easily disable for sites and when they misuse my trust I block them again.

I have been forced to abandon information I wanted cos the websites are just THAT bad with ads. And me regretting giving them the hit cos they sure as hell don't deserve it.

For the last couple months, my websites have been loading very slow and images have been flickering and moving around the screen (especially on Amazon). I thought I had a virus or malware or something. Kept running my anti-virus and a couple different malware removal tools with no luck fixing it. Decided to check my extensions and saw that everyone else is having the same problem. Please fix so I don't have to go back to ABP
-------------------------
bug
LIKED it. Until the adblock even causes bug to leave the whole video area blank..not even the control buttons would show up..
-------------------------
stop
Causes web pages that have multiple images to flicker on and off multiple times as the page loads. Very annoying.
Especially annoying on amazon when you search for a product and you get the search results with images next to each one.
Disabled the extension and flickering stopped. Maybe it will get fixed soon so I haven't uninstalled it yet. Will keep trying it once in a while and see what the progress is.
-------------------------

Seems to do an excellent job of blocking ads, but images flicker on and off multiple times as pages load. Very annoying. Disabling Adguard fixed the flickering problem. This was happening in both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 16.04.
-------------------------
load
Since the latest update, some websites are behaving strangely. Amazon is a prime example - the content seems to "flicker" a half dozen times after loading.
-------------------------
stop
Websites work on blocking ad blocker and making ads go around it sadly. They get money for doing ads, and adblocker stops them for us. I honestly don't care if they lose money, I don't want to see disrespectful, rude, inappropriate, lowlife ads. 
-------------------------
stop
But it is not allowed on diep.io because it stops the whole game could you fix that please.it does not work with the game either when you pause it
-------------------------
stop
Also blocks Taboola and Outbrain, which ABP stopped doing.
-------------------------
stop
This is amazing - when it works...

It seems to work fine for a few days, maybe a week or so, and then it just stops working (the icon is greyed out, not green, and of course ads are there).

The problems is I can't just click or reload it again, I have to manually delete the app and re-install it from the Chrome web store and then individually re-load every single one of like, 30-40 tabs.

This is a complete pain and I never ever had this problem with Adblock or Adblock Plus, hence the 2 star rating.

I really want to like this app as I think it's the best when it's working, but it's just too unstable for me.
-------------------------
load
I causes Chrome to load slower that Firefox & Opera.
-------------------------
stop
i love this app

use in conjunction with AdBlock Plus, Ghostery, Keyboard Privacy and nothing gets through.

Go into the advanced filter settings and enable the feature to suppress anti-adblock notifications. Some sites detect users using these applications, the setting stops their detection.

At first (year ago) was good, and now it makes many websites stop working, closing popups who is not ads and so on.

access
Many of the sites I go to ignore the adguard.  Adguard worked very well until I decided to do the trial for the premium service and it has expired.  Now, it seems the adguard does not exist for any of the sites anymore at any level.  I cannot even do job searches as ads pop up and refuse to allow me access to my screen inputting devices.

after installing this i ended up with virus...-_- and after deleting it stopped

Not 5 stars until it stops Facebook from showing ads in the middle of the newsfeed again...

bug
best Ad-Blocker for chrome me using since about 3 months, but a bug noticed, eventually stopped working and changed the icon, then i realized, I could not find the reason either its due to I scanned my computer with SpyHunter and that may detected Adguard as spying extension and did something with it or that was its own bug. Anyhow i reinstalled it again. Its perfect working application

break
So far I keep coming back to this app. Once I removed, I couldn't believe how many ads popped back up. It's worked great. The only thing I wish for is a little more heads up when it breaks a page. Occasionally I'd like to remove specific blocking that is preventing a page from working, and seems to be an on or off selection

This is, by far, THE BEST ad blocker I've ever used in Chrome. All the others I've used have done their jobs decently, but this one takes it to the next level. With former ad blockers that I've used in the past, there would still be one or two that get missed consistently; and reporting them didn't really get anywhere either. But with Adguard blocker, I've not seen a single ad anywhere. And my favorite feature is the counter so you can see just how crazy this works. For instance, it's showing 16 blocked adds right here in the Google Chrome store! Stop looking and just get this one!
-------------------------
stop
I've almost been going crazy with popups in chrome on my mac. Poper Blocker worked for some but Adguard seemed to have finally stopped them altogether - thank you!
-------------------------
load
This tool does nothing more than insert a huge block of CSS inside the "Head" of the website which attempts to guess the CSS class name of potential ads on the page. 

This is a rudimentary approach that can easily be circumvented by advertisers coming up with a class name not covered by the inserted CSS. This will lead to updates that will steadily increase the size of the inserted CSS.

If the developer could find a way of ensuring that this CSS is inserted at the beginning of the website's "Head" then it would at least avoid causing the site to slow down, however as it is inserted at the end it causes the site to load all other CSS files synchronously rather than asynchonously.

If you're a web developer I would seriously avoid this extension.
-------------------------
reload
Works great for blocking ads and pop ups while its running, but seems to crash a lot on my computer (brand new chromebook) One minute it will be working and the next it wont show up on my tool bar and suddenly I have popup and ads and the classic goggle "hes dead Jim" message...not sure if this is a problem related to adgaurd or something up with my chromebook, the only way to get back to smooth running seems to be to powerwash and reload my adblocker for it to stay up and work.

Are you serious?!!!!
Have JUST, two seconds ago, installed Adguard Adblocker and IMMEDIATELY received an Ad from Facebook asking if I want to work from home. I'm speechless.
Now it's letting the ad pages load THEN telling me  it's blocked them. I need it to PREVENT them loading in the first place. Arrrghhh!!!!

It's a great app, although I've noticed a problem, possibly caused by this app. It seems that either this extension or 'Hola!' cause a web URL to need to be entered two or three times before it can be loaded... A glitch of some kind causes this slight slow-down to happen so that whenever I try going to a new website, nothing happens the first (and maybe second) time, and my recently visited websites page loads instead. Any suggestions to fix this would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

It used to work really good but after the Chrome update the program doesn't reboot when I turn it on. It stops working if I turn my computer off. So I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to make it work again, and it's REALLY annoying/irritating.

Also it slows the loading of videos intensely. If they even load at all.

Was perfect at first, then stopped working after about a week, Now when you click on it it does nothing, and right click>options just opens a new tab and asks like it's loading....Uninstall and re-install did not fix it

I have mixed feelings about this one. They advertise it as a fast and lightweight alternative to ABP, but in my experience it's neither faster nor more conservative with resources.

Compared to ABP (which I had installed until a few days ago) it makes the whole browser hang while loading pages I frequent. That's not optimal, even though it does pretty darn well when it comes to blocking ads.

Suffice to say I'm switching back to ABP until this is resolved.
-------------------------
bug
very lightweight compared to adblock and adblock plus. A small bug: Even though i unchecked number of blocked adds indication in settings, it still shows in extension icon.
-------------------------
access
I was using this extension for several months with my work Outlook Web Access. This week it began inserting lots of extras into the source code of emails sent through OWA when using chrome that caused other servers to reject my email as spam. I identified this by disabling all extensions and enabling one by one. This was the culprit - be warned. I will be sending information to developer.
-------------------------

I hate to leave a negative review, but:

The performance isn't  much better than AdBlock, with AdGuard enabled a test page loaded in 2.5s and when I disabled it the page loaded in 1.7s. 0.8s is a lot of time to be added to every page load.

I also don't like the upselling on the AdGuard Web Filter or the tracking, malware and phishing "blocking".

On the plus side, it has a great interface and is quite a bit simpler than AdBlock.
-------------------------
--------------------------------------------------
tracking - 2
third
It's awesome! But......

It doesn't have the same capabilities of uBlock Origin.
For example, the Filtering Log doesn't show me ALL the page elements that are being blocked, nor all the third party domains that are connected to a website. So I can't fix a website by unblocking some stuff anymore. :(
Also, I cant block elements inside of other elements. Like blocking 1 object from the embedded Disqus plugin. :(

Maybe in the future it'll get better. It also doesn't have a Dark Mode.

[EDIT]:

No, just NO!!! It breaks literally everything!!!! And you don't even know what to unblock, to make it work.........  Uninstalled!!

I loaded up SpeedTest.net and got horrible results, refreshed the page to try again and got more horrible results.  Upon loading the third time I noticed that five different ads were all trying to load at the same time.  With AdGuard AdBlocker; no ads = no false results.  Thanks AdGuard!

They removed the option to manually check for filter updates! Whenever it failed to block an ad, all I had to do was click check for filter updates, and the ads would immediately go away. But now that option is gone. Youtube now has a wall of ads at the top of their homepage and Adguard hasn't done anthing about it. It takes minutes for sites like Google, which runs Youtube, to figure a way to negate ad blockers, not 6 hours, the most frequest option Adguard has. Give me a break. Why would they remove that option? Plus, they use Github for "support" which is the messiest site on the internet. Use a direct support option instead of making us navigate that awful website.

It's a great extension that does a satisfactory job of blocking most advertisements and pop-ups that proliferate webpages. My biggest complaint is that there is no way to clear or delete block settings for a webpage. The extension can be disabled for a particular website, but this completely disables any blocking for that website. I need to erase block settings for a particular webpage without disabling the extension itself. There is also a Pause option, but this turns the extension off entirely for all webpages. Neither setting erases block settings. This is incredibly problematic because there are some webpages with additional block settings that interfere with the proper function of the website. I need to be able to reset or erase those settings and revert it to default block settings. There is no option or setting anywhere that allows users to do this. As it is, I have to disable blocking entirely for those webpages because some of the additional block settings have rendered those websites totally unnavigable. This is poorly conceptualised. If I want advertisements to be blocked but some additional blockers have completely messed up the website, I can't do anything about it. I suppose a user could uninstall the entire extension from his computer, but we shouldn't have to clean reinstall the whole program and set new block instructions all over again. Because of this, the extension's primary function is severely flawed.
-------------------------

Works for me at blocking ads that other blockers don't get but the Whitelist option does not work, I use it on youtube because when it is used it blocks the ads but makes the video play and load and auto reload at the same time.  

You need to turn off this adblocker if you want the video to load normally.

I thought it was working great. I didn't see ads while I'm using it. I didn't do anything with it (like create rules) except occasionally pause it on the odd website. I didn't think to connect it to some browser issues; email links not opening, letters in petitions not opening to view, clicks in a page not resulting in action (like pull down menus, for example), and incredibly slow site loading. 

Several months ago I noticed that when I was in an online store, the pages were reacting incredibly slowly to clicks within it. It might up to 60 seconds for a pull down menu to appear, and it hardly ever stayed open. The problem spread to other sites until, recently, even gmail wasn't reacting when I tried to delete emails or open them. I'd have to find workarounds, like using MS Edge, instead.

Today I went through my extensions and turned them all off, and then activated them one by one while clicking on an email link I wanted to open. The only time the link wouldn't open was when I activated Adguard Adblocker. Now that I've disabled it, I have no trouble opening email links in Chrome. The letters in petitions that wouldn't open, now open.

For months I've been going through Chrome settings, even looking in the settings of Adguard Adblocker, to try and find out why clicking email links would only result in a brief flash of a new tab before closing again. I couldn't find any reason for this. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Adguard Adblocker but that didn't change anything. Even now that I know Adguard Adblocker is the cause, I still can't find anything in its settings that would explain the browser issues. It's just that I used to be able to open email links but one day that all changed.

Now that I've disabled Adguard Adblocker, Chrome is loading pages at a normal speed, email links open, webpages are operational, email functionality is back; everything works as it should.

Well, it's disabled now. Maybe the producer can tell me what to do to get it working properly again.
Thanks.

The mobile version, as used by Chromebook, doesn't show 'reset' filtering log when dropping down the menu on toolbar icon. The desktop version has this option. So consequently I have to open the filtering log, then refresh the page and try to find the addition(s) I added for blocking which can be very time consuming with long filter list. I realize this is only when there's been a manual add of block(s), but nevertheless still inconvenient.. Why is this??

Liked AdBlocker for years - It was great and did what it was supposed to do.  Quite recently, however, it has taken to blocking me from being able to open links from my email.  I had turned it off for my email page a couple years ago, and that had worked fine, but now it completely disallows clicking the links altogether.  I have to go in to the settings and completely turn off AdBlocker to be able to click the links.  Going to have to remove the extension to even use my email.  Useless extension at this point.

It's a good ad blocker, but it blocks things that are not ads... Like the banner on a website that is purely for design.

I initially installed this extension because I was looking for something that could block one specific ad within one specific Facebook game that other ad blockers were missing.  It did take care of that, but it created other problems such as not allowing static resizing of the content on some sites when you resized the window, so I had to keep turning it on and off.  I also wasn't happy about the fact that I had to actually install it on my computer rather than just the browser.  I could have lived with all of that, but there was one big deal-breaker.  It comes up as a free extension and there is absolutely nothing in the description about that being temporary but, after using it for a couple of weeks, it was locked and I was instructed to pay to activate it again.  Knowing that it could resolve the problems I was having because of that one specific ad, I might have been willing to buy it, but the fact that there was no mention of that before I downloaded and installed it is deceptive, and I don't deal with deceptive companies, so I will be completely eradicating it from my computer.

This a decent adblocker for chrome but when its installed far too many websites detect it and ask for your adblocker to be switched off.

Works WAAAAAY better than either Adblock Plus or uBlock / uBlock Origin. Origin was bought by the guys who run ABP and is slowly going out of business. I'd rather not support the guys who bought out a once great adblocker. AdGuard, I've been told, actually works... And it does!

So far , from what I've seen, it doesn't allow pop-ups which block you from accessing their website unless you turn it off ( ie Forbes and KnowYourMeme ), and Adblock seems to allow those and has not found a way around disabling those. I hate those pop-ups! I treasure my privacy on the internet and refuse to give it up to greedy corporations who possibly have hundreds of thousands of other non-Adblocking users giving them revenue anyway. I have the right to privacy, and AdGuard definitely allows my privacy to be top priority.

>Sleek, works super good on hundreds of sites, probably thousands
>I like the little green sheild icon, it's nice graphic design in my opinion
>Blocks about half of the pop-up ads

>Sites can detect it, but it's easy to disable and it remembers which sites you've toggled it off on.

Cons
>Blocks only about half of the pop-up ads
>Sometimes, seemingly, it will block hundreds of ads one at a time until it reaches "infinity", which can make older computers running Chrome slow.

This does block adds, however it seems to inject certain popup adds that began only after installing  Adguard AdBlocker.
This is regardless of settings.
Removed  this  extion and tried Add Block Plus and never  seen those adds or any other again .
Turned off Add Block Plus and tried Adguard again, well what you know?
That same popup adds back again.
Personal experience I would not use Adguard and switch to Add Block Plus  or something else.

Causes web pages that have multiple images to flicker on and off multiple times as the page loads. Very annoying.
Especially annoying on amazon when you search for a product and you get the search results with images next to each one.
Disabled the extension and flickering stopped. Maybe it will get fixed soon so I haven't uninstalled it yet. Will keep trying it once in a while and see what the progress is.

This has been happening on amazon for a LOOONG time. Still a problem. The biggest problem though is that turning off protection on Amazon doesn't fix it. You have to disable the extension completely.

This is amazing - when it works...

It seems to work fine for a few days, maybe a week or so, and then it just stops working (the icon is greyed out, not green, and of course ads are there).

The problems is I can't just click or reload it again, I have to manually delete the app and re-install it from the Chrome web store and then individually re-load every single one of like, 30-40 tabs.

This is a complete pain and I never ever had this problem with Adblock or Adblock Plus, hence the 2 star rating.

I really want to like this app as I think it's the best when it's working, but it's just too unstable for me.

if there was a way to get rid of the number of adds blocked by the extision off that would be super , the website shows the option to not show it but it dosent work . its kinda like sweepin dirt under the rug eventualy someones goin to see all that dirt . its like after acouple of weeks it just stops and you gotta reinstall it again , and it dosent block popups or pop up unders , as far as i have seen nothing does . if it did all of that and stayed free i'de give it 5 stars . i would start telling as many people as i could if it did all of that , but thanks for trying .

So far I keep coming back to this app. Once I removed, I couldn't believe how many ads popped back up. It's worked great. The only thing I wish for is a little more heads up when it breaks a page. Occasionally I'd like to remove specific blocking that is preventing a page from working, and seems to be an on or off selection

I don't know what people are saying, maybe they are paid reviewers, but this app is NOT better than adblock. Adguard blatantly leaves ads up all over the net on sites like ebay. It's terrible. And then you can't manually block an ad like you can with adblock.

2 stars for the prettiness and clean interface. Function is 0 stars

They removed the option to manually check for filter updates! Whenever it failed to block an ad, all I had to do was click check for filter updates, and the ads would immediately go away. But now that option is gone. Youtube now has a wall of ads at the top of their homepage and Adguard hasn't done anthing about it. It takes minutes for sites like Google, which runs Youtube, to figure a way to negate ad blockers, not 6 hours, the most frequest option Adguard has. Give me a break. Why would they remove that option? Plus, they use Github for "support" which is the messiest site on the internet. Use a direct support option instead of making us navigate that awful website.

Works for me at blocking ads that other blockers don't get but the Whitelist option does not work, I use it on youtube because when it is used it blocks the ads but makes the video play and load and auto reload at the same time.  

You need to turn off this adblocker if you want the video to load normally.

Misses lots of ads on Russian and Ukrainian websites like gismeteo. Doesn't block Yandex Direct ads. Occasionally causes double scrollbars and makes scrolling with a mouse wheel impossible - for example, when you Google search "Euro 2020" and open list of matches (provided by Google), or on website "docs.microsoft.com". Blocks images of products on store websites (for example, eva.ua).

I don't use this on its own for this EXACT reason. When the total rules count exceeds something like 100,000, the extension has a LOT of work to do to find what to block and what to not block. This causes AdGuard to hog up memory in Chrome and slow down the browser. Try to keep the rules count under 50,000 and you're fine. Also, I forgot which filter causes the email trouble, but I think there AdGuard is trying to block phishing links even though the links are fine.

The mobile version, as used by Chromebook, doesn't show 'reset' filtering log when dropping down the menu on toolbar icon. The desktop version has this option. So consequently I have to open the filtering log, then refresh the page and try to find the addition(s) I added for blocking which can be very time consuming with long filter list. I realize this is only when there's been a manual add of block(s), but nevertheless still inconvenient.. Why is this??

Blocks more ads than other ad blockers but it lags my high end system bad.  I only have the basic filter enabled so I couldn't imagine how bad it would be with several enabled.

It's pretty darn good, but so is U-block Origin. However, lately both of these are really starting to slow down my browsing experience. I have a pretty fast system but when enabled (and most features enabled too) I really notice a lot of lag when opening up webpages.

I bet most people aren't aware of all the settings as the GUI isn't very intuitive. And that should be changed because even though I have used Adguard for a few years now, I sometimes forget to enable all the settings I need and saving the settings to file isn't 100% reliable (another issue with this extension). 

I suggest the makers of Adguard look at U-block origin and their settings.It's much more simpler and straight-forward to manage in regards to the filters.

If you use AdGuard AdBlocker solely and dont compare or find it demerits, then it is the best. But if you do, then you know it still need polishing and working. I am using AdGuard AdBlocker when it first arrived on store here and havent looked elsewhere but on my other device I have used ublock origin to keep a check on which does the best job. Lacks option to see what ads and trackers are blocked unlike ublock origin does with expand option through extension button itself. Consumes too much battery both via extension and android app and also windows app. If you go to "https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/" and do a check for See how trackers view your browser , you will find ublock origin getting "Our tests indicate that you have strong protection against Web tracking, though your software isn’t checking for Do Not Track policies." but not AdGuard AdBlocker. Weird. Dark theme is missing from extension. The worst is that if it has missed something that should be caught then if you chose to block via AdGuard AdBlocker, it takes ages and with ublock it is instant. If you want to report a page or something (like green color fake download button) that AdGuard AdBlocker to add to their lists in their update, it takes you to a world of forms that never ends. But with ublock it is one click and done. Webrtc doesnt work when enabled to hide. I hope AdGuard AdBlocker will see into this and improve and make it as strong it was before. Their team knows all but still nothing done.
-------------------------
filter
It's awesome! But......

It doesn't have the same capabilities of uBlock Origin.
For example, the Filtering Log doesn't show me ALL the page elements that are being blocked, nor all the third party domains that are connected to a website. So I can't fix a website by unblocking some stuff anymore. :(
Also, I cant block elements inside of other elements. Like blocking 1 object from the embedded Disqus plugin. :(

Maybe in the future it'll get better. It also doesn't have a Dark Mode.

[EDIT]:

No, just NO!!! It breaks literally everything!!!! And you don't even know what to unblock, to make it work.........  Uninstalled!!

I recently began having "breakthrough" ads appear, however that problem was solved after I updated my filters, and learned a bit about making my own filters....which is quite a useful tutorial provided by the Adguard developers. I thank the developers for supplying that particular educational tool! I think 
that if people just exerted the same amount of energy they use to complain about particular services (such as Adguard) into learning from the educational programs provided by those services (free of charge, mind you) they would have much, much less to complain about! I mean honestly, have humans really devolved to the point that they have become so incredibly lazy that they literally will refuse to lift a finger on their own behalf, even when the tools to correct the problem are provided for FREE?? What a sad, sad commentary regarding modern Humanity! I give FIVE STARS to Adguard for both its application as well as their tutorials which they make available to users for FREE!!!

What a heaping pile of cow dung.  This reminds me of when people were encouraged to smoke, and thought hiding under their school desk would save them from a nuc shockwave.  aaaaaai am baffled by the number claimed, and suspect the favorable views were gotten illegitimately because nobody serious about web work can tolerate the mass of trash this filter allows, even when it is tweaked.  In fact, I could write an app in the time it took me to set-up this app and all its pseudo features.  Do yourself a favor and find another REAL blocker that starts with U and one G and the Y all three are what you need along with a site blocker to blacklist in one simple click any offensive annoying add.  Now that the option to kill video and music is not permitted at least some people have common sense.  Who would buy anything from a business that rudely interupts your work?  An idiot.

I dunno, sounds to me like it's working fine. You probably just need to update your filters and/or your browser. 
Also, instead of instantly assuming that your minor issue is such a problem that downrating the entire app would help anyone, why not post your issue into the support section to see if it may be something very easily remedied? That way, you can stick with what could still be the "best ad-blocker" and you just don't know how to use it, without all the hassle of having to search the net to "find another one". But, more importantly, if it did turn out to be a larger issue, if it were posted on the support tab it will inform the developers, which would help them fix it sooner so that it affects the least amount of users overall. 
Leaving a review like this and changing your rating doesn't help anyone. 
All in all, what I took from your updated review was, that you thought this was such a great Ad-Blocker, yet were so easily able to jump ship that you have zero loyalty to the tools you use and enjoy the most, get to use and enjoy for free and are rather ignorant when it comes to what should be done when you experience a slightly different behavior with your ad-blocking extension than what you're normally used too, and that you're too lazy to figure it out for yourself or care enough to help anyone else that may be in the same boat. You know, this review might be helpful to someone... Probably not. But hey, thanks for taking the time to update it. Good looking out. ;)

Go to Adguard's options and add the URLs of the sites it's giving you problems on to the whitelist.  Problem solved.  If you really just want the extension gone,  just right-click on it and select "Remove from Chrome".  You might also try killing ALL tasks - apps AND processes - containing the words chrome, Google, Adblocker, extension, etc. and then running an uninstall.   

If the above doesn't work, I would force-uninstall it using a third-party system maintenance app or uninstaller utility.  These apps are much more powerful than the uninstall function built into your OS or the ones that often come with software you install.  Generally, third-party uninstallers can completely, permanently, and safely remove any stubborn app from your system (even if the app doesn't show up on your OS's uninstall function).  Thee app usually also remove registry keys, file fragments, and other remnants and clutter from the app normally left behind.  I usually recommend Your Uninstaller or one by IObit; these have great search functions that will find your app, wherever it's hiding in your system, and target it for destruction!

There are many other excellent (and free) uninstallers out there that would also do the job (check out http://download.cnet.com/utilities-uninstallers/windows/).  Hope this help!

This extension has been reliable, until very recently. I've now noticed that Facebook is pushing "Sponsored Posts", slap bang in the middle of my timeline, and this adblocker is not filtering them out. I'd like for them to be blocked as soon as possible as they're *so* numerous (and onerous)

Edit: This app has obviously been updated, as those sponsored posts are now gone. In addition, Adguard blocks the "You are using an adblocker" popup on Allmusic. uBlock wasn't catching that one, but Adguard does. Also, my browsing is definitely faster now

blacklist
i think the problem is Adguard tries to be too automated without the need for user intervention and because of that does not offers a way of cultivating a users defined blacklist that one can maintain in addition to what adguard can block on its own. Having used this for 2 months now and i still needed to install Adblock Plus in along side to deal with popunders that adguard doesnt catch like redirects and because adguard has no userlist or website blacklist that can be edited by the user it is the one thing that is sorely missing from what would be a perfect extension. would also be great if you could report a site that adguard isnt blocking, so those that control what gets blocked can take another look. but adguard doesn't do any of that sadly. i do like the fact they included a nice element blocker which i have never tried but all things considered it is nearly a complete solution.

Some websites seem immune to the "Block ad on this website" menu option.  And whitelist is currently empty, so it can't be that.

I hate to leave a negative review, but:

The performance isn't  much better than AdBlock, with AdGuard enabled a test page loaded in 2.5s and when I disabled it the page loaded in 1.7s. 0.8s is a lot of time to be added to every page load.

I also don't like the upselling on the AdGuard Web Filter or the tracking, malware and phishing "blocking".

On the plus side, it has a great interface and is quite a bit simpler than AdBlock.

It's a great extension that does a satisfactory job of blocking most advertisements and pop-ups that proliferate webpages. My biggest complaint is that there is no way to clear or delete block settings for a webpage. The extension can be disabled for a particular website, but this completely disables any blocking for that website. I need to erase block settings for a particular webpage without disabling the extension itself. There is also a Pause option, but this turns the extension off entirely for all webpages. Neither setting erases block settings. This is incredibly problematic because there are some webpages with additional block settings that interfere with the proper function of the website. I need to be able to reset or erase those settings and revert it to default block settings. There is no option or setting anywhere that allows users to do this. As it is, I have to disable blocking entirely for those webpages because some of the additional block settings have rendered those websites totally unnavigable. This is poorly conceptualised. If I want advertisements to be blocked but some additional blockers have completely messed up the website, I can't do anything about it. I suppose a user could uninstall the entire extension from his computer, but we shouldn't have to clean reinstall the whole program and set new block instructions all over again. Because of this, the extension's primary function is severely flawed.

It's turned off by default and can't find a way to change that. I have tried contacting support through twitter and after more than a month I have not received any response.

It should work. The settings are a PIA and not intuitive and the default settings may not be effective for your browsing

I DEFINETLY do not recommend this!

Most people say this is a good blocker because they don't know that after a couple of months It actually adds a virus to your computer that will ultimately change your default search engine, Find your ip address, track your favorite web searches and etc.
I experienced it myself several times you can search up "yahoo(or Bing) redirect virus" and find that somewhere it will say ad guard is one of the reasons and when you get rid of the extension that's when it will disappear.
Most people after getting the redirect virus don't know how to fix it so they search it up and find a way to get rid of it after uninstalling and reinstalling it so they just rush to do that. However, viruses are usually not the web browsers fault it is usually a website or an extension that causes search engine and other viruses.

I've only had Adguard AdBlocker for a couple of months. Didn't notice any problems until today. Opened www.motortrend.com site using Chrome to look at a slideshow of cars. Pix would NOT show; just got "turning gear" thingy. Tried incognito window. Pix displayed. Went back to default window with all extensions disabled. Pix displayed. Started enabling extensions one at a time and discovered the problem: Adguard prevents the pix from displaying. Added www.motortrend.com to white list, closed and reopened Chrome. Pix still blocked. May have to try a different blocker.

"Block ad on this website" doesn't seem to do anything. And it doesn't block Google ads by default. Poor.

I must say this is truly fast and lightweight than ABP, I just opened a couple of websites that have lots of ads and it blocked it with default settings, and it consumed less memory than ABP for about 50%.. AWESOME.. hope to see more of your updates

If you use AdGuard AdBlocker solely and dont compare or find it demerits, then it is the best. But if you do, then you know it still need polishing and working. I am using AdGuard AdBlocker when it first arrived on store here and havent looked elsewhere but on my other device I have used ublock origin to keep a check on which does the best job. Lacks option to see what ads and trackers are blocked unlike ublock origin does with expand option through extension button itself. Consumes too much battery both via extension and android app and also windows app. If you go to "https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/" and do a check for See how trackers view your browser , you will find ublock origin getting "Our tests indicate that you have strong protection against Web tracking, though your software isn’t checking for Do Not Track policies." but not AdGuard AdBlocker. Weird. Dark theme is missing from extension. The worst is that if it has missed something that should be caught then if you chose to block via AdGuard AdBlocker, it takes ages and with ublock it is instant. If you want to report a page or something (like green color fake download button) that AdGuard AdBlocker to add to their lists in their update, it takes you to a world of forms that never ends. But with ublock it is one click and done. Webrtc doesnt work when enabled to hide. I hope AdGuard AdBlocker will see into this and improve and make it as strong it was before. Their team knows all but still nothing done.

I thought it was working great. I didn't see ads while I'm using it. I didn't do anything with it (like create rules) except occasionally pause it on the odd website. I didn't think to connect it to some browser issues; email links not opening, letters in petitions not opening to view, clicks in a page not resulting in action (like pull down menus, for example), and incredibly slow site loading. 

Several months ago I noticed that when I was in an online store, the pages were reacting incredibly slowly to clicks within it. It might up to 60 seconds for a pull down menu to appear, and it hardly ever stayed open. The problem spread to other sites until, recently, even gmail wasn't reacting when I tried to delete emails or open them. I'd have to find workarounds, like using MS Edge, instead.

Today I went through my extensions and turned them all off, and then activated them one by one while clicking on an email link I wanted to open. The only time the link wouldn't open was when I activated Adguard Adblocker. Now that I've disabled it, I have no trouble opening email links in Chrome. The letters in petitions that wouldn't open, now open.

For months I've been going through Chrome settings, even looking in the settings of Adguard Adblocker, to try and find out why clicking email links would only result in a brief flash of a new tab before closing again. I couldn't find any reason for this. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Adguard Adblocker but that didn't change anything. Even now that I know Adguard Adblocker is the cause, I still can't find anything in its settings that would explain the browser issues. It's just that I used to be able to open email links but one day that all changed.

Now that I've disabled Adguard Adblocker, Chrome is loading pages at a normal speed, email links open, webpages are operational, email functionality is back; everything works as it should.

Well, it's disabled now. Maybe the producer can tell me what to do to get it working properly again.
Thanks.

I don't use this on its own for this EXACT reason. When the total rules count exceeds something like 100,000, the extension has a LOT of work to do to find what to block and what to not block. This causes AdGuard to hog up memory in Chrome and slow down the browser. Try to keep the rules count under 50,000 and you're fine. Also, I forgot which filter causes the email trouble, but I think there AdGuard is trying to block phishing links even though the links are fine.

I have used Adguard for a few years now.  It is the only ad-blocking extension that I add to my browsers right now.

Tried at least 6 different ad blockers, kiwis native one and bromite but without their webview. Tried host files, Android 11 s20, I was just installing extension by extension and tried each, some did disable some ads they didn't others, some disabled ads then when I restered browser ads showed up again. Not sure why when I switched to desktop mode all ads magically disappeared even I used only host file. Anyways this extension  worked I don't see any single ad on kiwi mobile version.

5 start, no less.
Recommend to buy licences to your phone and laptop.
Chromebook is working great with the free extension.
This is the ONLY real ad blocker solution. When all the "ad-blockers" and "skinny browser", ADGuard is actually deliver an actualy shield and protection on your browsers (Chrome and Edge) and to your Windows laptop.
Great job!

For anyone wondering, or those that have noticed some websites that are getting around ad blocker browser extensions like Twitch (yes even getting ads through U-block Origin). There is the adguard ad blocker browser plugin (this), which is free. But adguard also sells applications for Android, Windows, Mac, and iOS. You can buy the apps as a yearly subscription or pay a one time fee for a lifetime license. What's the difference? The apps block ads SYSTEM WIDE. And because of the way they work can block ad's that browser extensions can't. I finally no longer get any ads or purple screens on Twitch again!

I bought a lifetime family license which covers any 9 devices (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS) at one time. Not just in your browser but system wide. So for example on my Android Galaxy S10+ I see zero ads in any apps, ever. No banner ads, no videos, nothing. In free aps or paid aps. It's a night and day difference.

You can check it out on the adguard website. I managed to snag a lifetime family license for $90. Covers any 9 devices forever (you can of course move those 9 keys around, like when you get a new phone etc).

Best of all tried.  My favored web browser (Flashpeak Slimjet, Windows & Linux) has an inbuilt ad counter & blocker, in the task bar.  My favored test site is Distrowatch.com.  AdGuard AdBlocker was the only Chromium based addon that blocked all five of the advertisements on that web site.

It used to be alright, but now it is for some odd reason slowing down all of my web browsers. I have this installed = Slow video loading, page loading etc.

I initially installed this extension because I was looking for something that could block one specific ad within one specific Facebook game that other ad blockers were missing.  It did take care of that, but it created other problems such as not allowing static resizing of the content on some sites when you resized the window, so I had to keep turning it on and off.  I also wasn't happy about the fact that I had to actually install it on my computer rather than just the browser.  I could have lived with all of that, but there was one big deal-breaker.  It comes up as a free extension and there is absolutely nothing in the description about that being temporary but, after using it for a couple of weeks, it was locked and I was instructed to pay to activate it again.  Knowing that it could resolve the problems I was having because of that one specific ad, I might have been willing to buy it, but the fact that there was no mention of that before I downloaded and installed it is deceptive, and I don't deal with deceptive companies, so I will be completely eradicating it from my computer.

I used AdGuard as chrome extension and it was great so I decided to purchase a lifetime license and downloaded the standalone software for Mac.

Using AdGuard and uBlock Origin keeps 98.9% of unwanted ads when I'm looking at streaming video sites, many of which are filled with intrusive popups and browser hijacks. Unfortunately, the 1.1% that got through were some of the worst of the lot!
The app's not perfect but it does its job. Do NOT look at non-secure sites without it!

OUTSTANDINGLY EXCELLENT - facebook ?  all ads gone - zap !

This extension is free. You're thinking of "Adguard for Windows" and "Adguard for Mac". Those are system tools, not conventional browser extensions, and you do have to pay for those after a free trial. But there's no free trial for this extension, it's free forever.
-------------------------
browser
You can disable it on any website, on Chrome in the upper right hand side on your tool bar there is a little green shield icon.  Click on it and there's a button to disable AdBlocker.  I'm not sure if it's permanent or temporary.  At least that's how it looks on my browser.  And I think it comes up if you left click on the site if you use a mouse, or do a 2 finger tap on your touch pad.

I dunno, sounds to me like it's working fine. You probably just need to update your filters and/or your browser. 
Also, instead of instantly assuming that your minor issue is such a problem that downrating the entire app would help anyone, why not post your issue into the support section to see if it may be something very easily remedied? That way, you can stick with what could still be the "best ad-blocker" and you just don't know how to use it, without all the hassle of having to search the net to "find another one". But, more importantly, if it did turn out to be a larger issue, if it were posted on the support tab it will inform the developers, which would help them fix it sooner so that it affects the least amount of users overall. 
Leaving a review like this and changing your rating doesn't help anyone. 
All in all, what I took from your updated review was, that you thought this was such a great Ad-Blocker, yet were so easily able to jump ship that you have zero loyalty to the tools you use and enjoy the most, get to use and enjoy for free and are rather ignorant when it comes to what should be done when you experience a slightly different behavior with your ad-blocking extension than what you're normally used too, and that you're too lazy to figure it out for yourself or care enough to help anyone else that may be in the same boat. You know, this review might be helpful to someone... Probably not. But hey, thanks for taking the time to update it. Good looking out. ;) 
...just sayin'.

While this ad blocker did get rid of ads (I was especially annoyed with seeing the same click bait-y ones on sites I visit daily), it reduced the speed of my Chromebook to the early days of dial up. Sites would often not load at all, due to timing out. I'm not just cruising FB and shopping--I'm a writer and need to have multiple tabs open at once for research while I'm working. The app just crashed my browser, so I'm done with it. I actually removed it and then had to reinstall it just to rate it, but once I review it, it's gone again. I can't deal with the hanging. A minute to load some blogs? Nope. Too bad--I loved getting rid of that baby with all the carrot appendages. If you've been annoyed by that ad, you'll know what I mean. ;-)

My old ad blocker which I had used for years just wasn't working anymore. So many popups kept coming through. Then ads which where supposed to be blocked also started seeping through. I deleted it and installed Adguard. Now, it is blocking everything again just like my old ad blocker did in the past. All those annoying and sometimes dangerous popups are gone once more. Right now, I would say that Adguard is one of the best ad blockers around for the Chrome browser.

Used a # of adblockers, in different browsers for a while, and I've been luckily to avoid malware-as-adblocker. And if you use multiple browsers, it gets marginally more complicated. They work well enough, being more or less powerful (and annoying.)

Adguard is one adblocker to rule them all. :-) 

It is working smoothly for months on latest Mac OS X on an last gen iMac. 

Adguard simplifies setting up monitoring an adblock. Opt to protect local OS and/or browsers and/or mobile OS in added value versions.

I have mixed feelings about this one. They advertise it as a fast and lightweight alternative to ABP, but in my experience it's neither faster nor more conservative with resources.

Compared to ABP (which I had installed until a few days ago) it makes the whole browser hang while loading pages I frequent. That's not optimal, even though it does pretty darn well when it comes to blocking ads.

Suffice to say I'm switching back to ABP until this is resolved.

Well, it's disabled now. Maybe the producer can tell me what to do to get it working properly again.
Thanks.

I don't use this on its own for this EXACT reason. When the total rules count exceeds something like 100,000, the extension has a LOT of work to do to find what to block and what to not block. This causes AdGuard to hog up memory in Chrome and slow down the browser. Try to keep the rules count under 50,000 and you're fine. Also, I forgot which filter causes the email trouble, but I think there AdGuard is trying to block phishing links even though the links are fine.

This extension is very useful, but it makes my browser start too slow.

It's pretty darn good, but so is U-block Origin. However, lately both of these are really starting to slow down my browsing experience. I have a pretty fast system but when enabled (and most features enabled too) I really notice a lot of lag when opening up webpages.

I bet most people aren't aware of all the settings as the GUI isn't very intuitive. And that should be changed because even though I have used Adguard for a few years now, I sometimes forget to enable all the settings I need and saving the settings to file isn't 100% reliable (another issue with this extension). 

I suggest the makers of Adguard look at U-block origin and their settings.It's much more simpler and straight-forward to manage in regards to the filters.

I can not believe how lucky I find myself after I found this gem! I was using the OTHER program that was supposed to block ads but basically were in league with ad companies! 

This program is 1000% recommended! No ads, blocks anything, clean and FAST browsing!

It used to be alright, but now it is for some odd reason slowing down all of my web browsers. I have this installed = Slow video loading, page loading etc.

This is a must-have extension. I use Google Chrome on a Chromebook and some sites are so loaded with ads that it really slowed me down. Once I got Ad Gaurd, it blocked all those annoyances so pages could load faster - and I could get on with my life. Delightfully, it required NO set up. I just installed it and it went to work. Best of all, I still have full control to block or unblock whatever I want, whenever I want.  Great app!

Pros
>Sleek, works super good on hundreds of sites, probably thousands
>I like the little green sheild icon, it's nice graphic design in my opinion
>Blocks about half of the pop-up ads
>The only adblock I would reccomend. I put it on my mother's computer.
>Sites can detect it, but it's easy to disable and it remembers which sites you've toggled it off on.

Cons
>Blocks only about half of the pop-up ads
>Sometimes, seemingly, it will block hundreds of ads one at a time until it reaches "infinity", which can make older computers running Chrome slow.

this has been the most useful add blocker yet i went and used Microsoft edge was and was like why is there so many ads then i remembered i had this on chrome this dose everything you want for a add blocker as long as your computer is not super slow already at using webpages and your not opening 20 tabs at a time you this should work perfectly and not even notice the time difference

While this ad blocker did get rid of ads (I was especially annoyed with seeing the same click bait-y ones on sites I visit daily), it reduced the speed of my Chromebook to the early days of dial up. Sites would often not load at all, due to timing out. I'm not just cruising FB and shopping--I'm a writer and need to have multiple tabs open at once for research while I'm working. The app just crashed my browser, so I'm done with it. I actually removed it and then had to reinstall it just to rate it, but once I review it, it's gone again. I can't deal with the hanging. A minute to load some blogs? Nope. Too bad--I loved getting rid of that baby with all the carrot appendages. If you've been annoyed by that ad, you'll know what I mean. ;-)

I was very happy with Adguard AdBlocker for a long time. For the last couple months, my websites have been loading very slow and images have been flickering and moving around the screen (especially on Amazon). I thought I had a virus or malware or something. Kept running my anti-virus and a couple different malware removal tools with no luck fixing it. Decided to check my extensions and saw that everyone else is having the same problem. Please fix so I don't have to go back to ABP

It's been great so far! However, today when I went into my AOL mail, the app was grayed out and it said "This website is in the exceptions. Filtering is disabled because it can interfere with this website's working". This is a problem, because AOL is one of the most bogged-down websites in terms of ads, which makes it slow to get through all the emails I have every day.

This tool does nothing more than insert a huge block of CSS inside the "Head" of the website which attempts to guess the CSS class name of potential ads on the page. 

This is a rudimentary approach that can easily be circumvented by advertisers coming up with a class name not covered by the inserted CSS. This will lead to updates that will steadily increase the size of the inserted CSS.

If the developer could find a way of ensuring that this CSS is inserted at the beginning of the website's "Head" then it would at least avoid causing the site to slow down, however as it is inserted at the end it causes the site to load all other CSS files synchronously rather than asynchonously.

If you're a web developer I would seriously avoid this extension.

I have mixed feelings about this one. They advertise it as a fast and lightweight alternative to ABP, but in my experience it's neither faster nor more conservative with resources.

Compared to ABP (which I had installed until a few days ago) it makes the whole browser hang while loading pages I frequent. That's not optimal, even though it does pretty darn well when it comes to blocking ads.

Suffice to say I'm switching back to ABP until this is resolved.
-------------------------

I must say this is truly fast and lightweight than ABP, I just opened a couple of websites that have lots of ads and it blocked it with default settings, and it consumed less memory than ABP for about 50%.. AWESOME.. hope to see more of your updates

block - 8
detect
Bitwarden is a really good password manager. But, after using it with Windows 10, and making some tests, I consider there are some things Lastpass still does better, which stop me from changing to Bitwarden:

1) Killing Other Sessions, manually (if you lose your laptop, for example). Result of my test: LastPass does log out in 2 minutes, and Bitwarden didn't log out after more than 3 hours. Much longer than "1 hour", as stated in the "Deauthorize All Sessions" help section. 

2) Automatic Log Out (From Other Sessions). Related to the previous point, LastPass has the option to automatically (instantly) log out from all sessions, except from the one being used.

3) Clear Clipboard. Simply does not work in Bitwarden, although it has the option.

4) LastPass is more user friendly in general. With notes area more accessible and comfortable (less editing clicks and more visible), Password Generator is really good and easy on LastPass, etc

Regarding the autofill, both Biwarden and LastPass have this feature, and it is an dangerous thing for your security. In my opinion, it shouldn't even exist as an option, since the benefit of this feature is very small compared to the potential risk. In LastPass, this terrible setting is is enabled by default. Biwarden does it a bit better, since it is disabled by default. 
It is very disturbing that both are also filling in data even though it is only a subdomain. At least Bitwarden does it a bit better again, because there is an option to "Default URI Match Detection" = "Exact".

I hope Bitwarden can improve these details, so I can change without hesitation to a password manager that will be surely much better, if not yet. I will edit this review too and give a 5 star review, if the improvements are made.
-------------------------

Latest update seems to have broken my password and locked my account completely. Thanks. 

Edit; Turns out its the captcha that doesn't actually work in the addon popup itself blocking it. Don't even know why this was added.
-------------------------
prevent
You have an adblock active? May interfere with the capcha. Also can try clearing the cache for BitWarden in settings. I accidently set the lockout period to 0 (which they really should prevent you from doing) but clearing the cache AND reinstalling the extension was able to reset it again.
-------------------------
detect
Amazing tool!! Encryption and all the rest of the features are working great for me! Only downside is on my Android 5 phone (can't know for newer Android versions or other builds/firmwares etc) autofill is useless, since the detected URI is always sth like an internal root path to my browser app and not the actual site I'm trying to log into. Could probably be cause I use Brave browser...
-------------------------
detect
I love it and love the autofill feature, but what is missing is the automatic password detection when I create an account or some login instances with a new account not previously saved, it works fine when I change the password but not when I create a new account.
-------------------------
detect
The free version of this is a huge upgrade over LastPass Premium which costs $36/year. It has a cleaner UX and notable features that are missing from LastPass, like an easy to self-host open source server and the ability to lock the browser extension automatically when your OS locks. It also seems to be less buggy, with better detection of username/password form fields, and a reliable fingerprint scanner (LastPass logs you out if you scan your fingerprint on Chrome on Android at the moment and then you need to enter your master password).
-------------------------
detect
Måste ändra lite i recensionen. Har märkt att - ibland - fyller den inte formulär eller kreditkortsinformation automatiskt har jag upptäckt nu. Det kan bero på att, som utvecklaren svarat mig, att de ännu inte stöder "backup detection for the swedish language yet". Men det är ett program under utveckling så de fixar det nog. Alla logins funkar dock precis som de ska.
-------------------------
protect
At last I found a good solution for managing my private information. 

I particularly love that BW supports 2FA, so even if someone keylogs my password they still have to bypass 2FA protections.

My only gripes (macOS Sierra):
1) Chrome extension does not auto-save a new entry. When I start entering information, and switch away to another window, the information initially entered is lost.
2) Occassionally, I have to tap the button-bar icon a number of times to get the window to open.
-------------------------
--------------------------------------------------
ads - 4
popup
Bitwarden is great, but specifically the Chrome extension has some usability issues. Specifically:

- If you move away from the Bitwarden pop-up window, then the window disappears and you lose whatever you were doing. For example, if I am in the middle of editing an entry and I move to another tab or app on the computer, then I lose all my work and have to start completely from scratch. Other extensions don't have this problem. At least, it would help to have a setting that keeps the window open until either the app locks per the session expiration settings, the user closes or saves the Bitwarden window, or a password is filled. Or, this functionality could be an optional setting to avoid unwanted security issues.
- Filling non-password data is a pain. It takes a while to find the data, and then sometimes it fills into the wrong field. It would be better to be able to choose specific data for a specific field from a right-click menu, similar to how the password generation function works.
- Some text fields don't have a copy button. This means that in order to use the data, I have to edit the field, manually select the text, and manually copy it. A copy button should be on all fields.

-------------------------
popup
Great extension! I have been using Bitwarden for a while now and like a lot of the features in it. For example, I use the Vivaldi browser and the popup works very well as a web-panel. There is only one thing that I do not like about it. If I set my username, it does not always work with Autofill because some accounts require an email address instead. I still like to access the username without having to log in, so I do not want to change the username in the vault. A way that I think this should be done is that you can set a list of emails in the bitwarden settings. Then, in the login's settings, there will be a drop-down to choose if it autofills with the username or with any of the set emails.
-------------------------
popup
Could be a Great app, however there is a major issue. Whenever I update passwords or create new accounts there is no prompt to add this to my vault. There is no popup that asks to save or update my details 80% of the time. It only works on some very specific websites, and it's extremely unpredictable. So most of the time you have to manually go into the Bitwarden extension and edit passwords/add accounts which really isn't very convenient and is one of the main reasons I use a password manager. Other password managers manages to do this almost flawlessly, so I don't see why Bitwarden can't. 

Same thing happens for the Android and iPad app, and it's just so annoying and I can't stay with this app until there is a fix that allows users to conveniently add/update account info without having to manually do it in the app.

Unfixably buggy. No amount of uninstalling, reinstalling, restarting, etc, etc, will get this extension to work again. Just impossible to log in (not wrong password - no error prompt at all). Has happened several times before but then at least disabling+shutting down, un+reinstalling, re-starting machine, etc, has eventually got it to work again. But not this time. A password manager you can't log in to... great! Will find another password manager.

Great extension, but when is multiple vault access coming?

Functionality is ok except I've tried for hours to enable browser integration. I can get it integrated once if I delete the browser extension, reboot, reinstall the extension then select "biometrics" in the extension interface. But then it then it asks for master password immediately (again) and reverts to giving me the "browser integration not enabled" error. So frustrating I'm gonna dump it and go back to LastPass mainly because I don't trust a buggy app.
-------------------------

Just OK - had two problems (1) can't access trash if you have no passwords saved in the vault (you have to create a fake password and save it just so you can see the trash UI, and (2) won't remember master password so I had to enter it over and over again every time I wanted to save another password.

Still an awesome password manager, but like others commented here, the latest updates broke the vault lockout option. Simply closing the Chrome window on MacOS (not quitting the browser) automatically locks the vault, prompting password reentry. Changing vault timeout settings to '1 hour' or 'never' does not fix the issue.

On the M1 pro this extension adds spaces to generated passwords. This is something that made me lose access to environments a couple of times now. 
Another annoying thing is that when you click between tabs the generated password vanishes and result is that when you want to click save it there is nothing to safe anymore. 
If a page gets redirected a couple times this happens your generated password then is gone.
-------------------------
bug
Worked great up until about the last week, now it logs me out 5 times a day for no reason. I have it set to log out only when I restart my browser, but it seems to just do it whenever it wants to recently. Hopefully just a bug that will be fixed next update?
-------------------------
break
After tons of research and getting so tired of having other similar systmes (Lastpass) getting worse at every update and askign for payment for every feature, I chose bitwarden!

Worked for a month. first upgrade broke the thing. It is now dead slow and keeps locking, so I need to reenter the master password 20 times a day. Not worth it, I think I am going to go back to the post it option. While not secure, at least I do not have to spend days troubleshooting something that is supposed to save time.
I do not know how they have no QA service to test this stuff before releasing updates. and with no way to downgrade, I give up, let me remove this thing from Chrome on all my devices. What a waste of time. A password manager basic functions should be simple. How do they manage to break the most basic functions of the app at every update?

Well this was a handy dandy extension.  Until it stopped loading. Just all grey. After uninstalling it, removing traces form my computer, and reinstalling, I am experience a forced time out every time I restart Chrome.  No changes in settings will stop this. Which means every time I load up Chrome, I have to reenter my Master Password, then reload every open page because it won't autofill upon clicking on an already opened page.  This bug has reduced the usability of the extension.  Help was no help as my problem was misunderstood.

Just migrated from KeePass (this serves me great for the the years). The problem was it need a local copy/cache of database in specific device like mobile/tablet.

Where as this (Bitwarden which is hosted somewhere). I do not need to cache/copy the local database.

Came here after LastPass failed me. Again. The second time. The interface is good (not quite VERY good) compared with LP's ... but the price is better (for cross-platform), the reliability is better, the way data is laid out in the vault is as good or better and the little things that are lacking are LITTLE things. For instance auto-fill on page load sometimes fails behind my extremely slow ISP. But Ctl-Shift-L works quite nicely (so does right-click and choose). If LastPass asked me back, (by being free cross platform) I'd turn 'em down.
-------------------------
error
Very pleased overall but getting a "failed to fetch" error sometimes on my desktop in my Brave browser on Windows 10 when I want to add a login. All latest updates. Need to remove the extension and reinstall it before it works again. 
Logging out does not work, when I want to log in again I get the same message. Need to reinstall the extension. Very annoying.
-------------------------
bug
stopped syncing properly on chrome, still syncing on firefox. may be related to the bug that many have where it doesn't save passwords when you log into a site it doesn't already have info for. I'm reinstalling now to hopefully fix it, but this is unacceptable regardless.

stop
A long time Lastpass user. They stopped supporting multiple devices of different types since March in this year.

bug
Bitwarden is light, so it works all the time, Lastpass has a fancy UI and features but it's buggy and pple never stop complaining. Scroll on these reviews, and try to see how many negative reviews you can see. Get on Lastpass and see the number of complains. Have used Bitwarden for more than two years now and it has never failed even once, it always works, always. May be this is how a password manager should be, light and works all the time, make it fancy, you'll bloat it, and you'll always have bugs and endless complains.

In Vivaldi (v. 3.8.2259.42) the Bitwarden extension is all of a sudden non-responsive. 
It does not reckonise the login pages and I can't access my vault anymore!!??
-------------------------
access
At some point I decided I didn't want to trust the Chrome browser with the keys to my digital kingdom, at which point I set about in earnest to discover a new password manager.  Something cross platform that isn't tied to my browser.  Bitwarden was my choice because the unRaid OS community regarded it highly and I have a lot of faith in their collective opinions.

This browser extension is *the* critical component of the entire Bitwarden service for your average home user since the majority of passwords you are going to need to keep are for online web-portals for your various accounts (banking, govt, email, etc).  I really like it a lot.  After exporting all my account passwords from the Chrome password manager I set about changing the most important ones, a security habit most of us are woefully behind on doing.  I've had the same variation of 2-3 passwords for over a decade and upgrading to Bitwarden is an ideal time to change them.  It's time consuming but a good way to flex your Bitwarden powers a little bit and get familiar with the password generator.

Now I have one master password for everything, and most of my account passwords are random strings of pure gibberish that would be impossible to remember individually.  Just make sure your master password is long and random enough to make it strong.  Don't worry, you will type it so frequently it will be hard to forget.  But take precautions!  There is no "forgot my password" link to click if you do forget your master password.  All your secure passwords managed by Bitwarden are stored with encryption.  Bitwarden doesn't even have access to them.  So make sure to write down your recovery code that they provide you and *store it someplace very safe*.  That recovery code is the only way to get back the keys to your digital kingdom if you forget the master password.

For extra precautions I recommend getting a security token like Yubikey and setting up 2FA along with a TOTP key to use.  Remember that whenever you see "Google Authenticator" listed as a SFA option that just means a TOTP key which you can use/store with Bitwarden.  Google Authenticator doesn't remember your original key, it just spits out the cycling TOTP code produced by the original key... so if you need to recover it that's a problem.  It is possible to lock yourself out of your own Bitwarden account because you turned on 2FA, so make sure you have TWO 2FA options to login with.

Really great extension, but it's really just the window dressing on a substantially more powerful enterprise level authentication technology which are the real bones of what makes this a good password manager.

load
Lastpass shoots itself in the head... cue mass exodus from Lastpass. Unfortunately, it doesn't automatically auto-fill - it's a right-click job. Can't understand why auto-fill on page load an 'experimental feature' when Lastpass does it so well, even when checked it still doesn't fill.
-------------------------

There is an option to auto fill in on page load, try that out, alternatively you can right click on a password field and bitwarden would be visible with the options to populate the password.

There is a constant sync problem with Bitwarden account. When I'm trying to add new password from a domain directly from addon, I'm getting 'Failed to fetch error', items added directly in web vault don't show on the extension. When trying to start sync manually from the addon, I'm getting notice that sync wasn't successful. I also tried to reinstall the plugin - after 5 minutes it stopped working again.
-------------------------
error
Im so happy this is avail what with lastpass being dodgy. When I deleted my lastpass acct I left them feedback and explained that what they are doing is alienating a lot of people. I hope they soon see the error of their ways. The Import process was super easy and Im all set up on bitwarden.
-------------------------
access
I just have an issue, but I found the solution. On smartphone app Bitwarden don't identify the app and shows me a list of ALL passwords to chose. So I had to change some configs into URI settings for this app password, now he shows me on top of that list the app entry, but still shows below a hole list of passwords. I expected have only the password's app listed

I also think that the link to the web Bitwarden could be more accessible, right on the top of the extension menu

But overall I'm very satisfying. His UI is better then Lastpass
-------------------------
access
Last Pass is limiting more functionality with a paywall, so I checked out Bitwarden—for free it can do everything I used Last Pass for (access, autofill, and generate passwords cross-platform) and actually Bitwarden's UI and layout is much cleaner.

And its paid service starts so low as 83 cents per month ($10 annually)—so modest an ask to support the developers.
-------------------------

Very good password manager, however the autofill sometimes doesn't work on page load, I need to open My Vault and find the appropriate login item.
-------------------------
access
Bitwarden is not only the best password manager ever, but includes TOTP authentication codes for Premium users at $10/year.  (That's right, per YEAR).  Unlike Google Authenticator and similar apps, when you store authenticator keys in Bitwarden you don’t lose your keys if you have to replace your phone. Bitwarden provides access to TOTP codes via the Chrome extension *and* the phone app; the keys are included when you export the Bitwarden vault; the keys are migrated when you set up a new device.  If the login has an authenticator key attached to it, the TOTP verification code is automatically copied to your clipboard whenever you auto-fill the login.  When asked for your 2FA code, just Ctrl+V. BRILLIANT!!!!!!!
-------------------------
error
I see several issues with this extension:
1) I make extensive use of Secure Notes in Lastpass to contain information and Bitwarden for some unexplained reason can not accommodate some of these secure notes since they exceed some 10,000 encrypted character length, This causes a cryptic error message when one attempts to import these secure notes into BitWarden.
2) Unlike in Lastpass one can not attached files to secure notes which I again have made use of
3) Secure notes or passwords can not be further secured by having to have use be prompted for the master password
4) Secure notes are displayed by the extension in the same width as normal login pull down. It makes reading the information in notes a bit cumbersome. 
4) Filling in login fields for sites that have multiple logins is not as easy as in Lastpass where the password fields have icons one can click on and select which account to use.
-------------------------
bug
- Autofill NOT WORKING
- New Login Save NOT WORKING
Very raw extension - a lot of bugs and not working features. Regret switching from LastPass!

error
Can't sign in with the Chrome extension. I tried multiple times, works if I open https://vault.bitwarden.com but not if I try to sign in in the chrome extension.
The error is a very generic one:
"An error has occurred
Failed to fetch"

I love bitwarden, works really well on Desktop (Mac app), Mobile and the website is also great, the only thing that doesn't work is the Chrome extension. This 1 star rating is only for the extension, bitwarden (the service & apps) in itself is great!
-------------------------
access
Very nice extension.
However, the interface is a bit limited and it would be cool to be able to customize it. For example, I frequently use secure notes but I have to do 4 clicks to access them.
-------------------------
access
The extension needs to offer an option to automatically logout after some determined time. I want to force using the 2fa each time I access my account. This also applies to the phone app.
-------------------------
stop
Why access to clipboard?? Please explain why or remove access to clipboard. I'm bit concerned and planning to stop using bitwarden because of suspicious permissions.

Update: Thanks for the explanation. Changed 1 star to 4 stars.
-------------------------
access
So you'd rather passwords just remained on your computer's clipboard history after you've copy & pasted them? Where any program or extension that has access to your clipboard could access them or if somebody else sits down at your computer? Or you could accidentally paste your password somewhere because it's still in your clipboard from an hour ago.. What a bizarre thing to want! 

All the other password managers already do this & this was a much needed security feature.
-------------------------

That was my experience with the LogMeIn remote access service also. Regular price increases. Bad business.

error
Can't give a rating yet, downloaded it moments ago.  BUT is DOES concern me that when I go to the website, Chrome says 
This site can’t provide a secure connection
bitwarden.com uses an unsupported protocol.
ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH
HIDE DETAILS
Unsupported protocol
The client and server don't support a common SSL protocol version or cipher suite. This is likely to be caused when the server needs RC4, which is no longer considered secure.

If simply going to their website (for support or even just to look around) is prohibited as "unsupported protocol" then I am to trust my data to it?  

Chrome is VERY annoying with this error message, trying to FORCE all websites to some standard.  I am not a programmer and don't know what it all means, but I am really sick of Chrome.  And now this?  What does it all mean?
-------------------------
access
Normally when you're talking to a website, you are not going directly to an application but to a web server such as apache, which negotiates all elements of encryption on behalf of something like bitwarden, which the web server sees as an application.  The application itself isn't responsible for the encryption protocols, which are handled on its behalf by the web server.

Doubly true of bitwarden.com as its public access is handled thru Cloudflare, a company I know of as I work with a customer of theirs, and I'm familiar with their reputation.  What your browser talks to when you go to connect with https://bitwarden.com is a Cloudflare server, which negotiates the connection then proxies between you and Bitwarden.  So your browser isn't seeing the bitwarden application directly, or even the web server Bitwarden runs.  Instead your browser sees the Cloudflare webserver.

Cloudflare is a technically very sophisticated company, and absolutely on top of their game.  However, it is possible they do not accept connections under older protocols now considered insecure.  If you are running a very old version of Chrome it is possible your Chrome does not support any protocol supported by Cloudflare.

I'm running Google Chrome 78.0 which reports no problem when I browse to https://bitwarden.com.  What version Chrome are you running?

Even if you are running newer chrome, if you are behind a firewall which itself tries to proxy https connections, it is possible the protocols the firewall offers don't include any Cloudflare will honor.  This is unlikely if you are behind a home firewall.  Much more common behind corporate firewalls.  It would need a fairly old or out-of-date firewall to cause this problem.

You might try browsing directly to https://cloudflare.com to see if you can get a connection there.

Lets go back in time, I was using same password for all websites , some time later I started using different password for all websites as it was hard to remember all password I tend to use simple non-secure mostly used passwords , then started to use some password managers and I couldn't sleep at night in a fear that some random password manager company has access to all my passwords. Then bitwarden came to save my digital life and now I have some random 64 letter long password different for all my websites and I can sleep knowing that it is an open source and encrypted even Bitwarden cant access my data. 5 stars are not enough for this wonderful app.

Yet another LP jumper, and I haven't looked back since (except to export my parents' info out and get them onto Bitwarden).

Besides the excellent functionality with this Chrome extension, I also use the Android app with mobile Chrome.

I do occasionally run across scripted sites that BW can't access the proper UI elements, but that's more of a problem with the web developers than the extension.

There's only one thing I do miss from LP, and that's having the icons show up in the input fields so I don't have to mouse to the top of the browser or play whack-a-right-click-menu.
-------------------------
bug
Giving BW a test run to replace LP. Pretty decent, but I miss little touches from LP like the ability to create folders on the fly and move items directly into them. As I organize my logins in BW, I'm finding that if I need a new folder, I have to close out of editing the item, click somewhere else to create a folder, then go select that item, then click elsewhere to tell BW where to move it, and click again to complete the move. In LP, I can type the name of the folder right in the item's window. If the folder already exists, I can move it there directly. If it doesn't exist, it will create it. Beyond obvious needs like security, organization is one of most important reasons for me to use a password manager to manage hundreds/thousands of logins. BW is cumbersome in this respect.

I also miss the icon right in the login field to choose a login. Having to right-click and look several levels deep in a context menu is another irritant. (Yes, I can get to it with fewer clicks through the menu bar, but it's not the same as having it right there where I'm focused on the login fields.)

BW doesn't seem to recognize when I've just changed my password on a website and prompt me to save the updated password like LP and Chrome's built-in password manager do. That's a huge negative.

BW doesn't seem to sync automatically. Changes I make in my vault on the web aren't reflected locally until I force a manual sync. LP got changes immediately.

On the plus side, an email to BW support about a bug was replied to almost immediately. That's cool.

Still undecided on this and keeping my options (and mind) open. Right now two stars seems generous given the painful shortcomings described above.

I was a long time personal @1password user but have been more and more frustrated over the years as they pivoted their business model to SaaS based. All the legacy tech is a burden.

The only thing I don't like is how slow the extensions load but I assume that will be fixed soon.

Bitwarden does not download any JavaScript from google.com. The extension even contains a content security policy that would forbid that from ever happening.

manual
Bitwarden is a really good password manager. But, after using it with Windows 10, and making some tests, I consider there are some things Lastpass still does better, which stop me from changing to Bitwarden:

1) Killing Other Sessions, manually (if you lose your laptop, for example). Result of my test: LastPass does log out in 2 minutes, and Bitwarden didn't log out after more than 3 hours. Much longer than "1 hour", as stated in the "Deauthorize All Sessions" help section. 

2) Automatic Log Out (From Other Sessions). Related to the previous point, LastPass has the option to automatically (instantly) log out from all sessions, except from the one being used.

3) Clear Clipboard. Simply does not work in Bitwarden, although it has the option.

4) LastPass is more user friendly in general. With notes area more accessible and comfortable (less editing clicks and more visible), Password Generator is really good and easy on LastPass, etc

Regarding the autofill, both Biwarden and LastPass have this feature, and it is an dangerous thing for your security. In my opinion, it shouldn't even exist as an option, since the benefit of this feature is very small compared to the potential risk. In LastPass, this terrible setting is is enabled by default. Biwarden does it a bit better, since it is disabled by default. 
It is very disturbing that both are also filling in data even though it is only a subdomain. At least Bitwarden does it a bit better again, because there is an option to "Default URI Match Detection" = "Exact".

I hope Bitwarden can improve these details, so I can change without hesitation to a password manager that will be surely much better, if not yet. I will edit this review too and give a 5 star review, if the improvements are made.
-------------------------
manual
Bitwarden is great, but specifically the Chrome extension has some usability issues. Specifically:

- If you move away from the Bitwarden pop-up window, then the window disappears and you lose whatever you were doing. For example, if I am in the middle of editing an entry and I move to another tab or app on the computer, then I lose all my work and have to start completely from scratch. Other extensions don't have this problem. At least, it would help to have a setting that keeps the window open until either the app locks per the session expiration settings, the user closes or saves the Bitwarden window, or a password is filled. Or, this functionality could be an optional setting to avoid unwanted security issues.
- Filling non-password data is a pain. It takes a while to find the data, and then sometimes it fills into the wrong field. It would be better to be able to choose specific data for a specific field from a right-click menu, similar to how the password generation function works.
- Some text fields don't have a copy button. This means that in order to use the data, I have to edit the field, manually select the text, and manually copy it. A copy button should be on all fields.
-------------------------
manual
Still not possible to manually set the language in the Chrome extension. Color is terrible. The good old blue, Bitwarden used in the past was nice, the new agressive blue makes me want to cancel my subscription. And then simple things missing since years (see Bitwarden community forum). Unfortunately Bitwarden is more and more concentrating on enterprise users (understandable since this is how they make money...).
-------------------------
off
The inability to turn off the pop up "Do you want Bitwarden to save this password?" when the account is locked is incredibly annoying. Unless you sit around with your account unlocked 100% of the time, Bitwarden extension is going to ask this over, and over, and over, and over, and over again ad nauseum. And in many sites, it covers up important navigation links, forcing you to close the pop up every time it pops up.
-------------------------
manual
I'm another convert from LastPass after the continual price hikes.  Currently using BW Free, but will likely upgrade to Premium.

Overall, it's solid.  I trust them, which is the biggest factor.  I may end up self hosting on my Unraid box, may stay cloud. As far as password managers go, they're great in nearly everything, except some of the UI/UX.  Some of which are incredibly frustrating when compared to LastPass, hence the three stars.

- Auto fill is flakey at best and you have to manually change every login to autofill, as by default, autofill is disabled.

- I *really* wish they would do an icon in the user/password field like LastPass does, regardless if autofill is enabled or disabled.  It requires too many clicks in it's current form to get to the extension, select the site, etc.

- Folders.  Why in gods name can you not create a new folder when you're adding a new site?  Instead you have to back out, go to Settings, Folders, Manager Folders.  Adding a new folder should be part of the folder drop-down in the login edit/creation box.

I know they aren't major issues, but they're multiple time a day issues for me and I'd bet that I'm not the only one.  If this was my first password manager I might not weigh it so heavily.  But coming from LastPass, those few user experience issues REALLY detract from a otherwise great product.
-------------------------

Have been using this for more than 6 months. Really helpful and have had a good experience so far. 
But have come across some issues as well. Some of them - 

- Extension doesn't automatically update the credentials during change, for most of the websites. 
- Similar problem while signing-up on a new website as well. Asks to store credentials for a very few websites.
- My bigger concern - when I shut down my Mac without closing the Chrome, the extension remains signed-in automatically the next time I turn on my Mac. For better security reasons, I'd like my extension to ask for Bitwarden password every-time the browser gets closed, *or* the laptop is turned off. 

OS - BigSur 11.6
Chrome - Version 95.0.4638.54
Bit - 1.53.0

Hope some of these issues get rectified in near future. Until then, I keep recommending this to others for its benefits. 
Thanks to the devs.

If you actually turned the laptop off, the browser would get closed too.. think about it. What you are actually doing is putting your laptop to sleep, for this to lock your extension you need to choose vault time-out on system lock.
-------------------------
manual
Could be a Great app, however there is a major issue. Whenever I update passwords or create new accounts there is no prompt to add this to my vault. There is no popup that asks to save or update my details 80% of the time. It only works on some very specific websites, and it's extremely unpredictable. So most of the time you have to manually go into the Bitwarden extension and edit passwords/add accounts which really isn't very convenient and is one of the main reasons I use a password manager. Other password managers manages to do this almost flawlessly, so I don't see why Bitwarden can't. 

Same thing happens for the Android and iPad app, and it's just so annoying and I can't stay with this app until there is a fix that allows users to conveniently add/update account info without having to manually do it in the app.

This widget has so many lags, not possible to work with it at all. 
1. Whenever I try to add the password manually (apparently their nice feature of suggesting to save passwords does not work anymore) I just can't type at all. It take 15sec(!!!) for a typed character to appear. 
2. And if I want to fill a password and click on the widget, the LOGINS header overlaps the first login data, which makes it impossible to select a needed account. 
3. When I try to regenerate a password it also takes me around 30 seconds for a new password to appear. 
4. Not to mention the lags when trying to update a secure note, or a password. 

I was more happy with lastPass, actually, and NEVER experienced those lags. 
Shame on you, Bitwarden.

Overall it's great and in some ways better than LastPass, especially since the introduction of their new greedy payment scheme.
I turned on autofill, but unfortunately there is no way to exclude specific sites from it, something that I could do with LastPass, so had to turn it completely off.
Also would be great if, as in LastPass, I could click the form field and get a dropdown of the login accounts, instead of clicking the BW icon for that. And would be even better if such feature could be configurable to turn it on/off.
-------------------------
manual
As much as I hate Lastpass I'll probably go back to it after 2 weeks struggling with Bitwarden .  Bitwarden does NOT function like Lastpass; not even close.  Bitwarden cannot auto fill fields, cannot save new passwords.  everything must be done manually.  Does not work with Chrome on iOS.  Try it but don't pay for premium until you are sure it is worth the extra work.  Customer service and help is sorely lacking.  We need some way to find out how small these password manager startups are.  All the password manager companies are understaffed.
-------------------------

So - pretty nice once you get used to it.  I have just a couple of issues.  On one occasion, the desktop app wasn't synching down a lot of the passwords & accounts.  In fact it had a bunch of them and then somehow they were gone!  Thankfully, the online bitlocker still had it and uninstalling and reinstalling (yeah I tried other things like re-syncing first) the desktop version fixed it.  Then, just now, the extension was gone in Chrome.  Investigating - It was turned off by chrome because "it may have been corrupted" and offered to "repair?".  OK - so I opted to repair it which worked fine.  These experiences though are obnoxious and shake my confidence a little.  Might be super uncommon - I don't know.

Great extension! I have been using Bitwarden for a while now and like a lot of the features in it. For example, I use the Vivaldi browser and the popup works very well as a web-panel. There is only one thing that I do not like about it. If I set my username, it does not always work with Autofill because some accounts require an email address instead. I still like to access the username without having to log in, so I do not want to change the username in the vault. A way that I think this should be done is that you can set a list of emails in the bitwarden settings. Then, in the login's settings, there will be a drop-down to choose if it autofills with the username or with any of the set emails.

As it seems not to have the facility to import a list of passwords, I uninstalled it.

I'm very satisfied with BitWarden after leaving Last Pass.  The only reason I did not rate 5 stars is there are a couple of things missing.  I don't like having to scroll through all of my favorites to get to the folders.  It would be better if all the folders were listed including "favorites" that way it would be easier to navigate to the login you want.  I also miss the "recently used" in Last Pass.

At some point I decided I didn't want to trust the Chrome browser with the keys to my digital kingdom, at which point I set about in earnest to discover a new password manager.  Something cross platform that isn't tied to my browser.  Bitwarden was my choice because the unRaid OS community regarded it highly and I have a lot of faith in their collective opinions.

This browser extension is *the* critical component of the entire Bitwarden service for your average home user since the majority of passwords you are going to need to keep are for online web-portals for your various accounts (banking, govt, email, etc).  I really like it a lot.  After exporting all my account passwords from the Chrome password manager I set about changing the most important ones, a security habit most of us are woefully behind on doing.  I've had the same variation of 2-3 passwords for over a decade and upgrading to Bitwarden is an ideal time to change them.  It's time consuming but a good way to flex your Bitwarden powers a little bit and get familiar with the password generator.

Now I have one master password for everything, and most of my account passwords are random strings of pure gibberish that would be impossible to remember individually.  Just make sure your master password is long and random enough to make it strong.  Don't worry, you will type it so frequently it will be hard to forget.  But take precautions!  There is no "forgot my password" link to click if you do forget your master password.  All your secure passwords managed by Bitwarden are stored with encryption.  Bitwarden doesn't even have access to them.  So make sure to write down your recovery code that they provide you and *store it someplace very safe*.  That recovery code is the only way to get back the keys to your digital kingdom if you forget the master password.

For extra precautions I recommend getting a security token like Yubikey and setting up 2FA along with a TOTP key to use.  Remember that whenever you see "Google Authenticator" listed as a SFA option that just means a TOTP key which you can use/store with Bitwarden.  Google Authenticator doesn't remember your original key, it just spits out the cycling TOTP code produced by the original key... so if you need to recover it that's a problem.  It is possible to lock yourself out of your own Bitwarden account because you turned on 2FA, so make sure you have TWO 2FA options to login with.

Really great extension, but it's really just the window dressing on a substantially more powerful enterprise level authentication technology which are the real bones of what makes this a good password manager.

list
I just have an issue, but I found the solution. On smartphone app Bitwarden don't identify the app and shows me a list of ALL passwords to chose. So I had to change some configs into URI settings for this app password, now he shows me on top of that list the app entry, but still shows below a hole list of passwords. I expected have only the password's app listed

I also think that the link to the web Bitwarden could be more accessible, right on the top of the extension menu

But overall I'm very satisfying. His UI is better then Lastpass

Bitwarden is a really good password manager. But, after using it with Windows 10, and making some tests, I consider there are some things Lastpass still does better, which stop me from changing to Bitwarden:

1) Killing Other Sessions, manually (if you lose your laptop, for example). Result of my test: LastPass does log out in 2 minutes, and Bitwarden didn't log out after more than 3 hours. Much longer than "1 hour", as stated in the "Deauthorize All Sessions" help section. 

2) Automatic Log Out (From Other Sessions). Related to the previous point, LastPass has the option to automatically (instantly) log out from all sessions, except from the one being used.

3) Clear Clipboard. Simply does not work in Bitwarden, although it has the option.

4) LastPass is more user friendly in general. With notes area more accessible and comfortable (less editing clicks and more visible), Password Generator is really good and easy on LastPass, etc

Regarding the autofill, both Biwarden and LastPass have this feature, and it is an dangerous thing for your security. In my opinion, it shouldn't even exist as an option, since the benefit of this feature is very small compared to the potential risk. In LastPass, this terrible setting is is enabled by default. Biwarden does it a bit better, since it is disabled by default. 
It is very disturbing that both are also filling in data even though it is only a subdomain. At least Bitwarden does it a bit better again, because there is an option to "Default URI Match Detection" = "Exact".

I hope Bitwarden can improve these details, so I can change without hesitation to a password manager that will be surely much better, if not yet. I will edit this review too and give a 5 star review, if the improvements are made.

The Browser extension Biometric Authentication companion, needs some updates so they actually perform as expected. Or once I unlock the the desktop app the browser extension apps should also by default.
Now the review for everyone else....
I have used so, SO, SO, many of these types of Password Vaults, (as I am sure most of you have too!) Including Lastpass, NordPass, Norton, Keeper, all of the browser based ones. I used the free version for a full month(which is more than enough for the normal person) While the app is not as pretty as the others, the price tag you can not argue with. Oh yeah and it doesn't save your info like 
Lastpass was doing a while back.  and being able to install it on multiple devices as well as still being able to sign into the web site and see it online yup, without hesitation it was one of the first times I ever bought an app that fast for personal use without making the company pay for it.
-------------------------

I'm another convert from LastPass after the continual price hikes.  Currently using BW Free, but will likely upgrade to Premium.

Overall, it's solid.  I trust them, which is the biggest factor.  I may end up self hosting on my Unraid box, may stay cloud. As far as password managers go, they're great in nearly everything, except some of the UI/UX.  Some of which are incredibly frustrating when compared to LastPass, hence the three stars.

- Auto fill is flakey at best and you have to manually change every login to autofill, as by default, autofill is disabled.

- I *really* wish they would do an icon in the user/password field like LastPass does, regardless if autofill is enabled or disabled.  It requires too many clicks in it's current form to get to the extension, select the site, etc.

- Folders.  Why in gods name can you not create a new folder when you're adding a new site?  Instead you have to back out, go to Settings, Folders, Manager Folders.  Adding a new folder should be part of the folder drop-down in the login edit/creation box.

I know they aren't major issues, but they're multiple time a day issues for me and I'd bet that I'm not the only one.  If this was my first password manager I might not weigh it so heavily.  But coming from LastPass, those few user experience issues REALLY detract from a otherwise great product.

The bitwarden chrome extension automatically becomes locked really FREQUENTLY and has to enter the main password again to unlock it, which is very very frustrating. I have tried set the "Vault Timeout" config to "Never" or a very large custom value but with no luck.

Love that I get to host the data myself. Not only a great app but don't have to worry about syncing to some random server that I'll never truly know how secure it is. I do wish the Chrome extension remembered where i was last instead of defaulting back to the home tab but i'm sure people would be annoyed by that so I can see why its better left alone.

Migrated from LastPass. Better and lighter UI. Defaults to No Auto Fill (Better Security). Premium is 10$ a year (at the time of this writing). Opensource & Audited too. You can self host this software if privacy is your concern though end-to-end encryption pretty much guarantee privacy itself.

It would appear we are all singing from the same hymn book. LastPass became very arrogant when bought by LogMein. 
Not only IMO is Bitwarden a superior product, it's free. Keep up the good work and get those form fill option up and running. Once you have that as part of your default product you will be unstoppable.

Functionality is ok except I've tried for hours to enable browser integration. I can get it integrated once if I delete the browser extension, reboot, reinstall the extension then select "biometrics" in the extension interface. But then it then it asks for master password immediately (again) and reverts to giving me the "browser integration not enabled" error. So frustrating I'm gonna dump it and go back to LastPass mainly because I don't trust a buggy app.
-------------------------

Seconded. Love the app, super helpful and cross-compatible with many platforms that allows for cross-device integration (for example, my iPhone, Macbook, and Chrome). But as you said, memory usage is kind of ridiculous. App is currently not in use, just in the background.. yet it is taking up 275 mb, while my total browser memory is at 684. Takes up a huge chunk of it..

I always believed that the browser's built in password manager is the fastest and more reliable. This was the case when I used chrome for everything on every device because the ecosystem works pretty well. But now I have two browsers Brave and Microsoft edge for Organizational and personal needs. I also have firefox and also need to store passwords of android apps.
This is where Bitwarden came to the rescue. I always saw its promotional ad but never gave it a try before. Once frustrated on losing my passwords after losing the brave sync chain and microsoft organization account I was frustrated as hell. Bitwarden solves everything by implementing a many to one solution. One password manager on Brave, Edge, Firefox, Android. Super syncing.

But that TOTP service is not available. 

Problems I face with Bitwarden Android App:
Does not work well in autofilling in browsers in android. Most of the time it fills password in place of email and vice versa. While triggering Autofill, Unlocking it takes to a separate screen and coming back i see the login page is lost.

Still its powerful. Open source.
-------------------------
browser
First of all, It's litterly not working. This makes the extension completely useless. I'm on brave browser which is supported but its still not working. Whenever I try to log in or create an account, after filling out everything, it makes a random black box!
-------------------------
browser
Still an awesome password manager, but like others commented here, the latest updates broke the vault lockout option. Simply closing the Chrome window on MacOS (not quitting the browser) automatically locks the vault, prompting password reentry. Changing vault timeout settings to '1 hour' or 'never' does not fix the issue.
-------------------------
browser
Great extension which has lately much deteriorated in quality.
First everything become corrupted and after that it keeps locking (on computer sleep/standby?) even though the setting is only to lock on browser restart.
-------------------------

Bought Bitwarden Premium version and it worked fine with Brave browser/Windows 10 for about 2 weeks.  Then I had trouble with it continually asking for the master password even though the timeout is set for never.  I had to uninstall/reinstall the desktop app and the browser extension to get it to work properly again.
-------------------------
browser
Worked great up until about the last week, now it logs me out 5 times a day for no reason. I have it set to log out only when I restart my browser, but it seems to just do it whenever it wants to recently. Hopefully just a bug that will be fixed next update?

Switched from keepass to lastpass, then to bitwarden. Pay for premium and will continue to do so, even if I self host. Switched my family over as well. Very premium product and hoping to switch my company from LP to BW for api functionality alone. I don't rate extensions often but on any browser install it's ublock and bitwarden.

Great extension! I have been using Bitwarden for a while now and like a lot of the features in it. For example, I use the Vivaldi browser and the popup works very well as a web-panel. There is only one thing that I do not like about it. If I set my username, it does not always work with Autofill because some accounts require an email address instead. I still like to access the username without having to log in, so I do not want to change the username in the vault. A way that I think this should be done is that you can set a list of emails in the bitwarden settings. Then, in the login's settings, there will be a drop-down to choose if it autofills with the username or with any of the set emails.
-------------------------
browser
Have been using this for more than 6 months. Really helpful and have had a good experience so far. 
But have come across some issues as well. Some of them - 

- Extension doesn't automatically update the credentials during change, for most of the websites. 
- Similar problem while signing-up on a new website as well. Asks to store credentials for a very few websites.
- My bigger concern - when I shut down my Mac without closing the Chrome, the extension remains signed-in automatically the next time I turn on my Mac. For better security reasons, I'd like my extension to ask for Bitwarden password every-time the browser gets closed, *or* the laptop is turned off. 

OS - BigSur 11.6
Chrome - Version 95.0.4638.54
Bit - 1.53.0

Hope some of these issues get rectified in near future. Until then, I keep recommending this to others for its benefits. 
Thanks to the devs.

If you actually turned the laptop off, the browser would get closed too.. think about it. What you are actually doing is putting your laptop to sleep, for this to lock your extension you need to choose vault time-out on system lock.

Long time user of Bitwarden, used to use KeePass 2 and another one as my main password manager. Setup was easy, and its ease of use is why I continue to use it. My only complaint is sometimes it freezes on log in or while trying to input the info to login on multiple browsers not just Chrome.
-------------------------
browser
Amazing tool!! Encryption and all the rest of the features are working great for me! Only downside is on my Android 5 phone (can't know for newer Android versions or other builds/firmwares etc) autofill is useless, since the detected URI is always sth like an internal root path to my browser app and not the actual site I'm trying to log into. Could probably be cause I use Brave browser...

vault not locking in extension after browser restart
-------------------------
browser
I like the interface, but find it's not automatically adding new logins to Vault and I have no idea from the menus how to ensure that happens. In Settings there are things for Vault TimeOut and Vault Timeout Actions, but I don't know what Lock or TimeOut mean, practically speaking, and there doesn't seem to be any way to ensure Bitwarden is open for business any time I open up the Browser. Can't find such a description or option anywhere. So if it's not going to be adding new logins when I create them (LastPass does every time), then I don't see how I can keep using it, even though would like to. Hopefully the Developer can set me straight on this, but it's puzzling that the Settings are so complicated with most of the options not making any sense to me at all.
-------------------------
browser
Very pleased overall but getting a "failed to fetch" error sometimes on my desktop in my Brave browser on Windows 10 when I want to add a login. All latest updates. Need to remove the extension and reinstall it before it works again. 
Logging out does not work, when I want to log in again I get the same message. Need to reinstall the extension. Very annoying.

At some point I decided I didn't want to trust the Chrome browser with the keys to my digital kingdom, at which point I set about in earnest to discover a new password manager.  Something cross platform that isn't tied to my browser.  Bitwarden was my choice because the unRaid OS community regarded it highly and I have a lot of faith in their collective opinions.

This browser extension is *the* critical component of the entire Bitwarden service for your average home user since the majority of passwords you are going to need to keep are for online web-portals for your various accounts (banking, govt, email, etc).  I really like it a lot.  After exporting all my account passwords from the Chrome password manager I set about changing the most important ones, a security habit most of us are woefully behind on doing.  I've had the same variation of 2-3 passwords for over a decade and upgrading to Bitwarden is an ideal time to change them.  It's time consuming but a good way to flex your Bitwarden powers a little bit and get familiar with the password generator.

Now I have one master password for everything, and most of my account passwords are random strings of pure gibberish that would be impossible to remember individually.  Just make sure your master password is long and random enough to make it strong.  Don't worry, you will type it so frequently it will be hard to forget.  But take precautions!  There is no "forgot my password" link to click if you do forget your master password.  All your secure passwords managed by Bitwarden are stored with encryption.  Bitwarden doesn't even have access to them.  So make sure to write down your recovery code that they provide you and *store it someplace very safe*.  That recovery code is the only way to get back the keys to your digital kingdom if you forget the master password.

For extra precautions I recommend getting a security token like Yubikey and setting up 2FA along with a TOTP key to use.  Remember that whenever you see "Google Authenticator" listed as a SFA option that just means a TOTP key which you can use/store with Bitwarden.  Google Authenticator doesn't remember your original key, it just spits out the cycling TOTP code produced by the original key... so if you need to recover it that's a problem.  It is possible to lock yourself out of your own Bitwarden account because you turned on 2FA, so make sure you have TWO 2FA options to login with.

Really great extension, but it's really just the window dressing on a substantially more powerful enterprise level authentication technology which are the real bones of what makes this a good password manager.

I have to admit that I only came to Bitwarden because LastPass wanted too much money for normal consumer functionality, but I am very glad I did. Easy to use, easy to transfer from LastPass. The only small time-suck in the changeover (and this is of course nothing against Bitwarden) was to remove Lastpass extensions from browsers and Lastpass apps from phone tablet etc
-------------------------
browser
Been looking for a trusted solution of LastPass and found it in BitWarden.  Prices are great compared to other solutions and same functionalities I needed.  I love the fact that passwords are organized as folders and can be seen easily.  LastPass was a bit confusing to organize the passwords and I never really liked LP organization much.  It has family plan for a reason price with shared password.  Allows me to sync across devices with app for IOS and browser extensions.   You can even setup advanced features lie 2nd authentication for Yubi keys, Auth and email.  

I do wish it had more security features like login activities and disabling login from certain countries; but it does notify you of a new login.
-------------------------
browser
The free version of this is a huge upgrade over LastPass Premium which costs $36/year. It has a cleaner UX and notable features that are missing from LastPass, like an easy to self-host open source server and the ability to lock the browser extension automatically when your OS locks. It also seems to be less buggy, with better detection of username/password form fields, and a reliable fingerprint scanner (LastPass logs you out if you scan your fingerprint on Chrome on Android at the moment and then you need to enter your master password).
-------------------------

Used RoboForm for years, until I found Bitwarden. Bitwarden gives me all the features I want and at a much better price than RoboForm. You can also self host if you want, keeping your date closer to home, or on a cloud VPS of your choosing. It's open source, so the code is scrutinised by many, many programmers around the world. They also have their code checked by external auditors too. So, you can be certain that there are no back-doors, vulnerabilities or anything else untoward going on. I can use this on any of my browsers on Linux as well as my Android phone. I also have it extra secured with a YubiKey. Great Job Bitwarden!
-------------------------

I like many others am an ex Lastpass user which was going up in price exponentially each year. I'm still getting used to Bitwarden and have taken out the pro version. Only one thing I can't figure out is how to use 2FA in the browser extension. I've turned it on; on the Bitwarden web page login, but not on the extension and vault.

Ive been using Bitwarden for quite a while now but id thought it was time i reviewed it, Ive tried probably all the other password managers around but something was always missing either feature wise or device / OS support.  But then i found Bitwarden, not only does it do everything i need from a cloud based password manager it also supports just about every browser and every OS and every device available so ive got it installed on my desktops and mobiles.  I ended up purchasing the premium version for its Yubikey support which is icing on the cake.  I recommend it enough, if your looking for a password manager or are unhappy with your current manager then i highly suggest you try Bitwarden.
-------------------------

First time using a password manager. Don't know why I was ever afraid of using one before. Bitwarden extensions on all my browsers, and apps for both iPhone and Android. UX very similar throughout. I'm considering the paid version and even suggesting it for work.

migrated from lastpass. what i like is auto-fill forms is sometimes better than lastpass. far lighter and simpler than lastpass. open source app.

what i miss is, when multiple account of a same service has to be logged in, i cant switch  within username box itself. have to click icon on top.
and cant save masterpassword locally in browser also. its good thing security-vice. but tedious to type long master password again. like mobile app, a pin would be grate.

overall i would recommend it.

Normally when you're talking to a website, you are not going directly to an application but to a web server such as apache, which negotiates all elements of encryption on behalf of something like bitwarden, which the web server sees as an application.  The application itself isn't responsible for the encryption protocols, which are handled on its behalf by the web server.

Doubly true of bitwarden.com as its public access is handled thru Cloudflare, a company I know of as I work with a customer of theirs, and I'm familiar with their reputation.  What your browser talks to when you go to connect with https://bitwarden.com is a Cloudflare server, which negotiates the connection then proxies between you and Bitwarden.  So your browser isn't seeing the bitwarden application directly, or even the web server Bitwarden runs.  Instead your browser sees the Cloudflare webserver.

Cloudflare is a technically very sophisticated company, and absolutely on top of their game.  However, it is possible they do not accept connections under older protocols now considered insecure.  If you are running a very old version of Chrome it is possible your Chrome does not support any protocol supported by Cloudflare.

I'm running Google Chrome 78.0 which reports no problem when I browse to https://bitwarden.com.  What version Chrome are you running?

Even if you are running newer chrome, if you are behind a firewall which itself tries to proxy https connections, it is possible the protocols the firewall offers don't include any Cloudflare will honor.  This is unlikely if you are behind a home firewall.  Much more common behind corporate firewalls.  It would need a fairly old or out-of-date firewall to cause this problem.

You might try browsing directly to https://cloudflare.com to see if you can get a connection there.
-------------------------
browser
I might be little late to the party but the issue in the laymen terms is that your browser is not able to connect to the https(secure) site.  There could be multiple reasons for that but  "BItwarden is not secure" ain't one of them. Their code is open-source and anyone with good knowledge of programming can tell you how secure their code is.

Yet another LP jumper, and I haven't looked back since (except to export my parents' info out and get them onto Bitwarden).

Besides the excellent functionality with this Chrome extension, I also use the Android app with mobile Chrome.

I do occasionally run across scripted sites that BW can't access the proper UI elements, but that's more of a problem with the web developers than the extension.

There's only one thing I do miss from LP, and that's having the icons show up in the input fields so I don't have to mouse to the top of the browser or play whack-a-right-click-menu.
-------------------------
browser
I am coming over from Lastpass, to try it out. 
However, I have yet to find WHERE you can store secure NOTES, or your general BOOKMARKS file.
I find that launching from LastPass is easier, more intuitive: click on LP icon> Sites>Folders>(LaunchSite) by that I mean you click on the site and it launches it in a new browser tab. It's as simple as that.
When I click the BitWarden icon, I am presented with a barren window. Nothingness. Bravo geniuses! If I click on Vault - surely that's it! - nope, nothingness!  I did from within the Vault somehow add kijiji to appear when I click on the icon then vault. But now I can't replicate that- don't remember where I went or what I did to do that. 
But what the hell???  Why does it have to be user-hostile like this? Why can't it just let you scroll from the menu and launch a site, without the users having to jump through hoops? 

This app seems young, and still needs development in the intelligence of user-interface department. 
If you are going to copy LastPass, why not do it right?
-------------------------
browser
Hey Robbie,
Unfortunately not. Using lock options mean that your encryption key (master password) is only stored in memory with the browser session. If you close the browser that memory is lost, requiring you to enter it back in again.
-------------------------
browser
Please, add more features: 1. Open site-password in browser tabs while edit, but not in flying window. 2. When opening no field for site-pass search and need to follow to My vault to start search.
3. Can't fill passwords and logins in small authentication windows - lastpass can ((((

Bitwarden is a really good password manager. But, after using it with Windows 10, and making some tests, I consider there are some things Lastpass still does better, which stop me from changing to Bitwarden:

1) Killing Other Sessions, manually (if you lose your laptop, for example). Result of my test: LastPass does log out in 2 minutes, and Bitwarden didn't log out after more than 3 hours. Much longer than "1 hour", as stated in the "Deauthorize All Sessions" help section. 

2) Automatic Log Out (From Other Sessions). Related to the previous point, LastPass has the option to automatically (instantly) log out from all sessions, except from the one being used.

3) Clear Clipboard. Simply does not work in Bitwarden, although it has the option.

4) LastPass is more user friendly in general. With notes area more accessible and comfortable (less editing clicks and more visible), Password Generator is really good and easy on LastPass, etc

Regarding the autofill, both Biwarden and LastPass have this feature, and it is an dangerous thing for your security. In my opinion, it shouldn't even exist as an option, since the benefit of this feature is very small compared to the potential risk. In LastPass, this terrible setting is is enabled by default. Biwarden does it a bit better, since it is disabled by default. 
It is very disturbing that both are also filling in data even though it is only a subdomain. At least Bitwarden does it a bit better again, because there is an option to "Default URI Match Detection" = "Exact".

I hope Bitwarden can improve these details, so I can change without hesitation to a password manager that will be surely much better, if not yet. I will edit this review too and give a 5 star review, if the improvements are made.

Bitwarden is great, but specifically the Chrome extension has some usability issues. Specifically:

- If you move away from the Bitwarden pop-up window, then the window disappears and you lose whatever you were doing. For example, if I am in the middle of editing an entry and I move to another tab or app on the computer, then I lose all my work and have to start completely from scratch. Other extensions don't have this problem. At least, it would help to have a setting that keeps the window open until either the app locks per the session expiration settings, the user closes or saves the Bitwarden window, or a password is filled. Or, this functionality could be an optional setting to avoid unwanted security issues.
- Filling non-password data is a pain. It takes a while to find the data, and then sometimes it fills into the wrong field. It would be better to be able to choose specific data for a specific field from a right-click menu, similar to how the password generation function works.
- Some text fields don't have a copy button. This means that in order to use the data, I have to edit the field, manually select the text, and manually copy it. A copy button should be on all fields.

Came here after LastPass failed me. Again. The second time. The interface is good (not quite VERY good) compared with LP's ... but the price is better (for cross-platform), the reliability is better, the way data is laid out in the vault is as good or better and the little things that are lacking are LITTLE things. For instance auto-fill on page load sometimes fails behind my extremely slow ISP. But Ctl-Shift-L works quite nicely (so does right-click and choose). If LastPass asked me back, (by being free cross platform) I'd turn 'em down.

Amazing tool!! Encryption and all the rest of the features are working great for me! Only downside is on my Android 5 phone (can't know for newer Android versions or other builds/firmwares etc) autofill is useless, since the detected URI is always sth like an internal root path to my browser app and not the actual site I'm trying to log into. Could probably be cause I use Brave browser...

Just rolled over from LASTPASS to Bitwarden... was getting frustrated with the LP interface, with obscure icons and no prompt hints and buggy autofill and login captures... This BW is so much more intuitive with a good interface.. copied my LP data to BW in minutes,, painless

This widget has so many lags, not possible to work with it at all. 
1. Whenever I try to add the password manually (apparently their nice feature of suggesting to save passwords does not work anymore) I just can't type at all. It take 15sec(!!!) for a typed character to appear. 
2. And if I want to fill a password and click on the widget, the LOGINS header overlaps the first login data, which makes it impossible to select a needed account. 
3. When I try to regenerate a password it also takes me around 30 seconds for a new password to appear. 
4. Not to mention the lags when trying to update a secure note, or a password. 

I was more happy with lastPass, actually, and NEVER experienced those lags. 
Shame on you, Bitwarden. 

Note: I am on a latest stable version of Chrome.
-------------------------

Love that I get to host the data myself. Not only a great app but don't have to worry about syncing to some random server that I'll never truly know how secure it is. I do wish the Chrome extension remembered where i was last instead of defaulting back to the home tab but i'm sure people would be annoyed by that so I can see why its better left alone.
-------------------------
encrypt
At some point I decided I didn't want to trust the Chrome browser with the keys to my digital kingdom, at which point I set about in earnest to discover a new password manager.  Something cross platform that isn't tied to my browser.  Bitwarden was my choice because the unRaid OS community regarded it highly and I have a lot of faith in their collective opinions.

This browser extension is *the* critical component of the entire Bitwarden service for your average home user since the majority of passwords you are going to need to keep are for online web-portals for your various accounts (banking, govt, email, etc).  I really like it a lot.  After exporting all my account passwords from the Chrome password manager I set about changing the most important ones, a security habit most of us are woefully behind on doing.  I've had the same variation of 2-3 passwords for over a decade and upgrading to Bitwarden is an ideal time to change them.  It's time consuming but a good way to flex your Bitwarden powers a little bit and get familiar with the password generator.

Now I have one master password for everything, and most of my account passwords are random strings of pure gibberish that would be impossible to remember individually.  Just make sure your master password is long and random enough to make it strong.  Don't worry, you will type it so frequently it will be hard to forget.  But take precautions!  There is no "forgot my password" link to click if you do forget your master password.  All your secure passwords managed by Bitwarden are stored with encryption.  Bitwarden doesn't even have access to them.  So make sure to write down your recovery code that they provide you and *store it someplace very safe*.  That recovery code is the only way to get back the keys to your digital kingdom if you forget the master password.

For extra precautions I recommend getting a security token like Yubikey and setting up 2FA along with a TOTP key to use.  Remember that whenever you see "Google Authenticator" listed as a SFA option that just means a TOTP key which you can use/store with Bitwarden.  Google Authenticator doesn't remember your original key, it just spits out the cycling TOTP code produced by the original key... so if you need to recover it that's a problem.  It is possible to lock yourself out of your own Bitwarden account because you turned on 2FA, so make sure you have TWO 2FA options to login with.

Really great extension, but it's really just the window dressing on a substantially more powerful enterprise level authentication technology which are the real bones of what makes this a good password manager.

Great alternative to Lastpass. Importing all of my data was painless. I have yet to test out sharing features, but I have no need for them in my personal day to day.
-------------------------
data
Long time LastPass user, but now that they're charging for cross-platform data sharing it's time to jump ship. It was surprisingly easy to migrate from LP, and BitWarden has all the bells and whistles I need - which to be fair isn't a lot - it's simple and gets the job done - exactly what it should be. My only gripe is the secure notes are restricted in size. My secure notes from LP were too large for BitWarden so I'll have to split them up or something. Anyhow, this is probably not even a concern for most people so it's ***** from me.
-------------------------
data
I was using Lastpass, but I thing this is better than LastPass...........but I am confused about my password and security. Also data privacy. How about that ?
-------------------------
encrypt
I see several issues with this extension:
1) I make extensive use of Secure Notes in Lastpass to contain information and Bitwarden for some unexplained reason can not accommodate some of these secure notes since they exceed some 10,000 encrypted character length, This causes a cryptic error message when one attempts to import these secure notes into BitWarden.
2) Unlike in Lastpass one can not attached files to secure notes which I again have made use of
3) Secure notes or passwords can not be further secured by having to have use be prompted for the master password
4) Secure notes are displayed by the extension in the same width as normal login pull down. It makes reading the information in notes a bit cumbersome. 
4) Filling in login fields for sites that have multiple logins is not as easy as in Lastpass where the password fields have icons one can click on and select which account to use.
-------------------------
encrypt
Migrated from LastPass. Better and lighter UI. Defaults to No Auto Fill (Better Security). Premium is 10$ a year (at the time of this writing). Opensource & Audited too. You can self host this software if privacy is your concern though end-to-end encryption pretty much guarantee privacy itself.
-------------------------
data
Great, but really needs auto save or confirm on exit.  So many times I start filling out a secure note or manually enter login information, click out to copy something else to paste in, the Plugin window closes and all data entered is lost.

Simple:

Open the Bitwarden site, sign in
Your account is displayed after you sign in.
A menu  is displayed on the top with the option 'Tools' available. Select it to go to the Tools menu then Select the  'Import Data'  option on the left side of the Tools Page.
It will take you to the: 'https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/tools/import' page.
Here you choose the "Select the format of the import file"
A dropdown will exists where you select ' Lastpass csv' as the file to be imported
After you have selected the format you can move on the second option and 'Select the import file", choose the 'Chose File' button, and browse for the file and select it.
Last, choose the 'Import Data' button and wait a moment while will import the :Lastpass file and your done; I had a little over 6,000 site data to be imported and it completed in under a minute with a 2016 Intel i7/ class processor

Can't give a rating yet, downloaded it moments ago.  BUT is DOES concern me that when I go to the website, Chrome says 
This site can’t provide a secure connection
bitwarden.com uses an unsupported protocol.
ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH
HIDE DETAILS
Unsupported protocol
The client and server don't support a common SSL protocol version or cipher suite. This is likely to be caused when the server needs RC4, which is no longer considered secure.

If simply going to their website (for support or even just to look around) is prohibited as "unsupported protocol" then I am to trust my data to it?  

Chrome is VERY annoying with this error message, trying to FORCE all websites to some standard.  I am not a programmer and don't know what it all means, but I am really sick of Chrome.  And now this?  What does it all mean?
-------------------------
encrypt
Normally when you're talking to a website, you are not going directly to an application but to a web server such as apache, which negotiates all elements of encryption on behalf of something like bitwarden, which the web server sees as an application.  The application itself isn't responsible for the encryption protocols, which are handled on its behalf by the web server.

Doubly true of bitwarden.com as its public access is handled thru Cloudflare, a company I know of as I work with a customer of theirs, and I'm familiar with their reputation.  What your browser talks to when you go to connect with https://bitwarden.com is a Cloudflare server, which negotiates the connection then proxies between you and Bitwarden.  So your browser isn't seeing the bitwarden application directly, or even the web server Bitwarden runs.  Instead your browser sees the Cloudflare webserver.

Cloudflare is a technically very sophisticated company, and absolutely on top of their game.  However, it is possible they do not accept connections under older protocols now considered insecure.  If you are running a very old version of Chrome it is possible your Chrome does not support any protocol supported by Cloudflare.

I'm running Google Chrome 78.0 which reports no problem when I browse to https://bitwarden.com.  What version Chrome are you running?

Even if you are running newer chrome, if you are behind a firewall which itself tries to proxy https connections, it is possible the protocols the firewall offers don't include any Cloudflare will honor.  This is unlikely if you are behind a home firewall.  Much more common behind corporate firewalls.  It would need a fairly old or out-of-date firewall to cause this problem.

You might try browsing directly to https://cloudflare.com to see if you can get a connection there.

Lets go back in time, I was using same password for all websites , some time later I started using different password for all websites as it was hard to remember all password I tend to use simple non-secure mostly used passwords , then started to use some password managers and I couldn't sleep at night in a fear that some random password manager company has access to all my passwords. Then bitwarden came to save my digital life and now I have some random 64 letter long password different for all my websites and I can sleep knowing that it is an open source and encrypted even Bitwarden cant access my data. 5 stars are not enough for this wonderful app.

Hey Robbie,
Unfortunately not. Using lock options mean that your encryption key (master password) is only stored in memory with the browser session. If you close the browser that memory is lost, requiring you to enter it back in again.

The Browser extension Biometric Authentication companion, needs some updates so they actually perform as expected. Or once I unlock the the desktop app the browser extension apps should also by default.
Now the review for everyone else....
I have used so, SO, SO, many of these types of Password Vaults, (as I am sure most of you have too!) Including Lastpass, NordPass, Norton, Keeper, all of the browser based ones. I used the free version for a full month(which is more than enough for the normal person) While the app is not as pretty as the others, the price tag you can not argue with. Oh yeah and it doesn't save your info like 
Lastpass was doing a while back.  and being able to install it on multiple devices as well as still being able to sign into the web site and see it online yup, without hesitation it was one of the first times I ever bought an app that fast for personal use without making the company pay for it.
-------------------------
slow
After tons of research and getting so tired of having other similar systmes (Lastpass) getting worse at every update and askign for payment for every feature, I chose bitwarden!

Worked for a month. first upgrade broke the thing. It is now dead slow and keeps locking, so I need to reenter the master password 20 times a day. Not worth it, I think I am going to go back to the post it option. While not secure, at least I do not have to spend days troubleshooting something that is supposed to save time.
I do not know how they have no QA service to test this stuff before releasing updates. and with no way to downgrade, I give up, let me remove this thing from Chrome on all my devices. What a waste of time. A password manager basic functions should be simple. How do they manage to break the most basic functions of the app at every update?
-------------------------
cpu
The last update broke lots of settings. Vault timeout does not respect user setting, high cpu usage from autofill
-------------------------

Was working great until v1.56 ... now it hangs, using 100% CPU time, and gets disabled by Chrome. Have uninstalled, reinstalled, Synced Vault, logged out, logged in. Nothing seems to make a difference.
Please figure out what this bug is and fix it .....

After latest update nothing works as it used to. Autofill spikes CPU load and does not work at all

First time using a password manager app and Bitwarden has made my introduction simple and fast.

In the past I would keep my passwords written on a piece of paper and tuck it away for safe keeping. Well, who knows where that safe keeping spot is. I don't. 

With Bitwarden not only on my PC but my phone too, the stress of having to remember so many different passwords is gone. Thank you Bitwarden!!

Bitwarden is light, so it works all the time, Lastpass has a fancy UI and features but it's buggy and pple never stop complaining. Scroll on these reviews, and try to see how many negative reviews you can see. Get on Lastpass and see the number of complains. Have used Bitwarden for more than two years now and it has never failed even once, it always works, always. May be this is how a password manager should be, light and works all the time, make it fancy, you'll bloat it, and you'll always have bugs and endless complains.

Please separate the password selection page and the management page. The extension is slow to open now（I have 471 items）, it takes up a lot of memory, and the performance is low.

I was a long time personal @1password user but have been more and more frustrated over the years as they pivoted their business model to SaaS based. All the legacy tech is a burden. Their new stuff is great but it's expensive. BitWarden has been a great free replacement on many of my personal devices. The only thing I don't like is how slow the extensions load but I assume that will be fixed soon.

lite
Mycket bra lösenordshanterare. Jag har bytt från lastpass efter deras 100% smyghöjning av priset. Enkel och använda. Den hittar alla inskrivbara fält (som jag stött på hittills efter att ha använt den i en månad eller så) och fyller dem säkert utan problem. Webläsartillägget tar automatiskt fram lösenordet för den sida man är på (eller om man har fler konton tar den fram alla och man bara klickar på den man vill så fylls användarnamn och lösenord i. 
Har naturligtvis stöd för att fylla i kreditkortsnummer också.

Man måste inte ha webläsartillägget egentligen då man kan logga in på ens personliga lösenordsvalv på en websida, vilket är bra när man ute och reser, men webläsartillägget gör allting så mycket smidigare. Den har även "form filler" vilket gör att den kan fylla i allt som behövs vad gäller namn, adress, telefonnummer, mailadress osv. på nätformulär. Bitwarden gör livet mycket bekvämare, förutom det självklara med att alla lösenord är skyddade. 

Man kan om man är lite "händig" även välja att själv styra över databasfilen och ha den på egen server om man väljer att inte lita på deras server. Vilket är konstigt att inte göra kan jag tycka då själva säkerheten sitter i lösenordet för att kunna öppna databasfilen, inte var databasen finns. Finns till mobiler också och allt synkas. Fristående program på väg också. 

Att den är gratis gör ju inte saken sämre, men jag väljer att betala den knappa hundringen per år för att stödja utvecklingen.
-------------------------
lite
Måste ändra lite i recensionen. Har märkt att - ibland - fyller den inte formulär eller kreditkortsinformation automatiskt har jag upptäckt nu. Det kan bero på att, som utvecklaren svarat mig, att de ännu inte stöder "backup detection for the swedish language yet". Men det är ett program under utveckling så de fixar det nog. Alla logins funkar dock precis som de ska.

Recent update is nice.  I like the auto add feature.  Performance is still slow for me, 2-3 seconds to load during left click.  Would also like option to hide login username from vault view.

It's very effective at blocking unwanted or dangerous stuff from running on sites you go to. Just whitelist the site you're on if it's something you use often and know is safe.

However, it doesn't work well at all with sites that put a username in front of the domain. Bandcamp and Itch.io are two examples. 

For instance, www.bandname1.bandcamp.com and www.bandname2.bandcamp.com would have to be added separately. So every single band at Bandcamp has to be whitelisted individually, you can't just whitelist a site like Bandcamp once and be done with it. 

Any site which puts a username in front of the domain has this problem, and it's the most frustrating thing about the extension if you happen to use any sites which do that. Otherwise this would have been a 5 star review. 

I even tried contacting the developer about this some time ago but never got a response.

What makes it worse is that every single other security focused extension I have used, except for this one, makes it easy to whitelist an entire site domain even if the site puts a username in front of the domain. It's ONLY this one that can't let you whitelist all of a site like of Bandcamp or Itch.io with just one click. Only this one.

It also doesn't seem to have any way to export/import settings at all, which is what prompted this review. I was going to recommend this extension to someone who doesn't use Bandcamp or Itch.io, and export my over 3000 long whitelist so they could use it. But there's no export/import anywhere that I can see. There's no way I'd want them to go through the trouble of adding all those themselves, like I did slowly over years, so I guess I won't be recommending it to them after all. 

Honestly if I had known about the username.domain issue before I had a very sizable whitelist already, I would never have started using this in the first place.

Blocks scripts based on the URL, so there is no way to allow some scripts and block others from the same page. Does not show what is/isn't being blocked, so if one page is dependent on scripts from another URL, you have no way of knowing what to unblock except to open the inspector, dig around for failed requests, open their URLs, then allow them with the menu. Incredibly tedious and basically unusable for all but the most basic use-cases.

This review is hard to understand, but if I do, it's such a singular use-case that IMHO it hardly warrants a one-star rating on its own. I mean, really, how many websites pass passwords to back-end scripts via JavaScript anyway? One in a million, maybe? Security-wise, I'm not sure but it doesn't even sound like a good practice anyway, and probably *should* be blocked. Besides and regardless, if you're not allowing/whitelisting the basic JS code a site needs to perform its primary purpose (such as authenticating a visitor), then you probably aren't even using the extension properly.

Just too many small issues to count.

It may be that I don't understand the features of the extension well enough, but that's not for lack of looking.

It would be nice to temporarily whitelist the current site and everything it needs to connect to.  I have no idea if that's possible.

It would be nice to be able to blacklist hosts that the current page has loaded from.  I don't know if that's possible.

Too many pages end up in a broken state with no obvious reason as to what has been blocked (if anything) that is causing the breakage.

Its useless because i only want to block a few sites.
-------------------------
list
White list doesn't work, so you either block everything or nothing. Uninstalled.
-------------------------
whitelist
Doesn't appear to recognise any valid catch-all regexp put into the blacklist - scripts are still running on pages.

Also tends to forget settings from time to time when running in whitelist mode.
-------------------------
whitelist
The UI is unintuitive and does not lend itself to easily whitelisting a site domain or editing existing whitelists.
-------------------------
list
Just too many small issues to count.

It may be that I don't understand the features of the extension well enough, but that's not for lack of looking.

It would be nice to get a list of all hosts that have been blocked on the current page.  I have no idea how to get that.

It would be nice to temporarily whitelist the current site and everything it needs to connect to.  I have no idea if that's possible.

It would be nice to be able to blacklist hosts that the current page has loaded from.  I don't know if that's possible.

Too many pages end up in a broken state with no obvious reason as to what has been blocked (if anything) that is causing the breakage.
-------------------------
whitelist
Every time it updates the whitelist gets deleted, forcing me to start all over with the whitelisting process - after this much time the problem should have been addressed...
-------------------------
whitelist
After every update it clears all my whitelisted urls and now with this latest update you have swapped the Add and Settings button ruining the usefulness of my muscle memory needlessly.

javascript
This review is hard to understand, but if I do, it's such a singular use-case that IMHO it hardly warrants a one-star rating on its own. I mean, really, how many websites pass passwords to back-end scripts via JavaScript anyway? One in a million, maybe? Security-wise, I'm not sure but it doesn't even sound like a good practice anyway, and probably *should* be blocked. Besides and regardless, if you're not allowing/whitelisting the basic JS code a site needs to perform its primary purpose (such as authenticating a visitor), then you probably aren't even using the extension properly.

i could not figure out how to use this extenion. it either breaks everything in a webpage or does nothing it all in addition it block all scripts, theres no concievable way i can see to allow certain scripts to run and block the ones you do not want that are the cause of some website annoyance, all in all i found no script suite lite to have a convoluted UI and no meaningful uses.

You complaining that it "Breaks most sites" would be like complaining that hammers are useless because you keep breaking your windows with it.. You know, maybe you shouldn't use a hammer to clean your windows! lol

Seriously, NoScript is not the kind of extension that you just do a quick installation and forget about it. First of all, you need to configure it depending on what level of protection you want to get and you can also add custom protections for some very specific websites.

IMHO, if you are not tech-savvy you shouldn't use NoScript. Instead, if you want to have a better protection for your security and/or privacy, maybe use something like "HTTPS Everywhere" and an easy-to-use ad-blocker like "uBlock Origin" or "Ghostery". Ad-Blockers are not only used for blocking ads, generally they will also block other things like dangerous scripts and websites. There is also a lot of tutorials that can help you get a better configuration for your browser.

If you don't understand how to use something then try learning to use it or just don't use it at all... and stop complaining about it!

I install it to block js stuff from google. Apparently everything from google is listed as trusted and I cannot untick the script for trusted pages. great.
-------------------------
block
A great extension for blocking scripts
-------------------------
block
Even with everything enabled, the entire internet is blocked right now. Not even google will load despite all of the scripts being allowed.
-------------------------
block
For some reason I have to completely remove NoScripts to be able to do anything on the web. It has the little blue plus sign that means there is a top level site that is being blocked and it won't allow it to be unblocked. Likely happened in an update around an hour ago with how many reviews are talking about it
-------------------------
block
As of today No Script is suddenly blocking elements of nearly all the webpages people would use. That includes normal things like using a search engine (e.g. duckduckgo) or using youtube. Could the Devs look into this? It's making normal browsing a bit difficult if everything is blocked.
-------------------------
block
This. Can't even login to some places because some elements are blocked. I had to turn off noscript just to login to make this comment as it wasn't letting me. It's blocking youtube, google, and a heap of other websites as of now for me.
-------------------------
block
its blocking youtube right now for some reason
-------------------------

I've noticed this as well, its blocking nearly everything for me I've had to disable it in my extensions for now because I can't do anything otherwise.
-------------------------
block
It's great at blocking scripts and other privacy invasive elements, and does it's job well. That being said, the new window popout every time you click to change what you allow and disallow is incredibly annoying. There's no reason to have a popout like that every time, as most sites don't require that to change extension settings. A simple time delay on the new window popout would rectify this issue entirely.
-------------------------
block
its a little confusing to use. frankly it would be nice if it could highlight known ad and spam engines so i don't accidentally check them off. 

there is no way to contact them other than to figure out their confusing forum. 

when i click it and i get the trust this or that window, a second window always pops up and i have to close it manually. its a bug, but no way to report it. 

i like having the ability to block things, but without knowing what i'm blocking, what those links are, what might be safe or not, its often hard to use.
-------------------------
block
That's akin to trying to block all vegetables from your life, and then commenting that it's troublesome that you have to selectively allow cucumbers and lettuces to get past the restriction. That's the whole point of this extension so it's not ridiculous at all.

If you were only allowed to add one extension to you browser. NoScript would be the smartest choice.      Knowledge is half the battle and controlling is the rest. You decide what a web page loads period.

There has been no better security extension for Firefox and I've used it for years. Now, after years of pleading, it's available for Chrome and it's about as identical as you could wish for! The only missing feature I've found so far is XSS blocking, but I bet we'll see that soon.

Good in principle, poor execution and options. Breaks most sites, can't spend a lifetime in manually whitelisting and figuring out which places work and which won't. It's mostly hit-or-miss on a large number of sites. 

Ideally there should be a blacklist of most used sites (from google to fb, twitter, amazon, youtube, yahoo, wikipedia, and so on sites) so that users could pick up crowd-created settings shared via options selection where a user could load and apply such shared settings or choose to create and use its own. Obviously that would require the extension to have a more granular control over what is allowed and what is filtered out. Until then it's not very useful IMHO... certainly not to me. Since it's not feasible nor practical in any way to use it I ended up uninstalling it rather quickly after testing it across a few major sites: 8 for effort, 5 for execution, 2 for support.

access
For the most part this extension is amazing, I've used it for months with only minor issues (namely just being minor annoyances not even really linked to the extension itself, such as what script is causing what to pop up and what are needed for the site to work), but, as it appears a lot of people started noting around February 3rd, the extension started having some... issues. Now, for me, the most prevalent was just that it forgot what was trusted, which was small inconvenience that was relatively easy to fix, if not just a bit annoying. HOWEVER, as of today, August 7th 2022, the extension seems to have completely broken on my pc. This could easily be an issue on my side and somethings gone wrong with my computer or connection, but given the similar accounts given by others on this page, I believe it to be an issue with NoScript itself. I cannot access any sites and had to turn the entire extension off just to load a single page correctly. Hopefully whatever issue is causing this will be fixed in the near future, because as I said, this is a great extension. It just seems to be a bit broken right now.

I ran in the same issue. You need to install it "manually" by downloading the "RC for chrome" (is a ZIP file) and install it using the developer mode in the Chrome extensions page (Load unpacked). And now it works!

Hi,
I'm on macOS - Chrome version 79.0 - NoScript version 11.0.10.
Since updating to current NoScript version (11.0.10) something strange happened, I keep getting the following message "In order to operate on this tab, NoScript needs to reload it. Proceed?" whenever I try to open the selection tab, on websites where I do not authorize use of cookies. If authorize cookies, NoScript would work just fine, and show the selection tab. Before updating, NoScript worked independently of cookie permission.

Can someone pls explain why, since last update, I must authorize cookies for NoScript to work ? That is not how a Scriptblocker is supposed to work.

Stellar until this week.

Updated Chrome to version 80, updated NoScript to 11.10
Now, right-click on NS button will not open the NS  permissions window -

Any ideas?
