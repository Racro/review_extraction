It's sooo good as it blocks every ads 100% recommend this!!!
-------------------------

Best ad blocker out here! You can even decide what gets blocked and what doesn't. 
Haven't had a single problem with it. Don't believe me? Try it, you wont be disappointed.
-------------------------
block
Extremely useful, I recommend.
Of course no adblocker can block everything but this one does a fantastic job
-------------------------
block
so much good for any ad blocking
-------------------------
block
Very good Extension, it works very well in blocking ads on websites.
-------------------------
prevent
I had no idea that an ad blocker would prevent reCaptcha notices.  It allows me to stay human.
-------------------------
block
allows you to even block those stupid ads that pop up after the page loads so that most adblocks cant block it. also you can break websites by blocking random elements/cookies and i think thats very funny
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus has been very effective in blocking advertising and websties. On occasion a website comes up that I don't want blocked and it is easy to unblock those websites.
-------------------------
block
EASILY the best ad-blocker I've ever found. Wanna block a specific element you don't like on a page? The feature to do so is readily available, just a few clicks, then bam, you have access to block anything possible. Wanna stop ad-blocking because you want to give a few cents to a kind stranger? Done, with nothing but a click within the menu. I definitely recommend getting it, because it not only works incredibly well, but others have mentioned how they've been using it for years without a problem in other reviews, and I've found proof of that firsthand. Not a single ad, no weirdness, nothing; it's genuinely near flawless. Easiest 10/10 of my LIFE.

Edit: yeah, I was right, I just didn't know how right I was. For any who somehow stumble across this review, if you have something like those premium subscription pop-ups that sometimes slip through, you can block those as well using the built-in feature. Just click the block option in the menu that pops up when you click on the extension next to the search bar at the top, and hover over what you want to block, then move the mouse around the general area until it highlights the full part of what you want to block, including its background. If you're having trouble going back to the normal page and you have been blocked from interacting with it, then you can open a new tab (or duplicate it), reload your current one, or press the back button. There's also an option to un-block something in the settings if you wish to do so, although you can just fully disable ad blocking for the specific page you're on within that same menu that you used earlier.

Superb extension I have complete trust in it. It gets on with the job without any fuss and protects you from the annoying interruptions

Blocks all ads. If anything slips through, you can just click block element. Its free, its reliable, its Adblock Plus. Ive been using it for a long time, and it is probably the best extension I have. Its crucial for any pc.
-------------------------

200,932 ads blocked on my pc alone and rising. Numbers don't lie. Bravo!
-------------------------

I been using ABP for years now, fantastic product. Over 1.6 million ads blocked, amazing.

I also donate 1 - 2 times per year to help keep them going, huge value.
-------------------------
block
Have been using it forever, no problems ever, and it block YouTube ads as well. Thanks!!
-------------------------
block
Work exactly as you want with decent level of customization and blocking elements on demand. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
very good.. ABP blocks adds that were not effectively blocked by AB
-------------------------
block
This program used to be so much better. There's a lot more websites that still have ads that can't be blocked.
-------------------------
block
blocks all of annoying ads!
-------------------------
block
Absolutely wonderful.  Have been using for a while-and very pleased.  Was just on a webpage and noticed it had blocked 1217 just while I was on that page.  Yeah...ABP
-------------------------
block
nice extension for blocking ads my personal favourite
-------------------------
block
Helped me block 585 ad on a page
-------------------------
block
It blocks every single ad from existence. Definitely download this if you hate ads.
-------------------------
block
Perfect for blocking elements containing Marxist propaganda.
-------------------------
block
I hadn't had much of a problem with ads until recently.  I'm not sure why but ads started blocking just half of an article I was reading from a legitimate site. One of the features I like best about AdBlock Plus is that it will allow you to list the sites you like and it won't block them. Prior to buying AdBlock Plus, I had subscrrbed to a much more expensive blocking service that would do the same but it was a much more involved process. With AdBlock Pus, it's so easy.

I tried AdBlock first and liked it sii I switched to AdBlock Plus for its added benefits.  I think it's nice to  buy a service like AdBlock Plus that allows you to contribute the amount of money you think it's worth, without charging you a set amount. I figure I got added benefits that AdBlock didn't have and I'm helping the company to keep the free site available for others, while I get added features.  I really love AdBlock Plus and I highly recommend it to others!
-------------------------
block
Very good, love that you can select an element and block it, not perfect since it's free, but with the custom element blocker it works great, it's free so definitely worth it.
-------------------------
block
Great Job blocking all of those ad's really had me thinking I was crazy
-------------------------
block
use to be the best but now your lucky if it blocks a pop up
-------------------------
block
Pretty good. No complaints. Even blocks ads on YouTube. Nice go, ABP.
-------------------------
block
Love it!! could you make it so that it blocks ads on spotify? Thanks!!
-------------------------
block
Awesome extension. It can block almost all ads except a few items but user can hide those exceptional ads manually. So I think it's okay. 
It's the best ad blocker as I used before.
-------------------------
block
This adblocker is very useful.While searching the web and such, or just watching stuff, ad's are a breeze with ABP. If you can't get Opera Gx, then I recommend ABP, as it blocks all the annoying lil' ads you might or might not see.
-------------------------
block
very good at blocking ads
-------------------------
block
This extension is not working. It didn't block a SINGLE ad on YouTube. I finally found one that works. If you're looking for an adblocker that actually works, try this one: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblocker-for-yt/ldbflapfegfcoipoeophhjbgfcllmjip
-------------------------

lol, ad block plus now has recurring ad block plus ads that open a new tab asking for money even though you already paid.
-------------------------
block
good ad block ngl
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus blocks almost all the adds and gives us a true add free experience. I am loving this adblocker.
-------------------------
block
Thanks for this tool. blocks all adds
-------------------------
block
I am using it from around last one year and it blocks every pop-ups every ads(Hotstar,mx player,youtube etc) and with this I never have to waste my time by watching ads
-------------------------
block
The extension works well and blocked total of 50,566 ads inn a span of 1 year I think. But I do believe it used to be better in terms of not getting many ads. Now I do get ads on websites but I really do appreciate this extension very much so I gave it a good 4 stars.
-------------------------
block
i love this extension so much, im so happy that now i get to watch the videos i want to without seeing ads, i have 113 ads that have been blocked and im so surprised how many were in store for me, but props to you guys for doing that, i cant afford premium right now so i feel like i have premium by using this app, thanks so much
-------------------------
block
No ads, really it works, just tweak the extension settings to block all ads, else some ads will still be shown, this is important.
It even blocks ads on every YouTube video, it's a life saver. Greatest extention period.
Thanks for reading.
-------------------------
protect
my browser is more protected than my parents' sex
-------------------------
block
Works really well at blocking the vast majority of ads. When watching YouTube it can be a little buggy but and slow down it a bit, but it is overall faster than no ad block. Do recommend.
-------------------------
block
best ad blocker i love it, it even blocks youtube adds, so premium without premium.
-------------------------
block
Great for blocking those so annoying ads. Keep up the great work.
-------------------------
block
A great assist for blocking trash. Thank you so much.
-------------------------
block
Great app, works efficiently and out of sight, easy to cancel blocking for certain sites and pages.
-------------------------
block
ABP got the blocks on lockdown. Extremely useful for Youtube specifically, no ads at all when viewing. That's really the extent of my use, but most other sights I'm not seeing ads on.
Also love that you can turn it on and off pretty fast. Needed to once and it wasn't confusing. 
-Great extension 10/10.
-------------------------
block
Blocks 95% of ads
-------------------------
block
Been using this for years! It's always been reliable, effective and non-intrusive. Even blocks YT ads 🙌🏾
-------------------------
block
This is epic. it blocks all the annoying ads especially on youtube.
-------------------------
block
It used to be very good. Even after donating and paying they keeping bugging you to pay again and they want a review and constantly bug for that every time it loads on a new page.
It does a good job of blocking ads.
-------------------------
protect
This is freaking amaizing it helps you protect yourself and stops all those 2 ads before a youtube video. while i have seen some ads on sites that show evan with this on it is amaizing and usualy things this good would need you to pay for them.
-------------------------
block
This worked great and blocked all ads from my computer would recommend 100%
-------------------------

this extension literally every time i watch a Youtube video it blocks every ad this is amazing!😀
-------------------------
protect
protects from viruses somtimes and false advretisments too really good extention would recommend

Best free chrome pop-up blocker

So far the most reliable app you can use to block all pop ups.
Best thing is it's absolutely free. Highly recommended. Go for it guys.
-------------------------
block
ABP is fantastic! It saved me from constantly seeing flashy images and useless ads! I hope the developers are getting their well deserved admiration for creating this product (by the way has been adding other blocking extensions - and no one worked so perfect as ABP!) At least from me they get   grateful applause! Thanks!

Cant live without, best add block extenwion ever

BLOCKS ADS
-------------------------

Great extension, Blocked all adds and quick in playing videos, blocks pop-ups and is very nice extension and does not take too space and blocks malware from attacking computers.
-------------------------
detect
I wish it could by pass websites abilities to detect adblockers and force you to turn them off. Otherwise it does a great job keeping the noise of a page down!
-------------------------
block
its amazing for blocking unnecessary ads on websites
-------------------------
block
cracked bro blocks everything
-------------------------
block
Very helpful and blocks all the ads, youtube premium is worthless now
-------------------------

THE BEST,
especially the previewing feature the show how things gonna be before blocking the element.
-------------------------
block
Definitely works! Its blocks like ROBLOX ads on the website and when your going looking at stuff like websites it really helps so you don't get viruses and scams. Best Ad Blocker. I've had it for over 1 year now :D
-------------------------
block
Amazing!! I can block all those annoying add, even on Youtube
-------------------------

best app for blocking youtube ads
-------------------------
block
Best for blocking ads .... I loved it.
-------------------------
block
Very good at blocking the ads
-------------------------
block
It blocks every add that there is, except on aps that you can't use ad blockers, but its great
-------------------------
block
I have used this for two years at least.  Does what is says it will.  Development is consistent and frequent.  Occasionally there is a CPU hit, it gets resolved.  Very rarely there is an ad it does not catch, when reported and then blocked it usually solves this. Whitelisting sites or just pages is easy.  Thanks ABP!
-------------------------
block
it does what it says it will and it does it rather well in my opinion and at no cost to me so five star from me! 10/10 I definitely recommend though I will say while it does block ads some websites have software to see if you are using an adblocker and will stop you from using it till you deactivate the ad blocker not to criticize adblock it's free and does as promised.
-------------------------
block
Free app, runs smoothly in the background and blocks apps nearly everywhere.
-------------------------
block
blocks add most of the time

Loved it very much and block element feature is just amazaing! :D

-------------------------

hands down one of the best ad blockers!!!!!!!! I use typing.com to do typing lessons in one of my classes, and in the background ads refresh every few seconds. With ABP, I am able to block ads, and also block page elements. very helpful adblocker, 10/10 :D
-------------------------
block
Good extension for ad blocking, but need bit more accuracy.
-------------------------
block
I'm impressed by not only the reliability of ABP blocking ads everyday, but also its ability of 'blocking page elements' flawlessly, not mentioning it's totally free! What a marvel!
-------------------------
block
Its really good, Blocks every add, Except for some popups in the corner of my screen, If it blocked pop ups it would be 5/5 stars
-------------------------
block
Its so good at blocking ads and it's easy to use!
-------------------------
block
i love this adblocker
ive blocked around 1.5 million ads so far and this has helped tremendously when downloading files, watching content on sites, and so much more
thank you for this amazing ad blocker
-------------------------
block
Bye bye stupid ads! No more video ads or 'acceptable' ads! ABP has blocked so many annoying ads that I don't ever want to see again.

A tip: Turn on the Anti Adblock Block filter in Settings and teach the money-hungry websites a lesson by disabling their "disable your adblocker" pop-ups!
-------------------------
block
Awesome website for ad blocking...
-------------------------
block
Good adblocker. Except it also blocks the honey chrome extension. If it can be fixed it's 5 star
-------------------------
block
ABP is doing a pretty good job blocking unwanted and annoying adds.
-------------------------
block
I love this I have used it for 2 years now and have blocked 2000 ads. This is the best add blocker.
-------------------------
block
This app works great. I like the way you can turn off blocking for just one page. Sites to block are continually  updated within the app. The allow site feature get automatically populated when you turn off blocking to a particular site or page and the list is easy find in settings if you need to change or remove a site. Advanced features include the ability to create your own or import custom access or blocking filters/lists. You can even force an update to or edit the built in filters/lists
-------------------------
block
its good for blocking ads pop ups and other things
-------------------------
detect
Idea: Maybe add a feature where when websites detect an adblocker and tell you to turn it off. Maybe add a feature where those websites cant detect it? Just a suggestion, if you like it contact me at, Ultimateflexer123456@gmail.com THANKS love it btw
-------------------------
block
I've been using this app for a couple of years on my Chromebook and it is a GREAT tool for helping to reduce pesky ads on many sites. It's not that I mind having ads, but constantly having to close those that block the content, or having to scroll past several ads to see the content, becomes exasperating. I highly recommend it!
-------------------------
block
Overall, it's a good extension. It effectively blocks pop-up and youtube ads, but i wish it blocked ads on spotify better.
-------------------------
block
it's just useful and does block every annoying ad / Pop-ups !
-------------------------
block
it works very well, and blocks ads on anime sites like 9anime and stuff, but it says it blocks youtube ads, which it does not do smh. overall a really good adblocker, 10/10 would recomment
-------------------------
block
Works great. Been using it for 3 years, still no problems. Blocks YouTube ads too, so no more sitting through ads. Really effective. Wish I could rate it more than 5 stars!
-------------------------
block
Works quite well. I've used quite a few adblockers. This one is simple & effective. I like how it allows me to preview the website with the ad blocked before I actually block it. Thank you again for your helpful extension.
-------------------------
block
Good. Works perfectly, but I would like to be able to just block pop-ups or something like that.
-------------------------
block
This ABP app is great, No interuptions when i am online doing my thing etc.
And blocks out garbage that i don't need to see or read about!.
-------------------------
block
This blocks all of the adds you can find.
-------------------------
block
I really liked it, but what im asking for is to block pop-ups, afterall though..great work.. The fact that its free has suprised me a lot.
-------------------------
block
I love this adblocker, it blocks every single ad and I mean EVERY single ad and its so convenient and I love using it, its like gaining a passive ability for your browser but its a prestige ability. :D
-------------------------
block
Completely amazing. Not a single add since I have installed it. Especially as I go on YouTube often, I haven't had to deal with 3 adds in a row. Does not mess up my laptop at all and I would highly recommend. Its blocked over 13 thousand adds which is incredible.
-------------------------
block
It really helped me in a lot of cases plus the advanced blocking options are recommended. It sometimes crashed itself but not chrome. I recommend it.
-------------------------
block
Great app, works pretty, and blocks most ads, there might be 1 or 2 ads on a couple select websites that slip through the cracks, but overall a great service.
-------------------------
block
blocked everything from popups to yt ads! very good
-------------------------
block
Blocks most things instantly, and the windows that do go through get blocked almost instantly after they show up, great app!
-------------------------
block
It is THE BEST ad block extension available. It not only blocks all the ads and but also also pop-up ads. It works like a charm on anime and manga websites. Thank you for recomending me this extension.
-------------------------
block
This is truly the best adblock I have ever used. It has already blocked about 10,000 ads for me. It is completely free, no watermark or premium. Not like other pay to use adblocks. Devs did a great job. Thanks everyone who made this. Also, one thing, the "Adblock for Youtube™" (please dont send hate to it) has a watermark. But adblock plus, best ever! Really recommend Adblock plus.
-------------------------
block
Nice web extension, it can actually block intrusive ads and unnecessary ads.

though it rarely block redirect ads that is so annoying, I wish the devs fix this. ty.

Essential for a pleasant web browsing experience and one of the first extensions you should install when starting with a fresh browser, the other one which comes to mind is Crumbs which protects your privacy.

best  for ad blocking  in browser
-------------------------
block
The best extension in chrome will be this 
Soo helpful
I am a student and in this pandemic I would always be sharing  YT videos  with students and teachers and a Baby Diaper Ad would just come and be unskippable And I would be furious 
After I found The Concept of  Adblockers I Tried A bunch but wasn't satisfied  but after i found this I love this and it always helps 
I would recommend this AdBlocker if you want to Block  some Nasty Ads
-------------------------
block
Add Blocker Plus works great. Without issue it blocks unwanted adds. Since installing it I don't see adds I don't want to see or need. Great  product at the right price.
-------------------------
block
This ad block extension amazing , it blocks all of my YouTube ads this is the highest rated ad blocker available for free on the chrome store
-------------------------
block
Simply the best addon on the store, a literal life changer. You won't appreciate how much time & sanity it saves you until logging into a public or friend's PC later on and seeing all the repulsive, dehumanizing litter that are web ads. It isn't designed to block cookies and the like so if you want to go full in on blocking those an alternative browser altogether is your best bet. As for this, it's insane that it's both this effective and this free. They never intrusively ask but you can donate to them, highly recommend. Peace of mind is priceless
-------------------------
block
Works really well.  I only wish the 'block element' feature worked better when trying to view news articles that show the 'disable ad blocker' overlay.
-------------------------
block
it really blocked my 1000 of ads. very much productive
-------------------------
block
Man! i love it, i'd use this extension for couple months and it really blocked all ads
-------------------------
block
I absolutely love this product. If something isn't blocked, you can use Adblock Plus to block elements on a per page basis. I think this makes the software incredibly powerful. Most of the time it just works out of the box. I would recommend this product many times over!
-------------------------
block
its completely work for real i can also block some ads that were not block too
-------------------------
block
Good stuff can block utube ads
-------------------------
block
Awesome extension that cut down on a lot of unnecessary ads... can also choose to have ads or no ads at all by turning off the ad blocker and refreshing the page. Saved me from lots of ugly ads blocking the page. Highly highly recommend! Works great on chrome, might slow down some processes a little (not tested but highly suspect) but overall good for daily usage.

Great browser extension, extremely easy to set up upon first use using the settings that are web-based basically on a web page and to configure everything on the first run - thankfully when I bought a used Google Chromebook from Acer, once I sign into Gmail slash Google, Adblock Plus was pulled in from my I guess Windows 10 desktop PC and other places I was happy to not have to go download this again. It's a little confusing that there's an ad block I guess basic, and Adblock Plus, and I think there's an Adblock Pro which is maybe a subscription or annual payment model - hopefully this is not the freemium model or bait and switch Etc. Very pleased with configuring settings and letting be browser extension hideout in the background nice and quietly. Kudos 5 of 5 stars!
-------------------------

Does the job and blocks the ad.

-------------------------

Have always used Adblock on all my devices and have never had any issues with it. It is so easy to use and is free so what's not to love? This is always the first extension I ad to my new computers. Plus I always recommend it to friends due to it being such a reliable ad blocking service. I personally have never had any issues with it slowing down my pc in any way.
-------------------------
block
I've been using this for 2 or 3 years from a discord friend. It blocks YouTube, ROBLOX, websites to watch things on, ect. The settings can be changed to your liking too.
-------------------------

Best for blocking redirection, but does not work for pop ups.
Anyways, thanks!
-------------------------

AMAZING. Blocks all ads if you turn off allow acceptable ads and... finally.. what I've been looking for.

I have been happy with Ad Block and especially like the whitelist feature.

Best adblocker ive ever had. no signup, works on 99.99% websites and even shows the number of adds blocked, you can turn it off and on and it even has a block feature. 10/10 would reccomend

I've been using adblock plus since 2014 and they've been awesome. Only a few months in between 2014 to now has adblock plus not block intrusive ads. Mostly around election season. But for the most part, adblock plus is a 10/10!

BEST THING EVER! THIS WILL LITERALLY SAVE YOUR LIFE. I have used this for 2 ish years and it blocks EVERY. ADD. IN. EXISTENCE. not just youtube, but while your watching movies, and every website, like if your playing games, etc. Its completely safe, and for me it doesn't up that much space, it  is literally the best thing in the world!!!
-------------------------

This is a very good Adblocker that I came across. Blocks almost every annoying ad. I can watch Youtube without any full screen ads. Love it!
-------------------------
block
Great software for blocking adverts i give it a 10/10 even though it may not block twitch adverts (because amazon is greedy) it has blocked over 5000 ads in the last 2 weeks
-------------------------
block
its actually surprisingly pretty good at blocking sudden pop ups especially if you're streaming vids.
-------------------------
block
It blocked Yotube ads and an all sites! I definitely recommend it!
-------------------------

No more frustration from pop-ups, easy to turn off for sites that won't work with ad block apps and continues to block junk from the rest.
-------------------------
block
Amazing! Blocks ads for youtube, roblox and more.
-------------------------

Very good ad blocker. It works on so many sites such as YouTube, Crunchyroll, Funimation, and more. This is also good for virus prevention, especially if using a free movie or show website. Very customizable and still being updated. Thank you Adblock Plus!
-------------------------
block
This adblocker is AMAZING! it blocks pretty much every ad and if one slips thru you always have the "block element tool" so get rid of unwanted ads and other things. 5/5 keep up the good work devs

The best one it blocks everything i love it. i use it for anime

You could be right. Although, it isn't the Ad blocker's fault. YouTube has started using new technology blocking Ad blockers from blocking Ads which happened to me making me look for a new Ad blocker then I cam to this one. Learn more at: https://help.getadblock.com/support/solutions/articles/6000109702-i-m-seeing-ads-in-youtube-videos

Excellent blocking- effortless for me to use. Thanx so much!!! :)
-------------------------

very good , blocking most ads but need a pop-up blocker and update to block ads on Facebook and YouTube
-------------------------
block
very good but doesn't seem to block youtube ads anymore
-------------------------
block
Worked amazing for a good while and was FREE to boot. Now it blocks almost nothing and doesn't give you the opportunity to skip the donation. I got it because it was a free program but now it isn't worth getting and was astounding when used before.
-------------------------
bypass
I have a couple of macbook pros.
i learned not to do updates for safari, because it removed my adblock plus and i could never use it again... i have mojave on one, am not going to update it, and adblock plus is like God to me, living for two years with ads on youtube, now ad free completely...
i find every couple of weeks youtube or google comes out with a new bypass probably a trojan on a video i watch, but i found a way to stop all ads...
all you do is open the adblock plus icon on top of your screen, on CHROME, which I am using, NOT safari, it wont work on safari anymore... but on Chrome, when you install adblock plus, you get a red icon on top of screen. Click on the gear and open settings then on left go to Advanced, and then update your filter lists and you will stop all youtube ads...
ADBLOCK PLUS, i love you, saving me data way out in the bush using my phone... thank you guys you are tops...
-------------------------
block
been using this extension for only a around half a year but its the best I've had, blocks everything on every website, all for free. Couldn't ask for more :)
-------------------------
block
ok so i had the ad blocker on and it didnt block the ads that much. i still got ads
-------------------------
block
Been surfing the web for awhile and had bad experiences with other adblockers, until I finally got this one. blocks everything and if there's a script that bypasses it they have a feature where you can block the element manually and you won't ever see it. I highly recommend this to anyone with a computer and wants a sense of peace when it comes to doing their work or just want to surf the web

This Is The Best Ads Blocker Unlike Other Ad Blockers Who Block Ad After Its Come On YT Its Block Ad Before Its Come Because Of Other Ad Blockers Block After Ad Comes The Video Reload And Other Ad Blocker Doesn't Block YT Ad Until Its Road And Because Of That Feature Of ABP Its Not Wasting My Internet, Thanks Team ABP
-------------------------
block
Quick and easy to install. Blocked well over 160,000 adverts in total so far. Extremely good.
-------------------------

it was brilliant, i really recommend this to everyone. its perfect you can use the "block element" button to black ANYTHING you want on a page, its simply marvelous and it reduces lag on websites. overall i give it a 10/10
-------------------------
block
A must have extension in all the browsers, cool feature is that it can block all types of ads, especially youtube's.
-------------------------
block
more than satisfied. a new kind of orgasm.
this stuff not does only block ads, but it also provides me the tool to kick out whatever i want. in so many different ways.
those 'sign-in- and email-requesting boxes? BAM! disappeared
those features in a specific app, like 'enlarge or minimize the word size'? BAM! vanished!

just literally any visible image appearing in a website possible, you can make it go away, this extension can even block a freight train!
-------------------------
block
Great add-on for my Windows laptop. I've been using ABP for awhile now and have never had any issues with it and blocks all those annoying ads!
-------------------------
block
It's nice, but it doesn't block all adds on reddit. Fix this and I'll go up to 5 stars!
-------------------------
block
Awesome app, works perfectly blocks ads,malware and things that can harm my computer.
REQUEST: Can you maybe add where it blocks ``Please disable your Adblocker'' 
HOW TO DISABLE SITES ASKING YOU DISABLE YOUR ADBLOCKER: Click the lock icon on chrome, now click site settings, scroll down to javascripts, click ``Block'' now reload the page that's asking you to disable it now there you go now site asking for it!

-------------------------
block
very good , if it blocks youtube ads ( video ads ) it will be best ad blocker.
-------------------------
block
Just Perfect. Blocks every ad on every website including Youtube.
-------------------------
block
yes every ad blocker does not block facebook video
-------------------------
block
Works great. very helpful 'Block Element' option
-------------------------
block
works very unnoticeably  and smooth AF and blocks all ads even on youtube without any problem
-------------------------
block
Truly amazing product, it fails to block ads on some sites but overall it is amazing. I wonder how long will this last? Ads ruined the internet.
-------------------------
block
It worked perfect! So far, I've used one website, and on that one website, it's blocked over 2000 pop ups! (gocomics .com)

I use YouTube for language learning and this extension really helps to block annoying adds.
In addition to that I use the following free extension to turn YouTube to a FREE language course :

The best Ad Block program, this will block all ads on facebook, it works on all websites, i been using this program for 3 years, and i also install this on all my clients computers. Everyone seems to love it and always ask me how did you remove those ads this is great. Install this and be free from Ads
-------------------------
block
It blocks all ads. You can even teach it to block ads.
-------------------------
block
Block all the adds
-------------------------
block
awesome works very good
ive used this for a month now and its blocked about 2,000 adds from crunchyrool and youtube i think every laptop/desktop should have abp
-------------------------
block
blocks all youtube ads, very helpful!
-------------------------
protect
Good free blocker; however, to have protection I would like requires a subscription which, with all the subscription "free" programs, the cost is almost prohibitive.  If I were to pay for a for service ad blocker, I would pay for Ad-Blocker Plus.  It is good but costs too much.  Sorry!
-------------------------
block
Great app for blocking ads.
-------------------------
block
The Best Add Block on this Planet.
-------------------------
block
Absolutely amazing!  ✨ I've never had any problems with it.  I love how I can decide which sites I block ads on.  I use it on every single Google account of mine.  I definitely recommend downloading this! 💗
-------------------------
block
Awesome extension! I use it mainly on YouTube and it blocks all the ads in it. So good
-------------------------
block
8 million ads blocked!
-------------------------
block
Works good for me so far... would like a option to show the pats of a website you blocked insted of halving to turn of the extension
-------------------------
block
Great app and it has successfully blocked almost 900 thousand ads in my system! Can't imagine how difficult it will be without this app.
-------------------------
block
Great! I love how you can block specific elements on the page as well. 
Amazing!
-------------------------
block
This adblocker has been very helpful, and its one of the only working adblockers that I've found, one thing though, it doesn't block ads on all sites, I've found a few of them that still play ads, but still, this is a great adblocker and I'd definitely recommend it
-------------------------
block
This is one of the best Adblocker and Pop-up blocker in the chrome store. My school used it for 3 years and i have used it for 4 years. Eventually my school stopped it because they blocked the chrome web store lmao. But either way, this is one of the best adblocker! I am very satisfied with this.
-------------------------
block
Adblock works well if you can use the whitelist and allow your websites that you want to not block you come through undisturbed.
-------------------------
block
Great extension. But when i block element manually and it leads to crash whole page some times is hard to remove last changes. Adding a button to do so, would be nice.
-------------------------
block
Blocked a total of 3,797,928 ads since Feb 26, great work :)
-------------------------
block
works well, but there really should be an "unblock element" in addition to the "block element" feature.
-------------------------
block
Such a great, simple tool. Makes it super easy to not block ads on specific pages as well.
-------------------------
protect
I've used Adblock Plus for several years, and it is easily the most helpful addon that I have ever installed. This addon halts third party tracking, protects my privacy, and removes frustrating adds all in one notion. I would recommend this app to any internet user. Great addon, never had issues :) !
-------------------------
block
It blocked ads. Thanks.
-------------------------
block
The easiest and smartest tool I have ever experienced on add blocking.
-------------------------
block
It is the perfect adblocker!!! All the other adblockers I used either did not block youtube ads or cost money. This is perfect and free.
-------------------------
block
This is probably then best ad blocker you can get (for free atleast), you can block and unblock websties, you can block elements, you can block targeted stuff, ect. I would recomend it
-------------------------
block
Very good. Can block ads on all sites. I have been using it for almost 6 months and I have had no problems.
-------------------------
block
Very helpful and not at all annoying. Recommend to a lot of people who are annoyed with ads blocking view and being confusing. I also like that I can still see some if I want to that I like. I love that it's free too and that google allows it for a lot of dumb websites instead of having to tediously tell each website them self to cut down on the amount of ads they show. It also helps my computer run things faster and I can have enough tabs open for my work. Super good.
-------------------------
block
This app is awesome, and makes my experience very well. I had this for almost one year from now. It helped me avoid all those annoying ads on YouTube, and it saves time. The bad thing about it is when it suddenly stops working, and I have to re-install it to make it work again. It doesn't block every single ad, but it blocks most ads and all the ads that need to be blocked. This extension is one of the extensions I would recommend to people, but it would be nice to support people by disabling it.
-------------------------
block
I had it for over 15 years until it stopped blocking ads on YouTube, then I was recommended UBlock. I've used that ever since.
-------------------------
block
it has been working well so far. much better than adblocker which did NOT block any ad.
-------------------------
block
OMG! So many tracker blocked!! Love this extension!!
-------------------------
block
just spent $5 to help block ads lets see if this works
-------------------------
block
I have been using this service for years now, close to five years I believe. I am more than satisfied with it, and have been since I began using it years ago. If you are looking for a quality ad blocking service, I would highly recommend using this one!
This has gone above and beyond my expectations. I originally starting using it to just block ads when doing schoolwork, but now I rarely turn it off.
-------------------------
block
this thing even blocks viruses. wow
-------------------------
block
I had been having problems with this app not blocking anything, then I saw someones comments about going into settings and choosing your preferences.  I did not realise there was settings, silly me. I now have a perfect blocking system so thank you very much.
-------------------------
block
I like it because it blocks youtube ads which is nice because those are SOOOOOO annoying but i rate it 4 star because its a bit glitchy and it blocked my friends chat with me and i made a new one and it did it again i would rate it 3 star how much work i had to do but i'm a nice guy and i rated it 4 star
-------------------------
block
i love this its free and it blocks annoying ads
-------------------------
block
Blocks all ads, good setting configurations. Best, it's free!
-------------------------
block
Its the best free ad blocker. It blocks every single ad and also tells me how many ads I have blocked.
-------------------------
block
it's working pretty good and I want to suggest that there should be one more feature for kids like parental control to block adult content on the internet than there will not be any need to download another extension or software for both things
-------------------------
block
I absolutely love it. While yes some website force you to disable it, on websites that let you continue even with it on makes my experience better on said websites. This extension makes my experience on chrome much better because it blocks most ads that I normally would encounter. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an adblocker.
-------------------------
block
Simply, THE BEST add block
-------------------------
block
Best chrome extension ever! It blocks those annoying ads in youtube and this definitely smoothen my experience in it. 

Again, many thanks to the developer, much appreciate to your effort.
-------------------------
block
very good love it blocks all ads
-------------------------
block
Blocked Ads. FOR FREE!
-------------------------
block
Works really well. I love the option for allowing acceptable ads, so that I can still help out websites I want to support.

It would be nice to have a function to be able to block redirects, pop ups, and anti adblock detectors.
-------------------------
block
very good. blocks all ads on every website so far as i can see
-------------------------
block
very usefull extension for blocking ads
-------------------------
block
Amazing at blocking. I never knew how quiet my time on the internet could be.
-------------------------
block
It is the best ad blocker for me. It blocks ads in the games I play. It is the best ad blocker I have ever used.
-------------------------
block
100% worth it. It's awesome. I just got it yesterday and I it already blocked over 1,500 items. My gaming has been much faster since I installed this. and now I feel a bit safer. Thank you to the developers of this and keep up the good work. I'd recommend this to anybody.
-------------------------
block
I have used this extension for 7 years now and have loved it. Some sites are getting "smart" and try to block the ad blocker. I just move on to a new site that won't force a million clickbait ads on me. The best Chrome extension I have ever used.
-------------------------
block
I love this thing, had it for a long time, it has never failed me, on my other account has blocked over 20k ads, this account has blocked right around 20k ads, love it totally recommend.
-------------------------
block
finally, i can enjoy videos without having boring ads on them and can watch anime without getting bombarded by ads and it has already blocked over 1k ads in less than a week
-------------------------
block
Realy like the fact that we can add the site so there is no doubt about blocking or not certain site.
-------------------------
block
EPIC! BLOCKS ALL THE ADS!!!!! LOVE IT!!
-------------------------
block
it is the best free ad blocker and it actually blocks ads
-------------------------
block
Very Useful AdBlocker .Blocks Everything
-------------------------
block
Great for YouTube and blocking ads on other sites. Over the summer I have skipped over 27,000 ads
-------------------------
block
It does exactly what it says it does. I immediately tested it after installation, the first thing I notice is all the ads are gone. I also noticed it blocked MORE that I wanted. It works perfectly, but I saw some outlines of where ads are supposed to be. It is a good extension, I just think it could use a few small improvements..
-------------------------
block
Blocks annoying ads. Also has the ability to disable icon tracking. 10/10 would recommend this extension.
-------------------------
block
Loved it. Blocked everything I wanted, better than other competitors I tried. I trust this. Recommend.
-------------------------
block
It's by far my favourite ad blovker and have been using it for years now just make sure to go to settings and enable block all tracking and put OFF acceptable ads
-------------------------
block
Have used this AD Blocking software for years!!!  Works wonderfully, I have never had a problem with it and highly recommend!
-------------------------
block
the best ad blocker it blocks every ads.
-------------------------
block
very nice extension and does exactly what I need it to do... block those annoying ads!  Thanks for a great product!
-------------------------
block
Best blocker EVER!!!!
1st day using my computer i got an avalanche of ads. The day after i got it it was as if ads never existed. If your 5 senses work get  Ad Block Plus NOW!
-------------------------
block
Working very well.Better than all the other adblockers. Easy usage. Can be switched on and off easily. Completely blocks ads even from Youtube. Very useful.
-------------------------
block
Works great! Blocks video ads on windows, chrome os, mac, and much more! Blocks video ads too!
-------------------------
block
I use this at my school and it blocks all the ads which makes schoolwork so much easier!
-------------------------
block
I really loved this adblocker, it can block all of the ads in a page and show properly how many ads were blocked in the page that you are currently at and how many the extension blocked since it was installed in your browser.
-------------------------
block
great it even blocks on youtube
-------------------------
block
blocks my adds
-------------------------
block
this is the best ad blocker ı have ever seen in my life I think that this is the best ad blocker that I could find for chrome. It blocks any ad from any website, including YouTube, that does not have the images embedded into the page. Everything runs so much better and it does not take up any space. There are still those websites that make you disable ad blockers, but that is the only think that could get around it. Overall, this is a great extension to chrome. I would highly recommend this to everyone!
-------------------------
block
Does its job well. To make sure your blocking out all Ads go to settings and make sure "Allow Acceptable Ads" is off.
-------------------------
block
its great, just wish i could block specific ads
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus is the best. Already 65,720 ads have been blocked on my computer :)

Edit: Now it's 951,007
-------------------------
block
Other Ad Blockers may work perfectly well, but this is Currently the only Ad Blocker I can find which successfully blocks everything from YouTube.
-------------------------
block
It really works! I love it so much! Blocks adds on Youtube, amazon, and more!
-------------------------
block
there are plenty of new ads on hulu. adblocker has blocked some, but some still get through. i really expected better.
-------------------------
block
Nearly perfect! Blocks every ad on a page.

I wish I could choose to allow one or two ads per page. But the extensions that promise more adaptability don't actually work. So I'll take what I can get!
-------------------------
block
i really wish it blocked ads on twitch but great overall adblocker!
-------------------------
block
This is a really good ad blocker and i recommend it. I find it very helpful that you can create your own ad block filters. Thanks to the people who made this, you can see that they put time and effort into this! Thank you so much😊
-------------------------
block
it blocks ads, thats all im gonna say, wait and its free!
-------------------------
block
I am loving it so far. Blocking all pop-ups, redirection, etc.
-------------------------
block
I thought it was time to say thank you by writing this review.  Since I've been using Adblock Plus I've come to take for granted that there are no advertisements.  It's literally amazing and I love it.  I can't believe this is free.  I use it on my phone with the same result.  When I first downloaded it I would sometimes get the random ad, but thankfully with the "block this element" feature I almost never see ads anymore.  I don't know how I could ever go back to surfing without it.  I hope this review helps the creators in some way because I truly am grateful.
-------------------------
block
I appreciate offering the middle ground between blocking obtrusive ads and allowing ads for people you wanna support.
-------------------------
block
This is a solid program to block pesky mosquitoes I mean - ads! Thanks
-------------------------
block
An excellent Chrome extension that allows you to easily block ads. It is customizable and convenient.
-------------------------
protect
The feature works behind the scenes protecting from excessive ads on some web sites. It is non-obtrusive and effective.
-------------------------
block
Truly amazing! Free, customizable, allows for individual element blocking, and works. This extension makes the web a saner place.
-------------------------
block
its working fine and blocking most of the ads that used to bother me while browsing most of the website
-------------------------
block
wonderful best ad block on Earth.
-------------------------
block
Brilliant at what it did, till it stopped blocking ads on youtube, which is what I got an AdBlocker for. Going to find a different AdBlocking solution and would advise others to do the same
-------------------------
block
Excellent app. It blocks advertisement
-------------------------
block
Download this and it blocks most of the ads on Hulu if you're watching it on a browser. You're welcome.
-------------------------
prevent
This ad blocker is working very well for me. I have no complaints and it does just what I want it to do; prevent a tsunami of penile enhancements from coming my way. (Not really, more like computer enhancements.)
-------------------------
block
It work perfect for me, it block many ads I don't want to see and it is free.
-------------------------
block
BEST EXTENSION EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BLOCKS ALL ADS AND TRACKERS ALL FOR 0.00$!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GREAT PRODUCT!
-------------------------

Amazing adblocker which meets all my needs. The UI on the settings menu is easy to use and look at, unlike adblockers I've used in the past. Needs popup blocking though
-------------------------
block
amazing, it blocked all youtube ads and i have never seen an ad again

Great ad-blocker. Doesn't block certain ads, (for example, Roblox user ads) but works really well once the element is blocked.

Great to block ads!

DOES THE JOB!  YOU CAN ALWAYS BYPASS ON ANY PAGE@!  THANK YOU

I love the fact that it allows you to get rid of annoying YouTube preview overlays that block the end of the video.  Now I can see the whole thing clearly!
-------------------------

Great application. I watch anime and it blocks all the inappropriate ads on the side
-------------------------
block
I love this extension it blocks all ads and it's completely free.
-------------------------
block
Blocks every add and does not add lag  I love it
-------------------------
block
This used to be one of the best but not anymore and yes it has the "acceptable ads program" so companies can pay to get past it easily.
So now I use a different one. Check it out, maybe it will block ads for you
https://bit.ly/rradb_chrome
-------------------------
block
Works very well! I especially like that you can block individual elements that it occasionally doesn't catch.
-------------------------
block
IT'S BRILLIANT, i searched for ad blocking extensions before and non of them worked properly. Then a friend told me to try Ad Block Plus, i found it in the extensions section, installed it, and iv'e not looked back since. Now whenever i go on a website and the notice comes up to disable my Ad Blocker i cant help but smile. Thankyou  for being an IT Friend.
-------------------------
block
I really like this. Easy adblocker to use, easy to add custom filters, easy to turn on and off. I'm sure there are more sophisticated adblockers out there (adblock plus does have a tendency to block hyperlinks that try to open the link in a new window or tab) but this does everything I need it to do.
-------------------------
block
working great block all ads
-------------------------
block
It Blocks All Ads And Its Useful
-------------------------
block
It just works.

Used it for 2 years. Has never gotten in the way. Only does good things. There have only been a small number of websites that it hasn't blocked ads on, how ever the results are the same as a good DNS sinkhole config. The plugin is as good as it gets for client side ad-blocking.
-------------------------
block
really good.good quality..it makes me happy... one of my best ad block..proudly saying...thanks as block team...
-------------------------
block
A great extension for google chrome browser. Reduces pages loading time a lot and helps with limited internet bandwidth. You have multiple options to help you blocking and unblocking certain ads when you need.
-------------------------
block
Good alternative for many other ad blocking options available.
-------------------------
block
I have blocked over a million ads with this extension, ad block is the most trustworthy and best extension ever.
-------------------------
block
Blocked Every YouTube Add (and all others!) Amazing! 5 stars!
-------------------------
block
Just pure awesome. reccomended if you hate ads that pop up on your screen. its trustworthy, and AWESOME. if there was 100 stars, ill give it 100/100. It exceeds its job by blocking other things that are not ads like social media watching etc.. This is the best adblock, you should try it!!!!!!!!!!
-------------------------
block
ad block plus really works, it's blocking like 18 for every website
-------------------------
block
I cant find the setting to block ads on twitch. otherwise perfect.
-------------------------
block
Very good for blocking pop-ups and other advertisements.
Not so good for blocking specific parts of websites, such as videos from a specific YouTuber.
-------------------------
block
Block acceptable ads. They aren't worth it. 
So you've been using ABP for 7 years?! Nice. How many ads have you blocked
-------------------------
block
This Ad blocker is amazing. Ad Block Plus has a couple of options in the settings to customize web page experience. Or you can just use the default setting, which works great for blocking unwanted and sometimes even harmful ads. I highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
very good and blocks the adds properly
-------------------------
block
This is a really helpful extension that blocks unwanted and harmful ads from view! I LOVE IT!
-------------------------
protect
I find this very useful.  It is quite capable, function rich and educates the user with each item or option selected.  There is so much that this application covers -- far more than I ever thought existed -- and the in depth protections are definitely comforting...
-------------------------
prevent
Love the new social media tracking prevention option.
-------------------------
block
its a cheat for Roblox you can block Roblox ads like games,groups and more.
-------------------------

Such a useful extension! It blocks annoying ads on my computer that can potentially give my pc a virus. Highly recommend 10/10 !
-------------------------
block
Works wonderful. blocks all ads on youtube, deviantart.
-------------------------
block
I've been using this for I don't even know how long and it worked flawlessly until the last couple days. No longer blocks Twitter ads (Promoted) and omg those things are like every other post. Other than that it's spot on!
-------------------------
block
EDIT: may have been a glitch or something, seems to be doing fine blocking promoted tweets now. THANK YOU!
-------------------------
block
This is the only ad blocker that was able to block ads on a math site I was trying to use.
-------------------------
block
just need a pop up block feature
-------------------------
block
Used it in the past and loved it I don't know what has happened though because on my new computer I installed it and of the three days i've had it it is boasting a total of two ads blocked, what an achievement.
-------------------------
block
Works like a charm for blocking youtube ads but every time I log on thru startup the extension disappears and I always have to re- install it ? Any guesses would be very grateful. Thank you.
-------------------------
block
Works very well. 
Just need one improvement so that web pages will not recognize that we are using add block on our PC.
-------------------------
block
Works extremely well! I haven't seen ads in a very long time! Until now sadly. Twitter's new format doesn't let this extension block ads, that's the only problem I've had so far though! Would highly recommend.
I'd just like to request that someone make is so promoted tweets can be blocked again with this so I don't have to manually block them : ))!!
-------------------------
protect
If you browse the web in any way you need to protect yourself, using AdBlock s a great first step.
-------------------------
block
This doesn't block every ad, there are much better adblocker out there like Ublock Origin
-------------------------
block
Absolute legend of an extension. It blocks every ad and ever since I've had it I haven't seen a single ad, even on YouTube!
-------------------------
block
Ad block plus is recommended for my PC let's you keep the ads away such as accessing you tube videos and even other pop ups.
-------------------------
block
I would love if there was an option to only block video ads, but otherwise it does everything perfectly
-------------------------
block
This wonderful extension completely cock blocks any and all YouTubers trying to earn their living and I feel a somewhat sadistic pleasure knowing this. Thank you AdBlock Plus!
-------------------------
block
It worked perfectly it blocked every ad on every web site!
-------------------------
block
Love this extension so much, it's saved me so many hours just by blocking ads. Would recommend to others.

BEST FOR AD BLOCK
I LIKE IT

It is the best! It blocks every ad, lets you control the extension, and doesn't give your device any viruses! Thanks Google :)
-------------------------
protect
All you have to do is set it and forget it. You can read articles uninterrupted, your content loads much faster, it protects you from false links/scamming/spamming/phishing/ID theft, this FREE app does so much.

Great for blocking unwanted popups and sometimes works on streaming.

Ever since I have had Ad Block, it has been excellent having not to deal with popups while working  on my school project.

I have had this for many years, it has served me well by blocking over 25000 ads.

This is by far the best ad blocker out there. Its simpler and easier to use than the other ones. While it doesn't block EVERY SINGLE AD on some pages it still offers a feature where you can manually block the element (blocking it from the code itself) so that any code like that in the elements tab wont show up on the page when you reload it. I would give 4 stars if it didn't have that feature. Overall though, Ad Blocker Plus works VERY WELL and makes load times faster than Firefox.
-------------------------
block
it does da blocking of all the bad ads
-------------------------

What is wrong with this AD Blocker? At first it was OK then recently it doesn't block too much Ads anymore. Especially on Youtube where there was still a pre rolling AD!!! Do something with this!
-------------------------
block
Which other adblocker are you referring to? I am looking for one that blocks all ads. Thanks.
-------------------------

I don't honestly like watching ads, and as a pretty young adult, I don't really care about that stuff and I couldn't go anywhere without running into virus inducing ads. So that's why I got adblock, it prevents any and all ads from showing up, it's fantastic! Don't like nightmare inducing commercials or 3 minute ads about a terrible movies? Adblock Plus! This is recommended for any web surfing loser like myself, take care, everyone, have a wonderful day.

Blocks youtube ads/ WORKS!
-------------------------

I think that this is the best ad blocker that I could find for chrome. It blocks any ad from any website, including YouTube, that does not have the images embedded into the page. Everything runs so much better and it does not take up any space. There are still those websites that make you disable ad blockers, but that is the only think that could get around it. Overall, this is a great extension to chrome. I would highly recommend this to everyone!
-------------------------
block
Awesome!. No More ads. AdBlock plugin is one of the best ads blocking plugin in the World. This extension is very nice because many websites run better without the ads causing turbulence.
-------------------------
block
Reliable and fuss-free. Love the ability to toggle the extension for certain websites and target specific ads with a right-click. I use it almost all the time to block out potential security threats or just to speed up loading. I definitely recommend this over any other ad blocking extensions.
-------------------------
block
Does exactly what it says. No more annoying pop-ups, accidental clicks on malware ads and nothing getting in your way of enjoying the internet. It's easy to turn off if a site blocks it or if you want to support someone through ad revenue.
-------------------------
block
This ad block is so amazing that as soon as I installed it it removed all the annoying ads on youtube. I love it
-------------------------
block
This is incredible! A site tries to make me disable AdBlock,
and I can block the Ad and block the grayed-out screen effect!
We win!
-------------------------

Amazing product, blocks all ads.
-------------------------

Not sure if you've found a replacement by now, but my recommendation has always been ublock origin (make sure it has origin in its name). It's simply the best blocker out there, hands down. Never experienced a single issue, not once, and it blocks absolutely everything. While at the same time giving you total control of exactly what, when, & where to block, if you choose to do so (optional, it works fine default). It's also the lightest on resources, speeding everything up instead of bogging it down. You can also add/enable/check additional filter lists in its settings. There's even one (or a few) that gets rid of all those annoying "disable adblocker" messages you were referring to.
-------------------------
block
You can use VPN it is blocks ads and viruses.
-------------------------
block
Love it, Easy to use, Block all ads!
-------------------------
block
Hands down, this is currently the best adblocking extension. It literally blocks every ad possible. I saw many people complaining about Google ads, what they need to is visit the settings page ones and disable the options for those. After doing that make sure to update your lists. It'll work perfectly fine.
-------------------------
block
Its so good , but sometimes it cannot blocked the ad ~ JUST SOMETIMES 
But still its a good extension <3
-------------------------
block
Its blocking algorithm is excellent and the extension is able to remove the majority of distracting ads. With ADblock plus, my browsing experience is extremely wonderful. Thanks for the developer.
-------------------------
block
I have been having the same issue sadly. I've used this for so many years and worked great in that time. Please fix Ad block plus!
-------------------------
block
It's nice, but if it could block pop-ups that would be great.
-------------------------
block
Y'all need to update to block Facebook sponsored ads. If this issue gets solved, I'll give this add-on 6 stars. All of those who advertise are big companies and can survive without ad revenue. Ain't gonna give another short doses of attention just to give those companies' CEOs their third Aruban mansion.

Awesome!

But try to make it not block all embedded videos from streaming sites... :(
-------------------------
block
I really love Adblock Plus!

It automatically blocks almost every advertisement, even the annoying popup ones on YT videos. It also makes pages load a lot faster on my outdated computer which is a huge plus.

One feature that I really like is being able to whitelist individual websites so AB+ won't block their ads. That gives me the ability to support websites that I like by allowing them to earn a little ad revenue from me. It also makes me feel like I have a lot more control over my privacy.
-------------------------
block
I love this! Adblocker Plus not only blocks those aggravating advertisements that interrupt your day, but also helps keep me away from those tracking sites. It's really great, and I'd recommend it to anyone who asks. 10/10!
-------------------------

Used to block everything! But I think more and more sites have found a way around the adblock, and you need to update it. For now, I guess I'm going to try some other ones. But this one was AMAZING, for more than a year.
-------------------------
block
Its ravenous use of memory and inefficient means of blocking ads by inserting huge style sheets makes this a product that has run its course.
-------------------------
block
Very awesome. Blocks YouTube ads perfectly. I just wish it had some stealth thing that could  allow it on websites that can detect if you are using an adblocker and block you from the site.
-------------------------
block
It does it's job and does it well. I do have some issues with sites which will block access if this is on, but that isn't an issue that can be fixed by this extension. And while it does miss a few ads every once in a while, it has been reliable and makes browsing the Internet much better.

Adblock Plus helped me to prevent the abnormal spike (over 90%) in CPUs core temperatures that occurred upon visiting websites containing poorly coded, CPU-hogging Flash-content, be they ads or non-ads. In addition, Adblock Plus helped with taking out all the notoriously obtrusive, non-Flash Ads in some of the news-websites which offer useful content, but are bad at keeping users' interests above their clueless Ad-Sales Team's interests and their Advertisers' interests.

Moreover, allowing users to whitelist content (ads or non-ads) is the most useful feature. It may require a learning-curve for many folks, but if one can figure out the way to manage that, it offers increased value.

I highly recommend Adblock Plus to every one who desires a rewarding user-experience while making meaningful use of the Web.

Thank you Team EyeO for this great work. May the Force be with you!

Used to work very well, now ads on youtube are still blocked but the videos don't play. Probably because youtube charges to have ads removed now, so not all the fault of the app, but that's pretty much all i used it for. If the youtube access can be fixed it'll deserve the 5 stars again. For now Using AB regular works great.

At the beginning, it blocked a half of ADs.

Then it works well.

I love it, works well & no complaints! Just one suggestion though - for some reason when the little yellow dialogue telling me an ad has been blocked pops up, I kind of ignore it/don't notice it. Sometimes these are popups I actually want to come up and I get confused waiting for something to happen lol.

It would be great to have a few different 'skins'(?) for it!

ABP has really gone downhill. uBlock Origin is much more effective. 

Now that ABP accepts money from a couple large conglomerates (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Taboola) in exchange for being whitelisted, lots of ads just can't be blocked anymore. Just about ALL of the annoying video ads on youtube get through! Not to mention all the tracking happening through cookies, etc.

uBlock Origin is now a much better blocker, and uses significantly less system memory/resources as well.
-------------------------

Adblock is selling ads via a built-in hardcoded whitelist, making it useless for ad blocking. Go with uBlock Origin which is 500x better!

I appreciate this extension developers. Because ad Creaters
Finding the way of bypass adblock plus extension. so adblock plus team also need to find their new ways. I mean daily update need.

Blocks every ad! :)

WOW I can't believe this works so well.  Websites are now readable!  Now if we could update this app to make websites THINK they showed the ad's when they did not.  A few websites are detecting adblock software is installed and now nagging about it.  Block the ads, make the sites think were not blocking the ads, and all will be well.

I've always been a fan since extensions became a thing. People are upset about the acceptable ads, but you can easily disable them in the settings, and even then, at least the ads are clean. I love Eyeo for fighting for our right to block ads!
-------------------------
block
I love the concept of Acceptable Ads. 

For those that aren't aware, this extension doesn't block ALL ads right out of the box. They have this construct called the Acceptable Ads Initiative which allows them to block ads that don't meet strict guidelines set by the Adblock Plus administrators. This allows certain websites to profit off of ads which have been deemed unintrusive, so that the end user does not have to suffer from incredibly distracting ads while still allowing the website to be profitable. 

If this is unacceptable to the user, each user can independently disable this option in the settings menu for a completely ad-free environment.
-------------------------
block
Honestly I just can NOT live without this. This is the BEST and easiest Ad Blocking tool out there. I admit I'm technologically challenged and I get stressed out when I have to deal with a lot of apps or extensions..you have to spend days figuring out the terminology and a vast amount of technical data NOT Adblock Plus just set it and forget it LMAO Fantastic easy to use and effective

It Blocks Annoying Ads in Youtube And Other Websites.

Thanks For Making AdBlock Plus :)
-------------------------
block
This is a great plugin. I am guessing all the 1-star reviews are from morons, or people hired by a competing product.  I love Adblock Plus.  Over 10 million users does not scream 1-star product to me.  I accidentally installed AdBlock on one of my computers instead of Adblock Plus and was shocked at how many ads it failed to block.  Installed Adblock Plus instead and POOF, back to normal.  I have given multiple donations to the developer.  I appreciate that you have the option of getting down into the base level of being able to write your own filters if you need to.
-------------------------
block
Works as indicated. I don't like that I can't see what is being blocked. Maybe a list or something would be nice.
-------------------------
block
Blocks maybe 60 percent of ads.  Still have annoying pages open when on streaming sites, still shows the porn.  Works really well on youtube only.
-------------------------
block
Blocks all ads and works perfectly :D *****

LOVE IT! Successfully blocks ALL ads!!

You know adblock plus doensn't block viruses. yep you gotta get that checked out buddy

If it could block fastlauncher.xyz, that'd be great.

works fine and can manually block adds too
-------------------------

So there was this one page that I always went to and it had pop ups and hyperlinks, it was annoying. I'd block pop ups pretty much try anything and literally just downloaded this went to the website and no ads no pop ups and no hyperlinks. love it already
-------------------------
block
great for the first few months . now lets ads though . its a $ money thing.... The Ad block company now making money from ads they let through. uninstalling and looking elsewhere.
-------------------------
block
Really helps blocking ads. This extension doesn't block all ads but majority of them. 4.5/5. Great!
-------------------------
block
This is a good icon to block ads with
-------------------------
block
I added this extension to block ads, not change them to whatever is "approved" by the developers. Come on, guys, seriously? You're defeating the whole point. I'm downloading uBlock Origin.
-------------------------
block
I've had ad block plus for so long, and I've loved it, it works great. But now that they're being paid to show specific ads, I'm jumping ship to ublock origins. 
I know there's a way to fix it and block all ads on abp, but I shouldn't have to.
Thanks for the years of ad blocking
Ublock origins, here I come
-------------------------
block
AdBlock plus now sells "acceptable ads" which are allowed to circumvent their blocking process. Hard pass
-------------------------
block
Adblock block one ads and switch them to other ads. No, thank you.
-------------------------
block
Well Ad Blocker Plus has sold out and now allows ads through that they consider acceptable! Too bad you couldn't keep doing what you did before and actually block ads.

Total sellout!
-------------------------
block
Hey guys, if you want to block ads even if they paid to be let through, click on your extension, go to the bottom saying Options at the bottom of the GUI, and customize it there. Over all, this blocked ALL the annoying ads. Don't accuse me of being a bot. I know some things are bad about this ad blocker, but I liked it. It worked great. Possibly the best ad blocker on google anyway.
-------------------------
block
Nice!! blocked all ads and popups perfectly and not even a single coin spended for this. Thanx so much!!
-------------------------
block
Fantastic app, block all the rubbish that hinders you when trying to read a web page
-------------------------
block
It is what you want if your not a web tech. It just quietly works behind the scenes and compiles a laundry list of ads that were blocked. Pretty sweet!
-------------------------
block
Please, can you add a hotkey for switch on/off blocking on a page. Thank you. I will give you 5 stars after that.
-------------------------

it is so good in blocking things that it blocked my ex girl friend when she tried to flirt with me :P

Great adblocker. Blocks all ads on the web.
-------------------------

It is the best ad-blocker ever. it blocks everything including youtube ads.

love it..
-------------------------
block
I use this all the time, it's amazing and it blocks all the ads on the sites I go on.
-------------------------
block
Very good for blocking unwanted adds. user always have option to unblock adds from the abp icon on the chrome bar.
-------------------------
block
ABP has an option for its users to accept curated non-intrusive advertising. That is the only kind I would ever consider accepting. ABP offers the option to opt out of that curation, and to block all ads at its maximum strength. It's there, sir; what you do now is up to you. 
-------------------------
block
GOOD EXTENSION

EASY TO USE AND BLOCK ANNOYING ADDS DIRECTLY
-------------------------
block
great work blocks youtube add saves a lot of time!!
-------------------------
block
great extension. does exactly what it's designed to do block unwanted adds. easy to use, reliable and most of all it is very flexible.
-------------------------
block
Adblocker was great and in its day, but most sites nowadays have code to detect if the user has Adblock installed and ends up blocking content. You guys need a way to get around this and make this program usefull again beyond a few sites.
-------------------------
block
I love this extension! It has helped me block those annoying ads! THANKS!
-------------------------
block
Ads suck.
With ABP, you get no more annoying ads. No ads on YouTube videos, websites articles, adf.ly, and if there is a specific ad or image that remains, you can manually block it. ABP is pretty great!
-------------------------
block
the only one I found to block all video content! add your own custom filter!!
-------------------------
block
LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR IT

LONG TIME USER

It's working great for me, blocks all adds and speeds up page loading.
-------------------------
block
it blocks any kind of ads and even the ones i was looking for to block(pop unders) this is really useful and FREE i recommend you get this extension
-------------------------
block
Easy to use.  It is great for blocking ads, especially ads that appear to be tech support and error messages.  Also helps large pages with huge numbers of ads load faster.  (I do sympathize with companies who provide news or tools for free, and I do disable Ad Blocker on those websites, for example newspaper websites, provided the ads are not excessive or confusing.  That is easy to do, just click on the ABP stopsign and deselect "Enabled on this site".)  To sum up, I've used ABP for years and I highly recommend it.
-------------------------
block
this is the best it blocks all add that you can see
-------------------------

Super helpful! Works amazingly to block ads. Better than Norton

Good Ad blocking...

I would give this 4.6 statrsz, but it won't let me. I think that Ghostery is better, except you can block them as you go. And they never bother you again. It's good.
-------------------------
block
I like this extension for blocking ads...!
-------------------------
block
This is simply AWESOME!!!

The developers are doing quite a job with this. It even blocks YouTube ads which occur during the video. I would rate it 6/5 stars
-------------------------
block
Doesn't always block youtube ads. ._. Other than that, I have no complaints. Works as advertised.
-------------------------
block
Blocks more ads than AdBlock; I have both.
-------------------------
block
great app!!! I like looking at all the ads this app has blocked. On youtube for 2 hours, it blocked 5000 ads.
-------------------------
block
Its Awesome for ad blocking...
-------------------------

amazing app, especial with the custom blocking selection, went on my favorite site and bam,ads our gone, than i selected the "report ad" and toda! thank so much
-------------------------
block
blocks all ads perfect for youtube :)
-------------------------
block
It's fantastic! Especially for the increasing number of adverts on YouTube and other such spammy sites.
HOWEVER it does, by default block all images on google photos, but that's Ok because you can disable the blocker for such situations.
You can also disable the blocker for sites you wish to support, like charities and freeware sites.
Keep up the good job!
-------------------------
block
It works great, and it blocked about 20,000 ads so far.
Only thing I'll say is that it could use an on/off switch.
-------------------------
block
well done! its blocking all the ads.
-------------------------
block
awesome ad block extension
-------------------------
block
This functions very well. Blocks many ads if not all of them. Helps speed up the web page I visit and I'm not bombarded with constant pop up ads and movies.
-------------------------
block
Awesome! the proper extension for blocking f**king ads..... Use only this add on , adding multiple ad blockers can slow browser performance and some are fake/malware,recording your cookies and keystrokes.fyi.
-------------------------
block
it is the best extension ever since I had to receive windows 10 and did not ask for it....it blocks ads so I can concentrate on whatever I am doing online and I can listen to my youtube music without interruptions ...thanks so much......Sandra Loerch

AMAZING! it blocked A TON of advertises
-------------------------
block
@Rilriia Kilurden I wish we all knew how everything works before we could review them. For example, to tell my friend how much I like my new apartment, that it doesn't have a damp problem or it is airy, I perhaps should know what is a Tartan Grid, how the Fenestration structurally interacts with the Miesian parti despite being an afterthought. Given your tone of (relatively) great expertise on matters of advertisements on the Internet, you must have surely understood what this 'amateur' is talking about and also the amount of truth in the words. Yes, it does block ads which cover most of the page i.e. be intrusive. Yes, there are intrusive ads which, on clicking 'x' or 'close', redirect to the respective link being advertised and literally trick us. To end my statement, the review is accurate, helpful and not intellectually grating; your reply is not.
-------------------------
block
among so many other Ad block extensions i used this is simply the best.
-------------------------
block
loved it. best ad block. works in everything. if you  are waiting and doesn't work its because your internet connection is not the best. I use an Ethernet and works very good.
-------------------------
block
I had to give it a 3 because it was causing such a delay in my apps opening up. Also, the best thing about this extension is that it did block ads.  Although sometimes an ad would sneak through!  But for those who don't mind waiting so long for your app to open up, this is the best.
-------------------------
block
Can block any add, and works flawlessly.
-------------------------
block
i like how theyre saying theyre making the internet a better place when the internet relys on ads 

basically cuting off food to the people who add to the internet and make it still free with no fees yet... 

and here are some ad block programs putting their own ads over the existing ads 

how ironic 

a leech is what you guys are to the internet .
-------------------------
block
I just love this extension because it's blocks all the annoying ads that I don't want to see! I mean, that is what an adblocker is for, right?
-------------------------
block
Very good. Blocks almost all ads. Even if any ads got past the filter, the block element feature is sure to remove it!

This extension is a resource hog and now allows "Acceptable Ads." The point of an ad blocker is to block ads, so by removing the entire point of the extension I've been forced to use a different (and better) extension. Bye adblock plus!

Some things it doesn't block, but it's pretty good.
-------------------------
block
One of the best extensions ever. Some ads may still pop up, but thanks to Adblock Plus, most are kept at bay, especially the spammy ones on social networking sites such as facebook. It also helps to improve the performance of your browser when playing games, as a lot of the ads that it blocks would have been using the same plug-in which games on the browser use, thus slowing down the game's functions. With this extension, your web games performance will be enhanced.
-------------------------
block
very good tool for blocking youtube ads  . it wont block everything but adequate for free and not annoying it blocks most annoying pop up ads .
-------------------------
block
Wow! It works better than my old adblock program. Now I can click annotations, and I don't think it blocks "Read More" on youtube. By the looks of it, it should block ads on other websites besides youtube :D.
-------------------------
block
Had this for years, worked perfectly everytime. The best extension you can get for chrome! I have over 1,000,000 ads blocked from all the years ive used this!

Works PERFECTLY!!!!!!

To all of you who claim that AdBlock Plus is NOT doing its job - START READING BELOW!

A big thank you in advance, Elad Karako! YOU, Sir, saved me years of headaches. Wish I had discovered this years ago...

Posted by Elad Karako, Dec 4, 2015:

"1. you should remove the checkmark from "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" in the extension settings :)

2. 
also- add few other lists from this post:
http://icompile.eladkarako.com/adblock-lists/

the most intrusive ads can be blocked even before you open your browser using your computer's DNS service (google "blocking ads using HOSTS file")

anyway me and few others are maintaining a list of those bad domains (tracking, ads, popups, malware)

the lists are published at https://github.com/eladkarako/hosts.eladkarako.com
and I've added a new AdBlock list named "hosts_adblock" which is useful if you don't want to use your computer's HOSTS file, but still want to block all those ads.

it updates few times a week.
direct links:

the "hosts_adblock" list:
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts_adblock.txt

the HOSTS files:
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts0.txt
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts.txt

the plain domain list:<br>http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts_raw.txt

hope you'll find it useful, I've never saw a single ad for 3 years now :))))"

I love you Adblock plus, you get rid of those annoying youtube adds,you get rid of all those annoying "CLICK HERE FOR 1 MILLION DOLLARS" ADS, you also get rid of those startling ads that actually  have sound and are usually advertising something really loud when you are trying to chill and surf the web. I love you adblock plus. I love all your many features such as being able to run or not run on some websites depending on the users preference, i also love how you can pick to block something if its not blocked.

This a wonderful extension. The block element button is so useful as well as the number of ads blocked shown on the button.

Does good job over ublock, though I used before ublock, noticed  many non-english websites with builtin adults ads.
this ext. blocks, but ublock does not. it's simple as that.
why not excellent and 5 stras? s

Well since the original Adblock decided to stop blocking ads for me, I had to find a new and improved software that would continue to do so and this was the answer! So far no complaints as it has worked 100% well for me! Granted, I have a separate ad block for youtube so I do not know if that is related and if it truly does not block youtube ads, but since I am covered, that is all I care about. Thanks for your service!

I love this app! It does what it needs to do. I use Google Chrome as my only web browser if at all possibl and it blocks alla ads except some huluplus video ads and all YouTube video ads.

-------------------------
block
I'm very satisfied with this ad blocker. It also supports websites by only blocking the intrusive ads.
-------------------------
block
It's nice for blocking out intrusive ads, but doesn't stop scripted popups or some Flash embeds from playing.  It also slows everything to a crawl on my new computer.  It's actually slightly faster with the extension disabled!
-------------------------
block
It's a great tool. Easy to turn off, easy to customize what should get blocked. Simple interface, although the pseudo-regex (using wildcards) pattern you need to use to add to the blocked list is a little tricky... still, it never crashes and doesn't slow down Chrome!
-------------------------
block
This is letting ads through. For being the "plus" version, it sure is worse than the original adblock. Adblock actually blocks all ads, unlike adblock plus.
-------------------------

4 stars only because there are a few popups that it doesn't block. Rarely ever happens though. A must have for any avid Internet user.

nice extension
blocking ads
-------------------------
block
Thank you so much! Blocks all the ads I hate, including the pop up ones with embarrassing pictures.
-------------------------
block
It's great overall, blocks most annoying ads.. problem is that it blocks "flag counter" and isnt much powerful against "bad" type of tracking services. Overall good app, been using it for a long time and dont plan to get off.
-------------------------
block
has done well for me. blocks all...you tube ads, pop under ads, pop up ads....streaming music blocks ads....good stuff!
-------------------------
block
Blocks everything. Ad free surfing!!!
-------------------------
block
Really useful when having limited internet connectivity since it blocks ads that are irrelevant to my work. It also cuts the distractions of working on the Internet,
-------------------------
block
This used to be an amazing app! It blocked all ads, fantastic! However, lately it's not working at all. I'm bombarded with ads all the time.. super frustrating...!!!!
-------------------------
block
It allows ads by deafult, instead of blocking it.
-------------------------
block
Blocks all annoying ads!
Good job guys!
-------------------------
block
It does an excellent job blocking ads everywhere.
Plus it has the options to block malware domains, disable trackers and remove social media buttons. These options appear in the post install page that opens. You should also use all or some of these options, especially the malware domain blocking.

neat little extension that blocks (most) ads and annoying pop-ups..
-------------------------
block
worked well. started blocking ads right when i installed it!
-------------------------
block
I love it.  IT EVEN BLOCKS POPUPS FROM WATCHFREE.TO AND PUTLOCKER.IS
-------------------------
block
Best ad block out on the internet :D
-------------------------
block
I really like it.  It does what it claims, blocking annoying, unwanted ads from your device, but it doesn't block all of them. Still receiving annoying ads for games and products I have no interest in.
-------------------------
block
fantastic, very customisable with the block element feature, loved it.
-------------------------
block
This is the best ad blocker I have seen and the block element feature is very useful!
Great job developers :)
-------------------------
block
Brilliant works and blocks annoying ads
-------------------------
block
GREAT extension.  It shows you how many ads have been blocked (optional), and even blocks a LOT of the smut embedded IN pages.  LOVE IT!
-------------------------
block
This extension began to block everything but HTML pretty much every website I visited recently after using it for years. After a quick reinstallation everything is back to normal. All the same this is my favorite extension ever and does an AMAZING job of blocking ads.
-------------------------
block
Love it guys :) a must for web surfers. Blocks a lot of ads.
-------------------------
block
great extension, blocks annoying adds on facebook and other sites
-------------------------
block
It does an okay job on web pages.  It would be better if it also blocked adware extensions from being installed on the Chrome browser without permission.
-------------------------
block
awesome app blocks all unwanted adds and links and somewhat makes the internet a little faster
-------------------------
block
it is blocking all the adds, it's good for now.

-------------------------

it's block any annoying ad !
-------------------------

This is an amazing AdBlock, it works in such an extent that it can block a malware virus from pop-ups. I highly recommend this addon to anyone who hates ads or has malware.
-------------------------
block
Works very well, blocks almost all the annoying ads as well as pop-ups. GREAT!!!

Best Extension to Block Add in Google Chrome

This blocks all ads and doesn't slow down your browser at all!
-------------------------
block
Nice application for ad blocking...
Awesome
-------------------------
block
great resource. my son adds it to my web browsers to keep spam adverts off my system and he even adds custom lists, for my personal prefs and it doesn't bog down my system!

GREAT EVEN FOR OLD LADIES! tested on an ASUS running Win 8.1 64-bit -touchscreen

5 STARS [smooth as silk now], and now that FanBoy's list has been added to EasyList it's 10 Stars!

note: supports international lists, so you can get comprehensive ad blocking coverage, in any region and if malwared? install the south pacific lists; especially CHINA!*

*they are why we need ad block by default and a script blocker/flash blocker. waiting on NoScript for Chrome! :D

SEE?! EVEN OLD LADIES CAN USE/INSTALL THIS! ;)
-------------------------
block
Really good, blocks tons of adds everywhere no matter what!
-------------------------
block
Really nice at blocking basically everything!! :D

This app is AWESOME and blocks all ads.I suggest this app to everyone.Thanls!!!

best add-on i've ever had. if not for blocking ads on YouTube, then for all the other sites i frequently use. I AM NOT A MACHINE, I AM A HUMAN.

block
Really great. Blocks all ads so it works well.
-------------------------
block
It help to block unwanted popup ads from crome

-------------------------
block
it blocks maximum ad.
-------------------------

I really love how this "extension" blocks all the ads in every website, that I go on. Really perfect, for my browsing experience.
-Declan Miles | NEONGT1

block
Blocks everything and even if it doesn't you can manually block this is the best extension in existence
-------------------------
block
It blocks ads as reported.
Also this: https://palant.de/2014/07/29/which-is-better-adblock-or-adblock-plus
-------------------------
block
When I installed it, I had my doubts it would do all it claims. I was happily surprised that it indeed did all it claimed. I've gotten so use to having it with it's AWESOME capabilities, hi-quality blocking, & how much better it makes surfing the internet, it's definitely an Extension I can't go without!!

**Update**
I removed AdBlock Plus & tried out other ad blockers because I wanted to see if AdBlock Plus was still the best. Within these last week I've tried all of the high-ranking, highly reviewed blockers & after all that research & trial periods, I was fed up. Only took a few days without AdBlock Plus to realize just HOW GREAT this extension really is & that there are NONE OTHERS that are even close to having anywhere near the same level of protection & blocking! IT TRULY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST AD-BLOCKER AVAILABLE TODAY!!
-------------------------
block
Brilliant extension.  Gets rid of all the annoying crap ads, leaving only the genuine site content.  Also, if you ever download stuff to install, it blocks those confusing 'Download now!' buttons that try to fool you into thinking *that's* your download, only to fill your computer with spyware. Wouldn't be without it.
-------------------------
block
block all tha ads on youtube, work well for me
-------------------------
block
did what I wanted it to do, block all those banner ads which I find so annoying and dont like that ad companies spy on ur surfing to bring u those.TY for some speed and privacy back!
-------------------------
block
Amazing blocks all ads on my computer!
-------------------------
block
i love this app blocks all ads
-------------------------
block
This works great. It blocks annoying ads from most websites. On top of not seeing annoying ads it also provides another level of security from rogue ads with viruses. You can allow some ads through if you choose. Ads make free sites free so I don't mind the few that make it through.
-------------------------
block
Must have for every browser user. Excellent features for blocking unwanted adds on pages.
-------------------------
block
Great not just for blocking ads, but works great to block tracking as well.
-------------------------
block
Blocked over 1700 ads today, and thats just from a few 1 hour nightcore vids on youtube, keep it up!
-------------------------
block
great app for blocking adds. thankyou xoxo
-------------------------
block
It was so good! Blocked ALL my ads!
-------------------------
block
Blocks everything you don't want to see. great stuff
-------------------------
block
One of the best Ad Block apps ever.
-------------------------
block
Very good! It works on older versions of Chrome but it doesn't block text-based advertisements.
-------------------------
block
Blocks every add, no YouTube adds, Twitch adds, or anything. Great app <3
-------------------------
block
Very good addon, capable even blocking youtube ads.
-------------------------
block
Thank you for sharing your opinion! It has been instrumental in me choosing to use this application as well! All those ads were actually blocking me from checking out when making a purchase! I DID NOT LIKE that at all!
-------------------------
block
Would be nice if it blocked all ads.  I am specifically talking about pop-under ads.  I have seen quite a few lately.

Would also be nice to see what was blocked.
-------------------------
block
works as advertised. Blocks annoying Youtube Ads
-------------------------
block
Perfect! I can choose when to block adds and when not.
-------------------------
block
Wow.. Its just awesome... Blocks all the ads.. Thanks ...
-------------------------
block
nice job..it is really useful and blocks all those ads..
-------------------------
block
Love this, it is awesome!  I do not have those adds popping up blocking everything. Now I can read what type and see what is on the screen.
-------------------------
block
It works perfectly! It kept adware from attacking every website I visit. (In fact, it blocked a total of about 120 ads at one point. 0_o I mainly got this because of pointless Adware.)
-------------------------
block
Works at blocking almost all ads. The ads that aren't blocked already can be right clicked and blocked manually, and once this is done they will never appear again on your pc. Excellent extension.
-------------------------
block
pretty good :x i love it, block 'em all
-------------------------
block
BEST THING EVER. This has made the internet awesome again. I despise advertisements and it blocks them ALL! Even on youtube. Can't say enough about how much I absolutely love adblock.
-------------------------
block
Is all that this addon has done is block normal advertisers and put their own pop up adds on instead. It does work well with utube though. So worth one star
-------------------------
block
It's great, but needs work. It blocks around 85% of all ads, while you still need to download other extensions to get the rest. 

Definitely a MUST HAVE extension for every browser.
-------------------------
block
Does a great job keeping annoying adds off the page. 
Blocks some non-add content too.
-------------------------
block
CANNOT BROWSE WITHOUT AD BLOCK. GREAT APP

while other ad block with most popularity is sh*t  :) :)
-------------------------
block
ad block plus blocks my ads thank you!
-------------------------
block
Great, it blocks most annoying ads
-------------------------
block
It blocks ads effectively without negative effects on your computer (as far as I can tell) but it does have a few times where ads do appear and the annoying blocked ad count (That can be disabled, but still).
I'd highly recommend for anyone who doesn't want ads on youtube or anything else, for a very cheap price.
-------------------------
block
this is very helpful to keep the ads blocked
-------------------------
block
Love the app. I don't mind the "unobtrusive" ads and this app does block the truly annoying ads that make internet content hard to obtain!
-------------------------
block
Will not block banner ads in Chrome. Works just fine with Facebook. Hint!
-------------------------
block
Great for blocking out unnecessary ads that completely ruin websites and music players.
-------------------------
block
Great, helps block annoying ads from sites!
-------------------------
block
Even blocks facebook ads! Amazing!
-------------------------
protect
The best ad protection available from chrome. I don't even remember what an ad looks like anymore.
-------------------------
block
Very nice application.!!! If anybody have any issue pl revert me. I will suggest you the best and make sure that you will definitely change your review. Also This application is blocking adds only and if your system have any bad infections or extensions then it will not help you the most. but as I checked it, it is very good app with free of cost.
-------------------------
block
Not blocking any ads at all, it used to work just fine though.
-------------------------
block
It's very good.. Helps me always blocking all the annoying ads...
-------------------------
block
Ad block is a great extension as it brings a more comfortable web environment however ad block can cause YouTube channels to lose money so get it if you don't give a s**t about you-tubers.
-------------------------
block
it helped me block most of the adds but not all of them..
-------------------------
block
This extension is probably the best one out there. It blocks ad's on all websites, guaranteed,  plus, its a non-virus extension. 5 stars on this one.
-------------------------
block
Amazingggg blocks all ads
-------------------------
block
it is the best ever add blocking tool
-------------------------
block
+5star. Works wonderfuly. 

Please note: Anyone having trouble with adblock no longer blocking ads, close all tabs/wepbages, remove it and re-add. Works for me all the time (May require you to restart your browser)
-------------------------
block
Dont block ads by wizzard etc D: but its good for another ads :D
-------------------------
block
Love it! It really blocking everything.
-------------------------

Perfect for Youtube AD block
Don't need to wait 5seconds

cool blocks all types of ads :)
-------------------------
block
Always there to block annoying adds. Have been using it for 3 years now without any issues.
-------------------------
block
I love this product.  I am stunned when the ad blocked counter in the upper right hand corner climbs!  I don't think I NEED that many ads to make my life complete.  A few ads seem to slip through at times but, it seems that they are the exception OR ad block is updating.  I don't say this TOO often but, if this cost any money, it would be well worth it.  Thank you so much!
-------------------------
block
Worked great, blocked ads well - with the option to turn it off for sites you wish to support. 5 Stars
-------------------------
block
doesnt block all but blocks almost all really nice love it
-------------------------
block
Perfect! Blocks ads on youtube and facebook. Doesn't work on Hulu though but I think that's just how Hulu rolls.
-------------------------
block
I love it, blocks almost everything I want it to. I'd say my rating is more of a 4.5 rather than a 5, but as I've used it for so long, it certainly deserves my 5. There's room for improvement and hopefully there will be. However, it still serves its purpose better than anything else I've seen or used.
-------------------------
block
wonderful, it block the awful advertisements on the  websites... perfect application and useful
-------------------------
block
Used this Extension for over 2 years and NEVER had an issue aside from me rolling back my PC yesterday and came to find for some reason i had to reinstall ABP along with Chrome itself due to an error; when i went to open chrome ABP was still installed but the statistics didnt show anything in the little icon window and it wasn't blocking any ads even when enabled on the current page. Still ★★★★★ definitely.
-------------------------
block
Great tool for blocking annoying ads. I'm saving valuable time every day by not being forced to watch these 30-second+ ads while browsing.
-------------------------
block
Blocked many non-sense adds.... good to have
-------------------------

Great extension for blocking boring ad.
-------------------------
block
blocks all adds Absolutley great!
always going to use it
-------------------------
block
It blocks some items on my schools website. Works awesome besides that.
-------------------------
block
yes you can have your ads not blocked by them this is for bad ads not all but you can have all ads blocked if you just go to settings and adblock plus is wayyyyyy better than adblock so..... i rest my case
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus is amazing and I recommend it to everyone. It completely blocked all ads and pop-ups. I accidently clicked something that gave me a lot of pop-ups all the time, but adblock blocks it. Also in youtube, it is great to skip all the ads.
-------------------------
block
Awesome app...
It blocks every single unnecessary adds, making the page load faster.
Very Very Very Nice.
-------------------------
block
Works perfectly, with no problems... great tool for Internet casuals. Next step is adding hosts blocking to the PC and the Router (via DD-WRT).

If Miika Ahonen had viewed the .png in question, he'd see it's the adblock 'ads blocked' counter. If he stopped browsing the sites that were trying to rapidly pop-up ads, he wouldn't have that problem. You obviously did some work to find what your PC was doing, don't cry wolf on adblock.
-------------------------
block
It's awesome 
will blocks all things I don't wanna see
-------------------------
block
Extremely useful extension. Would be better if it could block the adfly kind of ads.
-------------------------
block
Does what it says!  Blocks Ads!
-------------------------
block
This extension is brilliant. Nobody should ever have to see an ad again. It's very reliable and it keeps a count of how many ads it's blocked on any given page. This thing is WAY under appreciated. Definitely a must-have!
-------------------------
block
it really blocks all the ads on any website thank you for making it free not only Adblock but Adblockplus
-------------------------
block
Fantastic!  Blocks ads wonderfully, have had no issues with this extension in the months I have used it. I've recommended it to all of my coworkers and friends!
-------------------------
block
nice way to block adds on browser
-------------------------
block
Finally a working ad blocking app
-------------------------
block
blocks adds and everything very nicely
-------------------------
block
excellent. blocks all ads
-------------------------
block
Great program! It blocks many ads without messing with the rest of a web page.
-------------------------
block
Awesome! It works great!
I had it in Firefox and it worked OK, but then I noticed it here and got it! Thank you Adblock Plus for blocking annoying/inappropriate ads!
-------------------------
block
It was great and I'm a longtime user who's finally uninstalling it for the competition. 

It's now nearly impossible for me to block any advertising in gmail and I've tried to workaround this for some time. 

I suggest people look elsewhere and choose an addon that doesn't sell out.
-------------------------
block
I have found it the best tool to deny annoying ads on most every website I view. It sometimes blocks up to 600 plus on my Yahoo mail account in any given time frame. Just make sure that you delete it from Google Chrome if your computer needs to reboot due to new auto updates to your computer. I have found this wonderful tool likes to be informed that there was a system update. How do you know it's not working? If you don't see a single ad block at Yahoo Mail or some other site where there have been plenty of ads blocked in the past, delete the extension and reinstall it after a reboot. It's GREAT!
-------------------------
block
Best extension ever? Probably, as the Internet is all but unbearable without it. Very successful at blocking horrible, intrusive advertising.
-------------------------
block
blocks every single one of 'em.. i really love this one..
-------------------------
block
it's very useful.it blocks dozens of annoying adds
-------------------------
block
good on block ads
-------------------------
block
Love how it blocks all ads. I just wish it wouldn't sometimes stop working to where I have to download it again and again. But I will always keep coming back to this. Love it!
-------------------------
block
instant pop up and Ad blocks!!
-------------------------
block
wow! it block every single ad, even video ads! it doesn't just block them, it completely removes them from the website! 5 stars!
-------------------------
block
Adblock used to be amazing but now its not blocking any ads ! My page is beyond filled with ads all the time.
-------------------------
block
10/10 its great for blocking stupid ads
-------------------------
block
Highly recommend AD Block Plus, works great for blocking ads from many sites. Using it with Pandora/youtube cuts out all adverts. Be cautious when   creating custom blocks, you may be blocking too much. Other than that, enjoy, you'll love it.
-------------------------
block
really useful in blocking unwanted ads
-------------------------
block
best ad blocking app on the store.... job nicely done....

Would have been better, it it would have blocked ads in incognito mode. 
Any ways very good.
-------------------------
block
OMG This App is a sanity-saver!! I couldn't work without it! I am easily distracted by moving, flashing, intrusive banners on websites....Ad Block Plus kills 'em all! 
It rids me of the complete annoyance of idiotic internet ad campaignes. Honestly, if I want something-I'll go and by it!! Thanks Ad Block and Ad Bock Plus!!!!
-------------------------
block
It is really a better solution to block all the annoying ads.
-------------------------
block
It blocks all the useless   adds and now I can watch everything without any add and now watching online live streaming of sports is easy or there are tons of adds.
-------------------------
block
Great product! But Adblock can block more than Adblock Plus...
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus is too much better than Adblock! Block all ads automatically. Awesome!
-------------------------
block
BLOCK THE ANTI-ADBLOCK

-------------------------

Don't know about other Adblock extension, but i found this extension best to use to block annoying Ad. And i hate it when some website can detect this extension. Again this extension help me to save lot bandwidth from unnessesary Ad.

Thank you for this free extension

Blocks all useless ads.

If the adblock plus could also block surveys, then it would be 5 stars. But besides that, its awesome. Recommend for all users
-------------------------
block
Cannot visit any website without having this on. It's the best ad block out there.
-------------------------
block
Better than any other ad block extension in blocking facebook ads.
-------------------------
block
This extension is amazing!! It blocks all those stupid ad's on YouTube and on any website you go on, honestly im surprised how good this is! 
5 STARS!
-------------------------
block
finally an extension that blocks facebook newsfeed ads and promoted pages + those ads on torrent sites
-------------------------
block
Blocks all useless ads! Watching videos is a breeze now.
-------------------------
block
This is a best ever software I've used in terms of browsing protection and ad blocking. Cheers!!!
-------------------------
block
A must for anyone who streams online sports or similar. Blocks all those stupid adds that popup on the stream player and stops you getting malware! Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
great, better than ADblock as this one can actually block youtube ads which are very annoying.
-------------------------
block
Without a doubt the absolute best Blocking Software on the market today. 100% satisfaction Highly Recommended by AnonymousNovaScotia.

It's a good adblocker, I would recommend anybody buy this. It blocks 99 out of 100 ads.
-------------------------
block
I only have it for one day but I must say it's doing a marvellous job! It's blocked everything, all the annoying pop up ads and ads that appear before videos or online games! Very nice!
-------------------------
block
This is unbeliveably helpful! I currently have one of the fastest Chromebooks out there and this makes it even faster! I love it! It even blocks adds on YouTube! I don't think I could go without this app  anymore! Exllent job!
-------------------------
block
I haven't found an ad that it doesn't block.  It's amazing!  Doesn't slow down the PC, actually speeds it up, because unblocked ads are what slows mine down.  

Today, it stopped working for some reason.  No big deal.  I disabled it, then re-enabled it right away, and it was working fine.  5 seconds & 2 clicks, and all was good.
-------------------------
block
it's the best blocking app
-------------------------
block
Best extension ever, does a great job of blocking ads and allows me to disable it for certain sites that I know are good and think they deserve my advertisement money.
-------------------------

Very good blocker, it can  
block all the annoying ad

block
cool really blocks ad's

LOVE IT!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH for blocking all the excessive and annoying ads that were always blocking my browser and leading me to other websites when I click the 'X' button. THANK YOU ADBLOCK PLUS!! Finally! I can watch all my drama in peace! =D
-------------------------
block
Very Great! Blocks all ads for a cleaner webpage look. It's especially useful when it comes to blocking those annoying talking ads. Love this extension.
-------------------------
block
ABP has saved me thousands of minutes of annoying ads over the course of the year. To date it has blocked 260,000 Ads this year.
-------------------------
block
It blocks almost all of the ads, all of them except for the ones that came with my last adblocker... D: There were some annoying ones it didn't catch, but the create-your-own-filter is a wonderful thing and that blocked all the annoying ads. There's still one bit of in-text ads that I can't disable without getting rid of the whole word, but this is still the best adblocker I can find- and it didn't come with any ads!
-------------------------
block
Surfing was becoming so frustrating, with ads playing over what I was trying to watch, constant redirects and pop-up ads blocking text.  So far, it's been great and thoroughly recommend along with Adblock.
-------------------------
block
Worked instantly! Blocks all ads, pretty much, and even on streaming sites... The annoying questionable ones on the side!
-------------------------
block
Thank you ABP for blocking out so many unwanted ads and rubbish all over the internet!

Works wonders for me! I love that it blocks all kinds of ads!

It does what it says it will do - block all the annoying ads!
It's also really simple to disable it on specific sites where you do want the pop-up
So glad I downloaded this.
-------------------------
block
It does really blocked ALL annoying ads. Loved it!
-------------------------
block
Very nice. Clean design, simple to use, don't get rid of it because it is a good program. If I didn't need some of the ads just for information purposes when I'm online doing research, I would block every single ad and feel comfortable that this program has the ability to do it and I don't have to keep messing with it to tweak it to block this and that. A very useful program to cut down on spyware and other tracking junk that our computers don't need.
-------------------------
block
Good however it blocks LiveFyre stuff at the moment, which is a big knock against this program.
-------------------------
block
EXCELLENT FOR AD BLOCKING

It work good blocking adds but it doesn't remove I social media buttons as it says.
-------------------------

blocks all the crap pop-ups that no one likes.

block
The best thing ever made for the internet. 1million ads blocked so far !!! <3333
-------------------------
block
does what it says it does. Blocks ads and allows me to manually block ads best plugin on chrome store imo.
-------------------------
block
blocks all the stuff I really dont want to see. thankyou
-------------------------
block
works extremely well, had the original extension first for a very long time and then added this one to it, exzcellent! although it doesn't block the new form of ads designed to get past adblocks which are hyperlinks on all kinds of random words and phrases--so annoying but i jus pay attention where i hover lol
-------------------------
block
Excellent, blocks adds from most sites I visit. I love it!!!!
-------------------------
block
very nice, blocked 330k ads with it! i can directly watch my youtube vids and not worry about muting ads with sound.
-------------------------
block
Watching streaming video on YouTube and other Internet sites is enjoyable again.  It is great to zoom past all 2:30 minutes of commercials that used to pop up while watching my favorite shows.  I just watch the clicker tick off the number of blocked ads as it fast forwards through them in seconds.
-------------------------
block
Blocks everything, works fast. Only concern is the loss of revenue from the sites but the new initiative to allow non-intrusive adds seems like the perfect way to regulate overly annoying flashy noisy adds all over every website.
-------------------------
block
42,196 Ads Blocked and counting! Best ad-blocker around!
-------------------------
block
I enjoy this extension very much because it works wonders.
Now, for people who have trouble blocking ALL ADS: listen: you must
1)go to chrome settings, then extensions
2)click on OPTIONS on the  extension Adblock plus
3) UNCHECK the box that says "allow some non-intrusive advertisements"

hope that helps!
-------------------------
block
compared to "adblock", this thing blocks virtually nothing. I get popup ads all over newspaper sites, etc.

the similar name is confusing people, to be sure... adblock seems far superior in terms of consistently blocking tons of ads.
-------------------------
block
Block ads forever..
-------------------------
block
Works great when it works, more often than not though it just doesn't function even when I manually block an element.
-------------------------
block
Great. Installed it a few 
hours ago and has already blocked 130 ads !

It also speeds up my internet because i dont need to load those annoying ads
-------------------------
block
It does really well at blocking most ads, but there are some ads that this app doesn't seem to notice. Otherwise, it manages everything cleanly.
-------------------------
block
Works great on youtube blocking all the annoying video ads they make you watch before you can watch an actual video you want to see!!!
-------------------------
block
Simply amazing.  No AD's ever.  Even youtube ads are blocked.  Honestly the first free app i would pay for and almost wish we could donate to.  If you like pages on facebook you CANNOT block what you call pop ups.  Macs hardly need protection but this app is a must for any mac user.If you are using windows expect some ad's but in the year i have had ad block it has blocked over 76,000 ad's.
-------------------------
block
This was working when I installed it about a week ago, but it doesn't block anything or detect anything when Chrome is in Windows 8 mode. Works fine on desktop mode though.
-------------------------
block
Works wonders!  It blocks all of the annoying ads and discretely hides them away.  Webpages are presented as they should be sans the advertising.  It occurred to me how well this extension works when I used a friends' computer which was not running Adblock Plus.  I couldn't believe how many ads this extension blocks!  However, this extension is not perfect.  The only drawback I have found is that it will incorrectly block the basic functionality of certain websites.  This can be easily fixed by adding the site to your "Whitelist".  I gave it five stars because this is one of the essential extensions you should use! I have used this on Opera and Firefox as well.  Works just as well on any browser.
-------------------------
block
superb ad blocking app. it never shows me any ads . Just loving it
-------------------------
block
It was very nice and helped block popup ads and my computer didnt slow down at all.
-------------------------
block
Great thing to block selected elements.
-------------------------
bypass
Amazing App. I have used ABP (and its various forks across browsers) for years. Recently it seems to not be working as well. Not sure if this is due to websites being extra diligent in bypassing ABP or what, but it has really made me realize how amazing this is when it works! Keep up the development :).
-------------------------
block
Blocks all ads on YouTube as well as websites. Great app, would recommend it.
-------------------------
block
best ad block ever! no probs what so ever! recommend to anyone who is having too much of ads! blocks ads on FB too :)
-------------------------
block
Works very well, doesn't block banners on a few foreign language sites.
-------------------------
block
It is an awesome software blocks every single ad & does not affect the internet speed
-------------------------
block
This is very useful to me as I installed an app on my PC and random ads appear everywhere and obstruct my view while browsing the web. With this extension, I can block all these unwanted ads. Thank you.
-------------------------
block
Really capable of blocking those adds that are annoying.
-------------------------
block
very help me for  me to block some adutl ads and more faseter browsing
-------------------------
block
Inconstant blocking ads. Regular adblock works much better.
-------------------------
block
It is Amazing on how well it can block ads that are unwanted. I highly recommend this to all of my friends, and even to my girl friend. AdBlock Plus, is Amazing.
-------------------------
block
I've been using this extension for almost a year now and I've never had an issue with it. It blocks just about everything you can imagine! This is an absolute must-have.
-------------------------
block
great extension!! also can block tracking so all those spam and tracking sites can no longer customize personal ads by watching/tracking your every move on the web. GREAT EXTENSION!!!
-------------------------
block
Seriously, I wish that this was available on Windows 8.1 to block ads on Windows 8 apps. I recommend this to everyone I know. (when they ask)
-------------------------
block
The app/extension was working perfectly.  all youtube, facebook, forum, and even pandora adds were blocked.  then this week, all the ads came back... tried uninstalling and reinstalling and still not working right.  IF not for this latest.. 'hiccup' i'd give this 5 stars no hesitation.
-------------------------
block
After just blocking my 76,551st ad with it, I'd say it's done a pretty good job.
-------------------------
block
It used to perform better, but now it blocks   only part of the ads.
There are better adblock apps for Chrome - I compared it in the same session to adblock 2.6.18 and the later was much more efficient in blocking ads and jumping windows.
-------------------------
block
Very well done. It blocks what needs to be block.
-------------------------
block
Great extension even blocks ads on pandora and youtube !!!
-------------------------
block
this is also alow add for money , use asblock for complete add blocking , PAKISTAN 1
-------------------------
block
Great app but no longer blocking youtube ads :(
-------------------------
block
Great for blocking annoying ads!
-------------------------
block
Wow!! Works like a charm. Doing stuff on the internet is so much faster now that every time I want to watch a video I don't have to sit through or delete multiple ads, and every time I read an article I don't get pop ups blocking my view. My only regret is not having known about this earlier.
-------------------------
block
It's just so good...

I block all of da ads.
-------------------------
block
Works wonderfully. Sometimes you need to use a computer that doesn't have adblock plus to really appreciate the annoying stuff it blocks for you.
-------------------------
block
Amazing extension, but often buggy/inefficient. Nevertheless it's a free, safe tool that blocks 98% of ads, and I'm extremely grateful for its existence.
-------------------------
block
This is must-have for all people who hate ads. If you're thinking that this will slow your Computer down, it will do the opposite! This has taken off MANY annoying ads. Most of the time, you must like a AdBlock-Type Extension's Facebook, or share to people, this ones completely Free of charge. No fees, No Mal-Ware. And of course, no Hidden-Fees! This is a free to use Extension that will change your whole web surfing experience. My AdBlock had blocked over 24,000 ads! Think of that! Make this the best decision of your life!
-------------------------
block
Didn't do that well. went back to old add block.. this just about allowed everything.
-------------------------
block
Wonderful tool that has allowed me to be 100% add free ever since I've had it(pop-ups; banners and youtube preface ads) but recently, around 2/18/14 I had noticed more ads appearing that had always been blocked by ABP intruding into the sites I visit (eg. youtube); I suspect that advertising firms have been able to circumvent this application, and I would really like to see that this app be updated (and if possible, regularly) to keep up with the currently unblockable ads of the ever increasing insidiousness of advertisers around the web.
-------------------------
block
This is the one you want. Excellent blocking of video ads.  especially on Olympic coverage. love it.
-------------------------
block
This is the most useful extension that I've seen so far! And it's easy to use - you just add some of the preset filters, which are divided by country. You can also easily block ads, which are not in the filters. I definitely recommend AdBlock+!
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus is very helpful for children to block adult ads and to consumpts internet charges.
-------------------------
block
AMAZING!!! Always blocks every single add on ANY website and you can finally use the internet without any annoying adds! Props to the creator!!!!
-------------------------
block
This is awesome, now I don't have to face those stupid ads on youtube. But I wish this would block audio ads on Spotify too. Other than that this is perfect!
-------------------------
block
It is a great app and extension that simply blocks Ads(google adsense) from websites i surf on daily basis.
-------------------------
block
Adblock Plus is my favorite extension by far. I love knowing too that I'm using open source software, which is working on a larger scale to make the internet better for users.

For all those wondering, this extension is better than the Chrome extension simply called "Adblock." This one offers some additional flexibility and features, has a cleaner interface, and is the fruit of the original advertisement blocking project (plus it's open source!). "Adblock" on the other hand, is someone trying to take advantage of this project by ripping the open source code, and then begging for donations.
-------------------------
block
this is the best extension ever. there are no ads on pirate bay or facebook. it averages 65 ads blocked on facebook everytime i go on
-------------------------
block
Works very well. And I'm glad I have the option to not block ads on certain sites, and even more importantly, to allow some non-intrusive advertising on all sites, which I hope will help keep the web mostly free while at the same time curbing the horrible ads that make some sites unbearable. Nice job, devs.
-------------------------
block
755,254 Ads blocked by this Noble Prize worthy piece of software. This lifesaver has saved my visual cortex from having to process a gazillion gigabytes of advertisements. I'm in the developers of this software debt. For the newbs, you have to select and download a filter list. I use Easy and Adblock custom. In addition if you view the "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" list, select, copy, and paste it in to "Add your own filters" Chrome will be hitting 88 mph and you'll be seeing some plutonium speeds!
-------------------------
block
No longer blocks anything..Was the best thing ever. Someone fix this please.
-------------------------
block
It was great, but it's not blocking anything anymore. Please update :)

EDIT: I reinstalled ABP and it's working fine now!
-------------------------
block
It blocks unwanted ads most of the time and I am loving it specially the youtube ads before the videos which annoys most of the people. We are in youtube to see the videos not the adds.
I am loving it:))))
-------------------------
block
Blocks nothing
-------------------------
block
Does not seem to block pop-up ads for me when I visit certain websites. Other than that, I love it. Even tells you how many ads its blocked in your history of using it. ^-^
-------------------------
block
Great but not blocking as much as it used to
-------------------------
block
I've been using Adblock plus on many sites and many devices over the years now. 

One thing Adblock Plus needs to incorporate is the blocking of pop-unders. It's 2014 and time to get with the program.
-------------------------
block
Absolutely essential to block out those pesky ads. I love this extension therefore kudos to the creator. Great Job!
-------------------------
block
WOW I can't believe how many ads have been blocked by this extension. Every time I go to a website, I keep seeing the amount of ads that have been blocked and I'm still shocked. I can cruise through the web without waiting anymore. Although I can't seem to stop ads on Hulu, I don't mind. But I feel like 99 percent of the time this thing works great! Even blocks the ads on facebook! WOW. I'm donating money to them right now. Thank you for the amazing service/ extension you've created. I really appreciate it!
-------------------------
block
This extension is really the best AdBlocker.
I've heard loads of complaints about their AdBlocker blocking their videos, bugging out an not blocking anything.. Not for AdBlock Plus! It has always worked 100% since the beggining!
-------------------------
block
Works well, but it seems slow and Chrome keeps hanging up on "Waiting for extension Adblock Plus."  Would also be nice to see a list of what ads were blocked instead of just a count.
-------------------------
block
Works fine for me. I've used this adblocker ever since I found out they existed, and it hasn't let me down. I love the feature 'block element' to get rid of those little ads that websites try to sneak past this.
-------------------------
block
This App Help Me alot. it blocked all the youtube adds and all other adds.
-------------------------
block
Excellent extension and I really like the (opt-out) exception made for non-intrusive adverts. My only complaint would be that the firstrun screen has useful configuration options which don't appear in the main program options.

Even more useful would be a way to see how many items were blocked by each list, thus allowing you to eliminate lists which weren't pulling their weight.
-------------------------
block
it block all the ads i hate 
i really hate popups so it works well blocking those too
-------------------------
block
Really helps with browser security. Blocks all other popups that google misses
-------------------------
block
Blocks Pandora ads- YES!
-------------------------
block
Good stuff - ESPECIALLY for watching sports and other TV programs that you cannot get in your part of the world (such as NFL football in SouthEast Asia) - blocks annoying AND SOMETIMES DANGEROUS pop-ups nicely!!
-------------------------
block
It is good to have an option to block those annoying ads o youtube. Ads on Youtube make me feel like not watching anything.
-------------------------
block
It blocks some ads but many still go through. The original Adblock is better IMO.
-------------------------
block
Ok for everybody else who noticed it stopped blocking youtube ads, uninstall and re-install it. I just did it, it worked for me IJS...
-------------------------
block
It's Awesome.. blocks all annoying ads when i browse....
-------------------------
block
Perfect for any browsing.  Keep an eye on it when you're experiencing website problems though, it may be protecting you from popups you're attempting to produce.  Simply allow that site through the block temporarily (or permanently!) and you're golden.  I'd recommend this anyone.
-------------------------
block
Needs the ability to block items on page as well as ads.
-------------------------
block
Works like a charm most of the time, some ads don't seem to be blocked, but for the most part it's reliable. It stops Video ads so if you spend long hours browsing Youtube like me you'll love this.
-------------------------
block
Does it's job without too much user interaction. Love it! This and a custom hosts file is almost a perfect way to block all unwanted adds and pop-ups.
-------------------------
block
This is so awesome! I've blocked over 6500 ads!
-------------------------
block
Stopped blocking ads for me within the last few days, but i went into the options (from extensions page) and realized i needed to add a filter 'subscription' (Easylist) again. not sure why it went away, but for anybody confused about seeing ads, try this! BTW, adblock plus makes the internet a wonderful place, thanks so much for all your effort devs. ALL CREDIT GOES TO BRAD LORENZEN
-------------------------
block
I love it! Blocks all those annoying ads on stuff like piratebay, and even youtube! I give this 5 out of 5 stars.
-------------------------
block
Best Blocking Software, I recommend it all Ad haters
-------------------------
block
Works great in blocking ads when opening a web site.
-------------------------
block
Good riddance utube ads! I wonder why google allows this thing when its blocking its own ads
I hope they don't notice
-------------------------
block
Not blocking the annoying video ads on Youtube most of all, but it's not blocking any other ads either anymore. Used to work wonderfully.
-------------------------
block
Awesome extension,great for blocking unwanted and un needed popups!
-------------------------
block
Does what it is supposed to. Very Good! Although it used to block Youtube ads, but I guess youtube updated their stuff. Still, this is still a good blocker

This is the best extension in the store! Blocks ads on YouTube, Facebook, and any other site you are surfing.
-------------------------
block
I don't even know how did you guys manage to block the youtube ads but it's pure genius! Love it!
-------------------------
block
Has been brilliant since I downloaded it. Now it is not very efficient on some pages for whatever reason. Worked ok last night on another pc, but on the chromebook, it's not blocking ads any more. When it works, it's great.
-------------------------
protect
It helps not only against intrusive ads but to protect privacy as well. Thank you.
-------------------------
prevent
It's a very helpful app to prevent unwanted advertisement. I love this app. And recommended    to other to use it frequently.
-------------------------
block
Amazing! The reason I was looking for this is because, I'm not sure when, ad-ware got into my computer. Lucky for me, this blocks it!
-------------------------
block
nice one form all add block for every sites
-------------------------
block
Amazing add-on! It automatically blocks ads on the page. Always gives u a clean page. Love it.
-------------------------
block
very useful application and blocks each and every    ad.very happy with this app. love it
-------------------------
block
Amazing Adblocker! Blocks  all ads before page loads!
-------------------------
block
Never had a problem with it. Does exactly what it promises. It blocks ads all over the web. I'm quite pleased.
-------------------------
block
Blocks almost all the annoying ads on many good websites!
Awesonw!
-------------------------
detect
Really amazing. I don't have problems with ads getting through. But I do have certain websites that detect the extension and make me wait longer to stream videos and such. But other than that, pretty great!
-------------------------
block
Blocks ads for youtube and when watching tv shows on various websites. It is very nice. It does not stop your browsing data from being recorded. If you ask it too block them, it does some. Ghostely does the rest for me. Between the two, you have a lot of control over what advertisement companies can do to and "for you."
-------------------------
block
I haven't noticed any problems with the app as of yet all in all it seems to be a very good ad blocking extension.
-------------------------
block
Though I haven't found one of the top tier ad block extensions I didn't appreciate, I feel this extension edges slightly ahead of the rest.  The completeness of the program like the ability to remove the temptation of tweet/like buttons on websites (that track your browsing habits) is unmatched.

Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
I hate adds! now I don't have to boycot every annoying brand that violates my eyes! Thank you oh creator of add block
-------------------------
block
been using it for years now.... by far the best ad blocking there will ever be, across all platforms you want to use!
-------------------------
block
it is better than adblock because it blocks ads and pop up windows in sumotorrent.
-------------------------
block
Was great and my favorite service for blocking ads but now its blocking my entire Google+ page and feeds.
-------------------------
block
Doing an excellent job blocking ads.
-------------------------
block
Blocks every advert on every website.
-------------------------
block
Awesome blocks all ads
-------------------------
block
love it more than any other ad block extension. much faster too, and doesn't slow down browsing. great to have!
-------------------------
block
I'll tell you, this is the best AD blocking extension that I've come across. It really demolishes that "ads not by this site" vermin! I never write reviews... BUT I HAD TO WRITE THIS ONE... It's that good.
-------------------------
block
Adblock used to be a great extension, blocking all ads. Now, Google is paying them to display ads on YouTube. Great, Adbloc, just great.
-------------------------
block
Ads blocked.
Thank you.
-------------------------

Whip the damned block, great!

This is really good, blocks for everything, and easy to disable if I really really wanted, recommended to my friends and family :)

Dear all, 

My name is Job Plas, and I am the Project Manager for Adblock Plus. Due to a bug, YouTube video ads have been showing for everyone using an adblocker (not only Adblock Plus).

We're happy to announce that we fixed this, and that Adblock Plus is now the only Chrome extension which blocks all annoying YouTube video ads again!

Happy browsing from the ABP team :) 

Best, 
Job

BLOCK THE YOUTUBE ADS!!
-------------------------
block
awesome and has blocked over 50,000 adds in less then a year. and one time 27 adds on one facebook page!  love it
-------------------------
block
really nice, also blocks a lot of spam that constantly comes up
-------------------------
block
Best add block out there, I tried using a different shotty one before and this is leagues better.
-------------------------
block
no more blocking of YT ads D:< OUTRAGEOUS
-------------------------
block
Much better than the other ones out there. These has even blocked my Pandora ads for a long time.
-------------------------
block
blocks more content than regular adblock
-------------------------
block
Love it! Works with every thing except youtube lately. Even when trying to manually add a block of ads from youtube- it blocks the youtube player window completely. Needs an update- that's the only downside.
-------------------------
block
Best ad block EVER! Have had it a year or so!
-------------------------
block
it works just fine reinstall it if the ads stop blocking
-------------------------
block
Very nice additional blocking features added.
Goes beyond the adblock plus plug-in used in Firefox. Well done.
-------------------------
block
There is a Russian drop down ad that is not blocked if you have Image Hover Zoom.  Please fix this.  Love your extension.
-------------------------
block
blocks everything =]
-------------------------
block
ABP used to be a solid program that did exactly what I wanted: blocked all ads on pages I was viewing.

In the last few months more and more ads have been getting through and now I wonder what ABP does any more. It looks like I'm running a program and using system resources for a plugin that does next to nothing.

Come on team: grow some balls and deliver what we actually want!
-------------------------
block
I've been using this add-on for years, I love it. I couldn't imaging browsing the web without it. Truly makes my browsing experience much more enjoyable. Also, if you're having problems with it not blocking some  things you need to manually update your block lists.
-------------------------
block
Love it! Continue blocking away!!!!!
-------------------------
block
Great way to block all those annoying ads and yet still allow some ads on site which you want to support. The internet would be a better place if people didn't abuse the use of ads.
-------------------------
block
I must say i am very impressed. I have tried many other adblockers but this one must be the best one i have ever discovered it blocks youtube ads facebook ads and every ad that does ever exist. Definitely what i got promised.Great work!
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block all adds on websites I visit. Adblock is much better.
-------------------------
block
Just love it! Block all those annoying ads!
-------------------------
block
I love that you can remove any form of ad yourself if it is not blocked already
it makes google chrome a lot more enjoyable, thank you Ad Block Plus!
-------------------------
block
blocks every ad that gave me problems :)
-------------------------
block
it is the best application that you will ever find....it blocks all anonymous advertisements tht eatup your bandwidth
-------------------------
block
Great extension and a must have. Easily allows you to create your own filters and block just about anything.
-------------------------
block
its epic, blocks ads, just hope its safe, but reviews are fine SO YEAH
-------------------------
block
love it i see it block adds from websites
-------------------------
block
NICE! IT BLOCKS ALL UNWANTED ADS!
-------------------------
block
I love this app its really helpful; You can't go wrong! It doesn't slow down your computer, and it blocks ads! What isn't there to love?
-------------------------
block
Does exactly what I need, blocks ads. Simple and doesn't slow down my browser. Highly recommend.
-------------------------
block
I love AdBlock Plus! I had it on Firefox and it was great at keeping 95% of the pop-ups at bay, and 100% keeping stupid sidebar ads on facebook and yahoo away. I was hoping they made an extension for chrome when I made the switch, imagine my delight! :) I fully endorse AdBlock Plus!

*UPDATE* I still love ABP, but on facebook, it only intermittently blocks the sponsored ads :/ Hopefully, they find a permanent fix to this.
-------------------------
block
I used adblock before this.. but it rather slowed down my PC.. but when i installed this i gotta know that it has malware,tracker,ad blocking features. Man i like this!!works almost same as adblock but it has more functions to do so its ok.
-------------------------
block
an open source initiation so helpful fr blocking ads.....
-------------------------
block
really helpful, blocks annoying ads, absolutely love it
-------------------------
block
Perfect blocks all those pesky ads on the internet!
-------------------------
prevent
Probably the most valuable extension/addon available to prevent adware and malware being snuck in via phony ads and "re-directs" links in websites.  No more annoying ads overlaying videos in Youtube.  GET THIS NOW, especially if you frequent the "watch full movies for free" websites.
-------------------------
block
Blocks every ad that I would have normally noticed and works perfectly fine I have found.
-------------------------
block
Does a great job of blocking the stupid ads that block the screen when streaming sports etc. Sorts the problem right out.
-------------------------
block
I love this program, I've had no issues with it and it does what it promises. It also allows you to customize what you want blocked or not! Amazing!
-------------------------

the best app for blocking ads...
-------------------------

blocks the annoying ads,banners and saves data usage. awesome app.

Very useful app. THANKS EVERYONE who was involved in making this. This blocks almost all the ads and popups that bother us! Thanks again

How to block flash and swf ?
-------------------------
block
The best adblocker on the planet! Be sure to add all the available block lists; they're not installed/turned on by default.
-------------------------
block
The extension as is is great and awesome but they use this now to make money... with ads that aren't getting blocked.

Read about it on mobilegeeks.
-------------------------
block
I recommend getting this, you'll love it. Blocks all those pesky, annoying ads.
-------------------------
block
blocks stuff!
-------------------------
block
I have nothing bad to say about it! It blocks every single ad I have seen, including the ones before YouTube videos. A great extension to have!
-------------------------
prevent
it did a good job from preventing ads from domain!
-------------------------
block
Doesn't do it's job properly as ad's pop up all over the place. Do yourself a favour and use Adblock instead of Plus as that app blocks everything all the time!
-------------------------
block
Brilliant. Never had issues. Always blocks adds, and when using another computer I am shocked to see all adds come back! That makes me run to this app again :P
-------------------------
block
Truly blocks ads. Reduces your bandwidth. Thank you developer :)
-------------------------
block
I have noticed that it does indeed block all ads.  I have never had any ads on any computer I use Google Chrome on.  I say this is the best Ad-blocker because it does not slow the computer unlike some others.
-------------------------
block
Not blocking ads nowadays. Getting lot of ads on youtube!
-------------------------
block
Works great. Best ad blocking software out there.
-------------------------
block
Have yet to see an ad since ad block was installed. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
It never failed, always blocked annoying ads, and didn't even glitch. Perfect.
-------------------------
block
Best ad blocker ever!

And to the people that say it doesn't block some ads, if you click on the ABP icon you can click and add it to the filter and BAM that ad doesn't show again
-------------------------
block
Can't surf without it. Using on OSX Snow Leopard 10.6.8 - block everything, never a single hiccup. Using close to 1 year now.
-------------------------
block
Almost perfect! Been using ABP for a year and only twice has it had a relapse and stoped blocking ads. Cant sem to figure out why, any ideas?

Works great with ALL facebook suggestions :D
-------------------------
block
This is a pretty cool app . Does what it said it will do block all unwanted ads simple and useful
-------------------------
block
i love how this app blocks everything <3 5 stars! *****

blocks everything!!

bypass
Generally awesome app, though, it looks like FB has just figured out how to bypass the filters again. :(
-------------------------

This extension does block  most ads but does not block all adds in YouTube which is not that great.
Overall, a great addition  to your browser.
-------------------------

It works magically! Really does work to block every single ad there is!

By far, the bast ad blocking plugin you can have on your Chrome browser. Period.

Now, pages load faster, because before ad block plus, the page would load in 7 seconds, and ads 15.  i used to think the internet would be like this forever. but NOT ANY MORE!

Even blocks ads on pandora, what more can a person ask for, and its free free free baby!

Wow this app is cool.  It cleans up all the annoying adds on every site and makes them load faster.  Even blocks the stupid youtube ads at the start of videos.  Thanks!

The best ad blocking solution for Chrome and Firefox. The other popular ad block extension hijacks your browser home page, and each time re-directs to their home page asking for donation.
-------------------------
block
what more do you expect from an ad blocking app?
-------------------------
block
I strongly prefer the Adblock Plus approach of blocking annoying ads will allowing ads that are not annoying (e.g. do not consume cpu resources, etc.).

This encourages all the websites that must depend on advertising to prefer well behaved, non-annoying, static ads.

All ad blockers should follow the lead of Adblock Plus in encouraging responsible and considerate advertisements.
-------------------------

Works great. Blocks all those annoying adds. I hate them dearly. Great product.

Thanks! its great, but doesn't block "EVERY" ad.

I recommend this if you want every typ of pop blocked. works for me
-------------------------

Hands down one of the best extensions available. Blocks YouTube ads, search ads, dashboard ads, Pandora ads (on and off), ads of literally every single type. The one improvement that could be made is some way to show if a full-page ad has been blocked; it is sometimes unclear whether a large ad is blocked or the page simply fails to load.

Simple and straight forward, blocks ads and let's you do what you want with no distractions.

ABSOLUTELY AWESOME...

It's so good that it's gotten to the point where it's manditory. And the best part? look up the "Allow some non-intrusive ads" I always hated thinking I am standing in the way of some of my favorite small websites from making income by blocking their ads, but thanks to this feature, they can allow their ads to get through as long as they aren't obnoxious. Seriously, good job.

This works great. I tried a different Ad Block but it was terrible, but this just kicked it in the face. I swear, I haven't seen a single ad since I've installed this.
-------------------------

5 Stars, awesome extension. Blocks any ads   that I wanted to block, or the already specified filters that you guys made. I made my own filters but never released them to the public, because I felt the need they needed more  ads to be blocked. 

This is really good if you can't find a way to block ads, but I think you should add a survey remover to this. It might be nice for everyone to see a survey remover that works :) .

Pretty good plugin, I'm hoping that you took my suggestions.

Thanks,

Really before I was using tamper monkey scripts to achieve half of its functionality. No it is one place solution.

Adblock Plus is a fantastic tool and add-on for Firefox, it allows you to block internet ads, block un-wanted images, which generally speeds up loading time on websites. 
It's easy to configure and has a set list of known ad suppliers to block so you don't have to input anything.

I don't like the fact that it doesn't work as well a it does in FF. The ads actually load, and I can see them for a second, and then they disappear. The FF version prevents them from loading completely. Still nice though. 4/5

Google Chrome is THE best browser. Google, I am hypnotized by your products... They are simple, dependable, and most importantly, your products are mostly free while still offering a gigantic variety of products and services that people depend upon from day to day. I must admit, even my beloved phone is a Google Android... My iPhone was water damaged in a sea kayaking capsize (the dry-bag was not appropriately closed) and I have been much happier with my Droid! Adblock, you are delightful and you pair with Chrome to(somehow?) create an even smoother browsing experience. Well, it's obviously because of the blocked advertisements. I am devout to both Google and AdBlock. Yesterday I opened my Firefox browser for the first time since reformatting my laptop. It was messy, slow, spammy, something Chrome was not before installing these extensions and applications. After installing the same extensions in Firefox and testing it out for a night, I gave up and quickly ran back into the comforting arms of Google Chrome! Firefox was horrifying. I had to remove so many toolbars and search engines, specifically YAHOO!, that I never installed. No other person has the keys to my laptop either... I always specify "NO" when installing programs that ask. These toolbars were never present within my Chrome and it was my first time opening Firefox since its initial installation. Firefox was a boggy nightmare. Thank you, Google, for so many privileges. I do not take these for granted. Customer service is supreme from my experiences compared to other websites. Considering the overload Google has, it is astonishing to me. Google even pays me! How much more could I, or anyone for that matter, ask of Google?

While not quite as robust as NoScript in Firefox, AdBlock Plus adds major security (and removes annoyance) from Chrome. Removing adverts not only makes the page cleaner, but can also help prevent "drive-by" attacks from infected web sites. 

Please support the developers of this excellent and necessary tool!

While I loved Adblock Plus for Firefox, I don't like it for Chrome. I had to recently switch browsers and got Chrome versions of all my addons (or very similar in function equivalents), and I'm not impressed with how this one works. A lot of advertisement went through, if I right-click to block an ad, nothing happens, and nothing gets put into the custom filter. It was honestly a much more reliable addon for firefox and much simpler  there as well.

I switched to the other "Adblock" addon, and I have to say that it does the job I require and it is so much simpler to add custom filters, and it uses all the same filters (EasyList, Fanboy, etc) as this one!

Best ad blocker for chrome. Better than adblock. Adblock doesn't block all ads and also does emotional blackmails showing the donate banner. Adblock plus (this app) is far far better.
-------------------------
block
Best free ad blocker available. Does slow down the page but only ever slow slighty, others freeze the page for a up to 5-10 seconds, the ones that don't, don't block the ad. The updates aren't obtrusive either like some other chrome apps. 9.5/10 from me.
-------------------------
block
Works great.  When I log into my other email accounts it even blocks the ads that run along the side.  Prevents my computer from slowing down since it keeps all the scripts from running.  Worth downloading!
-------------------------
block
Works quickly and efficiently. But no longer blocks audio ads on Pandora (though I can skip them atleast) and now I see some side ads on Facebook, including recommended pages. This was not so before. Either those sites adapted or Chrome update changed the effectiveness of ADP Beta. Good overall. though.
-------------------------

Really good for blocking stupid ads. love it.

It is great compared to "adblock"  the version without plus at the end. This version blocks everything including video commercials.

This is the real Adblock Plus for Chrome. Adblock is completely independent and while competent I personally find it never quite meets the complete standards of Adblock Plus. While not quite as powerful as it's Firefox older brother it gets the job done and also does a flawless job of blocking those annoying YouTube streaming ads. If the occasional text ad happens to slip through (never seen it myself. Have a heart and let them display. Sites need to make their revenue somehow and so long as the ads aren't intrusive (banner, video, flash animation etc) then there's nothing to really complain about.
-------------------------
block
Love it, and I love how you can set the level of blocking.
-------------------------

Best add blocker that I know of! I used to use it in Firefox and it worked great, now in chrome only a few things have changed; it's still the best one by far. Though it's not as good as the Firefox version, It still blocks all the adds on every website I've been on without blocking good content (it even works for GrooveShark!)
-------------------------

Does what it's supposed to best: blocks ads and possible malicious content, even when it is a false positive!  Thanks, developer!

I love this extension ... the only thing I think that needs corrected is the fact that when you start Chrome and the previous session loads the extension doesn't block the adware before loading the pages.

It works great pretty much EVERYWHERE except Livestream and Facebook. It prevents me from seeing a Livestream so I have to turn it off on Livestream and go through video ads. No big deal really.

But Facebook ads are an issue. I notice a lot of them are coming through. That needs to be fixed. Otherwise, awesome extension. Haven't seen an annoying ad anywhere (except Facebook and Livestream) in a long time. It's especially awesome on YouTube.

THIS IS JUST GREAT! Even though video sharing sites talk about disabling, ad block still disables ads on videos and what I mean is I forgot my hulu password so i was watching a video for free and something came up saying please enable ads, this is just great!

I love this so much. It totally blocks the ads, I have forgotten that they were ever there! I really recommend this. One time, it did cause chrome to crash, though. Once.

Add the right click blocking option... else works fine

Speaking as someone who uses both regularly for nearly the same functions, I agree with a previous reviewer - for some reason, Adblock Plus is WAY more effective at blocking ads in Chrome than Firefox. Even video ads on sites like YouTube, DailyMotion, etc get blocked, in addition to the regular annoying pop-ups/sidebar ads/etc. Highly recommend it!
-------------------------

Hey "Adblock" is good than "Adblock Plus" because "Adblock plus" is blocking google's knowledge graph results.

So, i hope u'll fix it.

So far, I have found this to be a very good extension. It blocks almost all ads on the websites I visit. My only problem is that sometimes there will be these large gaps on the sides of web pages were the ad banners used to be. But then again, it's better than the ads.

Overall, great extension.

This is the ad blocking extension you want.

Adblock Plus (Beta) for Chrome is not as powerful as its Firefox companion, but it is continuously improving. At first release, video ad blocking was spotty but it is now nearly on par with its Firefox companion. Video ad blocking works far better compared to the other popular Adblock extension in the Chrome Web Store. 

Banner ads and in-line text ads blocking work very well. I do allow ads from some of my favorite sites where the ad placements aren't overwhelming understanding that is how they raise revenue.
-------------------------

My review being I've had a lot of problems with ads I thought it might be a virus because they were popping up in my FB messages and blocking all side videos related to a video i may have been watching on youtube (BTW I use Chrome) so I just got this and it worked wonders now there are no ads my videos are not lagging by them no ads in my messages it was fantastic And my side videos are now there again..there is sometime a blank box where an ad should be but i think that  may be the virus i may have even so nothings in the box everything else is fantastic Thank you for this so much!

OMG Thank you.  I don't care if its perfect, it allows me to custom block ads that I cant stand (like auto-playing flash video ads).

I have found this to be, BY FAR, the best ad blocker out there. I've never had an issue with it, the ability to add your own filters is simply fantastic, block certain things on websites from loading, it is so versatile and works brilliantly, i recommend it to everybody i know. Simply Brilliant.

My God people stop complaining so much.  This is a great extension. No way its going to block 100% of the ads, the ad agencies will always find ways to bypass this.  Be greatful that it works well.  This extension is awesome, makes browsing the web so much better.

Fantastic addition.  I've had no problems whatsoever with Adblock Plus.  It now hurts my eyes to browse the web on other computers/browsers who do not have this add on.  

It is also VERY easy to block customer adds/images in the (rare) case of ABP not catching certain adds.

This should really come standard with all browsers.

I used Ad Block Plus with Firefox and I loved it.  This one works well but doesn't block all of the advertisements in video sites like South Park Studios and Hulu, for example.  It still works well, but that's one thing that the firefox version has over this one for Chrome.  If this could be fixed it would be fantastic and I'd give this app five stars.  Thank you!

EASILY the best ad-blocker I've ever found. Wanna block a specific element you don't like on a page? The feature to do so is readily available, just a few clicks, then bam, you have access to block anything possible. Wanna stop ad-blocking because you want to give a few cents to a kind stranger? Done, with nothing but a click within the menu. I definitely recommend getting it, because it not only works incredibly well, but others have mentioned how they've been using it for years without a problem in other reviews, and I've found proof of that firsthand. Not a single ad, no weirdness, nothing; it's genuinely near flawless. Easiest 10/10 of my LIFE.

Edit: yeah, I was right, I just didn't know how right I was. For any who somehow stumble across this review, if you have something like those premium subscription pop-ups that sometimes slip through, you can block those as well using the built-in feature. Just click the block option in the menu that pops up when you click on the extension next to the search bar at the top, and hover over what you want to block, then move the mouse around the general area until it highlights the full part of what you want to block, including its background. If you're having trouble going back to the normal page and you have been blocked from interacting with it, then you can open a new tab (or duplicate it), reload your current one, or press the back button. There's also an option to un-block something in the settings if you wish to do so, although you can just fully disable ad blocking for the specific page you're on within that same menu that you used earlier.

Bye bye stupid ads! No more video ads or 'acceptable' ads! ABP has blocked so many annoying ads that I don't ever want to see again.

A tip: Turn on the Anti Adblock Block filter in Settings and teach the money-hungry websites a lesson by disabling their "disable your adblocker" pop-ups!

I downloaded ABP!  It's free to download and use, and when I can, I donate what I'm able, and I really appreciate that
it's so nice that there's no pressure.
I recommend ABP, and will continue to do so!
Thanks for all you do to stop these annoying ads!

I've tried out several ad blockers including my browser's built in adblocker but nothing beats AdblockPlus. It keeps adds, those pesky push notifications and irritating cookie warnings that take up half the article you're reading, away. Unfortunately, pop-ups DO get through and my virus guard start screaming. Other than that, it's an absolute treasure and I highly recommend ABP to anyone.
-------------------------
popup
Wonderful! 
I don't need something fancy for my ad-blocking needs - just a dependable, reliable workhorse of an extension. Adblock Plus definitely fills that niche for me; no annoying ads, no popups, nothing. Browsing the web has never been such fun!

ALWAYS. FREE. I trust in the honor system and you've paid off. You have the service the people want, and you're winning!

No more frustration from pop-ups, easy to turn off for sites that won't work with ad block apps and continues to block junk from the rest.

I hate when companies use their website to track what you do elsewhere. This add on is a must have for those that wish to avoid annoying ads or to avoid giving your personal info out BECAUSE THIS ONE WORKS!!! Nothing out there that is better than AdBlock + that I am aware of and even if there was I probably would stick with AB+ because they are trustworthy and have proven that since they started. Not many tech companies out there that can say that and actually be telling you the truth.

literally saved me from countless ads and popups very very satisfied and happy with the perfornance

very good , blocking most ads but need a pop-up blocker and update to block ads on Facebook and YouTube
-------------------------
annoy
This service works really well for most websites. On YouTube, however, skippable ads, shown as pictures with the advertising company, a message, and a button to go to said advertiser's website, still show. However, they are guaranteed to be skippable immediately, and they aren't even videos. Still annoying, but it is better. It also allows you to remove ANY element from ANY page, which is very helpful in different cases, even if the element is or is part of an ad. I'd recommend this to anyone.

Very helpful and not at all annoying. Recommend to a lot of people who are annoyed with ads blocking view and being confusing. I also like that I can still see some if I want to that I like. I love that it's free too and that google allows it for a lot of dumb websites instead of having to tediously tell each website them self to cut down on the amount of ads they show. It also helps my computer run things faster and I can have enough tabs open for my work. Super good.

This app is awesome, and makes my experience very well. I had this for almost one year from now. It helped me avoid all those annoying ads on YouTube, and it saves time. The bad thing about it is when it suddenly stops working, and I have to re-install it to make it work again. It doesn't block every single ad, but it blocks most ads and all the ads that need to be blocked. This extension is one of the extensions I would recommend to people, but it would be nice to support people by disabling it.

Ive used Adblock for years. It is virtually invisible, my screen is clean and readable. If adblocking annoys anyone, they inform me and I refresh Adblock. Simple for an older person who is impatient with ads for all kinds of things I no longer need.

Very helpful against those annoying ads. One thing I would add is a way to keep those new agencies from telling you "turn off your AdBlock." IMO it's annoying. Otherwise a must have for internet users.

I was pretty skeptical since I've never used an ad blocker before and I wasn't exactly sure how it would even work. My intention was simply to get rid of the annoying pop-ups that would appear over youtube videos, but I had no idea that it would actually stop commercials from playing when watching any online video, as well! This is incredible! All I had to do was download and the ad-blocker just worked on it's own. I didn't even have to worry about downloading malware with it, like most online downloads. This is amazing!
-------------------------
annoy
I've been desperately trying to get an ad blocker. All the ads I'm getting is first thing annoying, and my computer keeps getting glitchy from all the ads. Finally, it's way less glitchy and no more annoying ads. I appreciate this ad blocker a lot. Highly recommend to use, and it's freeeeeeeee. So definitely use it!

Works wonders for me, YouTube was the reason I decided to get this extension and it works as though YouTube doesn't have any ads. Another great thing I found while on the web was that the sites that usually have those pop-up ads and the ones that show up in the bottom right of the screen are gone. I've had this extension for about a year now and it works all the time and doesn't slow down my computer. I have an AMD ryzen 5 1400 and 16gb of 3200hz ram. Its better than some computers, however its not the best computer. Either way I know for a fact that most computers can run this extension because I had seen a lot of people complaining about that.

it gets rid of the annoyance that is now becoming overwhelming on the majority of websites.

I have been using ABP for years and it is a fantastic tool that has made using the internet much easier for me and I enjoy being in control of what sites I can whitelist.  I almost never see annoying pop ups and I love that I do not see advertising while watching YouTube videos.  I highly recommend this tool.  I was using this in Safari and just added it to Chrome since I have the newest version of Safari, and it honestly is not playing well with some websites I visit (website owners are not up to speed with the technology and are telling me to use other browsers), so I am using Chrome on my Mac more frequently.  I will also be downloading this for Edge if it is available (for my laptop).  Thanks for a great extension!

Not sure if you've found a replacement by now, but my recommendation has always been ublock origin (make sure it has origin in its name). It's simply the best blocker out there, hands down. Never experienced a single issue, not once, and it blocks absolutely everything. While at the same time giving you total control of exactly what, when, & where to block, if you choose to do so (optional, it works fine default). It's also the lightest on resources, speeding everything up instead of bogging it down. You can also add/enable/check additional filter lists in its settings. There's even one (or a few) that gets rid of all those annoying "disable adblocker" messages you were referring to.
-------------------------
annoy
It gets the job done. No hassle, no ads, easy surfing. Some websites are annoying and force you to whitelist it, but other than that, has been my favorite extension for years.

It even stops ads before you play on online video games.  I love this extension.  It does what I want it to do.  If a website gets picky about you using it, just click on the ABP icon and tick disable for this site.  Then un-tick when your done.  Thank you so much for this.  One very grateful user :D  And note:  I noticed some people said it stopped working, not for me and I used it for around 3 years now.

I really love Adblock Plus!

It automatically blocks almost every advertisement, even the annoying popup ones on YT videos. It also makes pages load a lot faster on my outdated computer which is a huge plus.

One feature that I really like is being able to whitelist individual websites so AB+ won't block their ads. That gives me the ability to support websites that I like by allowing them to earn a little ad revenue from me. It also makes me feel like I have a lot more control over my privacy.

It would be great to have a few different 'skins'(?) for it!

ABP has really gone downhill. uBlock Origin is much more effective. 

Now that ABP accepts money from a couple large conglomerates (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Taboola) in exchange for being whitelisted, lots of ads just can't be blocked anymore. Just about ALL of the annoying video ads on youtube get through! Not to mention all the tracking happening through cookies, etc.

uBlock Origin is now a much better blocker, and uses significantly less system memory/resources as well.

Still getting a ton of pop-up windows, from a ton of scam companies, with a fresh install so no mal-ware, no viruses no nothing.

So clearly you are either taking money from these companies to add them to a back-end whitelist or they have a found a method of working around the ad-block extension and very tight chrome settings.

It Blocks Annoying Ads in Youtube And Other Websites.

Thanks For Making AdBlock Plus :)
-------------------------

Mark I agree..the Facebook ads are from Facebook and they do it.  However, I have gone in my settings and fixed them, and so can they.  AdBlockPlus is the best and I'm not paid to say this!!  
-------------------------
annoy
Blocks maybe 60 percent of ads.  Still have annoying pages open when on streaming sites, still shows the porn.  Works really well on youtube only.
-------------------------
annoy
So there was this one page that I always went to and it had pop ups and hyperlinks, it was annoying. I'd block pop ups pretty much try anything and literally just downloaded this went to the website and no ads no pop ups and no hyperlinks. love it already
-------------------------
annoy
Cleaned up a lot of annoying ads on my favorite sites.

 HIGHLY recommend, the pages don't even look the same once all the ads are gone! :D love it

loved it no virus no annoying ads

I've had ad block plus for so long, and I've loved it, it works great. But now that they're being paid to show specific ads, I'm jumping ship to ublock origins. 
I know there's a way to fix it and block all ads on abp, but I shouldn't have to.
Thanks for the years of ad blocking
Ublock origins, here I come

It was very good to avoid annoying ads, malware and tracking.
-------------------------
paid
Hey guys, if you want to block ads even if they paid to be let through, click on your extension, go to the bottom saying Options at the bottom of the GUI, and customize it there. Over all, this blocked ALL the annoying ads. Don't accuse me of being a bot. I know some things are bad about this ad blocker, but I liked it. It worked great. Possibly the best ad blocker on google anyway.
-------------------------
popup
Nice!! blocked all ads and popups perfectly and not even a single coin spended for this. Thanx so much!!

Its magically was annoyed from some ads on one website and now boom all are gone!!

ABP the best popup blockers, used it for some time and never had any issues with it, really helps with unknow websites as well

cuts out a lot of annoying ads its free it has no ads what more could you ask for

BEST OF THE WORLD. No more of those annoying ads! Yay!
-------------------------
popup
ABP is one of the best popup blockers i have ever used. straight up. i can use it and click to play java, and i hardly ever EVER get popups, even on shady websites that are nothing BUT popups. Every time i start a new pc or have to reinstall chrome, first thing i do is add ABP.
-------------------------
popup
I have both ABP & the regular AB.  I truly have never been bothered with pop-ups and I have had it for as long as it has been offered.  Add AB and see if that helps.
-------------------------
annoy
It's a very good extension, especially if you're easily annoyed by Ads and/or want to avoid getting Adware on your device. The only problem is that some Ads these days are getting past Adblock Plus, so I'm gonna rate it a 4/5 for now.
-------------------------
annoy
GOOD EXTENSION

EASY TO USE AND BLOCK ANNOYING ADDS DIRECTLY
-------------------------
annoy
I love this extension! It has helped me block those annoying ads! THANKS!
-------------------------
annoy
Ads suck.
With ABP, you get no more annoying ads. No ads on YouTube videos, websites articles, adf.ly, and if there is a specific ad or image that remains, you can manually block it. ABP is pretty great!
-------------------------
annoy
Except when it needs to be reloaded; otherwise it works so well and makes surfing pleasant without all those annoying ads.
-------------------------
annoy
It works fine! My web surfing without annoying and lagging ads improved dramatically.
-------------------------
popup
I have always had adblock and I had no problems with pop-ups but with adblock plus almost every site I visit to stream shows I am bombarded with at least 2 pop-ups/video stream many of which contain malware. The simple most popular adblock worked much better for me. thanks anyway.

This anti-ad utilities ABP this is the best of all than the other paid adblock software. thank you for making this free....

Super amazing! Its free and it really works. saved my life...and my grade. the popups and adds got so bad and make my computer so slow I could hardly move from tab to tab. I would Rate 10/5 if I could! Would DEFFINITLY recomend to friends and family!

awesome i liked it now i can see anything without this really annoying ads
-------------------------

Time to me is more precious than anything else.  Having to click away all the annoying ads, or having to waste my time watching a 30 second video that is unskippable to watch a 2 minute tutorial is absurd.  I havnt had any problems (Including youtube, it works fine for me) and this has saved me time from 30,000 ads.  

My time is worth more than the pennies the corporate giants get from me seeing their intrusive ad.
-------------------------
annoy
I just love this extension because it's blocks all the annoying ads that I don't want to see! I mean, that is what an adblocker is for, right?

Works PERFECTLY!!!!!!

To all of you who claim that AdBlock Plus is NOT doing its job - START READING BELOW!

A big thank you in advance, Elad Karako! YOU, Sir, saved me years of headaches. Wish I had discovered this years ago...

Posted by Elad Karako, Dec 4, 2015:

"1. you should remove the checkmark from "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" in the extension settings :)

2. 
also- add few other lists from this post:
http://icompile.eladkarako.com/adblock-lists/

the most intrusive ads can be blocked even before you open your browser using your computer's DNS service (google "blocking ads using HOSTS file")

anyway me and few others are maintaining a list of those bad domains (tracking, ads, popups, malware)

the lists are published at https://github.com/eladkarako/hosts.eladkarako.com
and I've added a new AdBlock list named "hosts_adblock" which is useful if you don't want to use your computer's HOSTS file, but still want to block all those ads.

it updates few times a week.
direct links:

the "hosts_adblock" list:
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts_adblock.txt

the HOSTS files:
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts0.txt
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts.txt

the plain domain list:<br>http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts_raw.txt

hope you'll find it useful, I've never saw a single ad for 3 years now :))))"

I love you Adblock plus, you get rid of those annoying youtube adds,you get rid of all those annoying "CLICK HERE FOR 1 MILLION DOLLARS" ADS, you also get rid of those startling ads that actually  have sound and are usually advertising something really loud when you are trying to chill and surf the web.

It's nice for blocking out intrusive ads, but doesn't stop scripted popups or some Flash embeds from playing.  It also slows everything to a crawl on my new computer.  It's actually slightly faster with the extension disabled!

Wouldn't be without it.

did what I wanted it to do, block all those banner ads which I find so annoying and dont like that ad companies spy on ur surfing to bring u those.TY for some speed and privacy back!

This works great. It blocks annoying ads from most websites. On top of not seeing annoying ads it also provides another level of security from rogue ads with viruses. You can allow some ads through if you choose. Ads make free sites free so I don't mind the few that make it through.

It blocks ads effectively without negative effects on your computer (as far as I can tell) but it does have a few times where ads do appear and the annoying blocked ad count (That can be disabled, but still).
I'd highly recommend for anyone who doesn't want ads on youtube or anything else, for a very cheap price.

Adblock Plus is amazing and I recommend it to everyone. It completely blocked all ads and pop-ups. I accidently clicked something that gave me a lot of pop-ups all the time, but adblock blocks it. Also in youtube, it is great to skip all the ads.

Thanks. I don't have to deal with annoying ads anymore. Thanks Adblock Plus

Works perfectly, with no problems... great tool for Internet casuals. Next step is adding hosts blocking to the PC and the Router (via DD-WRT).

If Miika Ahonen had viewed the .png in question, he'd see it's the adblock 'ads blocked' counter. If he stopped browsing the sites that were trying to rapidly pop-up ads, he wouldn't have that problem. You obviously did some work to find what your PC was doing, don't cry wolf on adblock.

I have found it the best tool to deny annoying ads on most every website I view. It sometimes blocks up to 600 plus on my Yahoo mail account in any given time frame. Just make sure that you delete it from Google Chrome if your computer needs to reboot due to new auto updates to your computer. I have found this wonderful tool likes to be informed that there was a system update. How do you know it's not working? If you don't see a single ad block at Yahoo Mail or some other site where there have been plenty of ads blocked in the past, delete the extension and reinstall it after a reboot. It's GREAT!

I only have it for one day but I must say it's doing a marvellous job! It's blocked everything, all the annoying pop up ads and ads that appear before videos or online games! Very nice!
-------------------------
annoy
no intrusive, 
distracting adverts that sap the fun out of using the internet. once in a while I'll get those annoying 10 second ads, the ones before the next video. that's my only issue with ABP, and it's small one. Thank you devs!

Very good blocker, it can  
block all the annoying ad

LOVE IT!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH for blocking all the excessive and annoying ads that were always blocking my browser and leading me to other websites when I click the 'X' button. THANK YOU ADBLOCK PLUS!! Finally! I can watch all my drama in peace! =D

Very Great! Blocks all ads for a cleaner webpage look. It's especially useful when it comes to blocking those annoying talking ads. Love this extension.
-------------------------
annoy
ABP has saved me thousands of minutes of annoying ads over the course of the year. To date it has blocked 260,000 Ads this year.
-------------------------
annoy
It blocks almost all of the ads, all of them except for the ones that came with my last adblocker... D: There were some annoying ones it didn't catch, but the create-your-own-filter is a wonderful thing and that blocked all the annoying ads. There's still one bit of in-text ads that I can't disable without getting rid of the whole word, but this is still the best adblocker I can find- and it didn't come with any ads!
-------------------------
popup
This is a fantastic app, I love the way it stop all those Pop-ups when I look at a movie or surf the web.
-------------------------
popup
Surfing was becoming so frustrating, with ads playing over what I was trying to watch, constant redirects and pop-up ads blocking text.  So far, it's been great and thoroughly recommend along with Adblock.
-------------------------

Worked instantly! Blocks all ads, pretty much, and even on streaming sites... The annoying questionable ones on the side!

This app is amazing in every sense of the word no more annoying ads on YouTube.
-------------------------
annoy
works extremely well, had the original extension first for a very long time and then added this one to it, exzcellent! although it doesn't block the new form of ads designed to get past adblocks which are hyperlinks on all kinds of random words and phrases--so annoying but i jus pay attention where i hover lol
-------------------------
popup
The program started working instantly.  It is a great program!  I highly recommend this program to anyone that is annoyed with Ads and pop-ups everywhere.

Blocks everything, works fast. Only concern is the loss of revenue from the sites but the new initiative to allow non-intrusive adds seems like the perfect way to regulate overly annoying flashy noisy adds all over every website.
-------------------------
popup
compared to "adblock", this thing blocks virtually nothing. I get popup ads all over newspaper sites, etc.

the similar name is confusing people, to be sure... adblock seems far superior in terms of consistently blocking tons of ads.
-------------------------
annoy
has increased the speed of my internet by so much without all the annoying ads popping up and it makes it so much easier to watch videos without the annoying ads showing up and having to wait
-------------------------
annoy
Great. Installed it a few 
hours ago and has already blocked 130 ads !

It also speeds up my internet because i dont need to load those annoying ads
-------------------------
annoy
Works great on youtube blocking all the annoying video ads they make you watch before you can watch an actual video you want to see!!!
-------------------------

Adblock Plus stopped working for me a few weeks ago. I have been getting pop-ups and regular ads all over the webpages that I visit, and Adblock seems unaware of their existence. It is, however, a good product. I don't know if what happened to me will happen to you guys as well, but I would still recommend it.
-------------------------
annoy
Works wonders!  It blocks all of the annoying ads and discretely hides them away.  Webpages are presented as they should be sans the advertising.  It occurred to me how well this extension works when I used a friends' computer which was not running Adblock Plus.  I couldn't believe how many ads this extension blocks!  However, this extension is not perfect.  The only drawback I have found is that it will incorrectly block the basic functionality of certain websites.  This can be easily fixed by adding the site to your "Whitelist".  I gave it five stars because this is one of the essential extensions you should use! I have used this on Opera and Firefox as well.  Works just as well on any browser.
-------------------------
popup
It was very nice and helped block popup ads and my computer didnt slow down at all.

I love this extension..
No Ads!! No Popups!!

What is Adblock Plus? Only the single greatest source to free yourself from ads! This extension has worked wonders for my computer! By getting rid of all the annoying ads, it has also made a huge contribution in assisting my internet speed and stress levels!! I'd definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone! On a scale of 1-10 this extension is a 32.

Absolutely necessary extension, removes all the annoying ads that have been cluttering the internet. Much nicer browsing time with this extension, and it even makes pages load faster because you aren't always waiting on ads to load just so you can exit out of them or ignore them. Thanks!

It's worked flawlessly for over a year, but recently it's been allowing all sorts of banners, ads, & pop-ups to appear.
-------------------------

Works wonderfully. Sometimes you need to use a computer that doesn't have adblock plus to really appreciate the annoying stuff it blocks for you.
-------------------------
annoy
This is must-have for all people who hate ads. If you're thinking that this will slow your Computer down, it will do the opposite! This has taken off MANY annoying ads. Most of the time, you must like a AdBlock-Type Extension's Facebook, or share to people, this ones completely Free of charge. No fees, No Mal-Ware. And of course, no Hidden-Fees! This is a free to use Extension that will change your whole web surfing experience. My AdBlock had blocked over 24,000 ads! Think of that! Make this the best decision of your life!
-------------------------

Amazing app. Finally no annoying pop up ads!

AMAZING!!! Always blocks every single add on ANY website and you can finally use the internet without any annoying adds! Props to the creator!!!!

THE BEST TO USE IF YOU WANT NO POPUPS!! ;-)

It blocks unwanted ads most of the time and I am loving it specially the youtube ads before the videos which annoys most of the people. We are in youtube to see the videos not the adds.
I am loving it:))))
-------------------------
popup
Does not seem to block pop-up ads for me when I visit certain websites. Other than that, I love it. Even tells you how many ads its blocked in your history of using it. ^-^
-------------------------
popup
Seems to work well for me.

I do not see unwanted ads, popups, etc so it is doing what it is suppose to.
I have been using it for about 1 1/2 years now.

I highly recommend this extension!
-------------------------
popup
While it's great and a major convenience, a lot of pop-ups (New windows, banner ads) are making their way through.  Other than that it works, and best of all, it's FREE. Highly recommend everyone takes the 30 seconds to download it on their browser.
-------------------------
annoy
good for annoyed people annoyed with annoying things
-------------------------
paid
They're paid by google to let ads through (there's a techcrunch article on it). Both this one and the regular AdBlock. We need a proper ad blocker plugin.

Adblock Plus allows you to access websites without annoying adverts. It allows for a cleaner web experience where you can focus on the bare essentials of the information that you want to access.
-------------------------

Gets rid of pesky and annoying advertisements that I HATE so much. I mean I hate it. I hate it more then my own alcoholic father. Man that is TONS of hatred right there. 

10/10 would recommend to anyone who hates advertisements as much as I do.
-------------------------
annoy
worked great for about 6 months then all of a sudden i started seeing adds everywhere. i went and updated it hoping this would remedy annoying youtube adds and nothing
-------------------------
popup
What was once a solid product has become something akin to ordinary, letting popups and popunders through with alarming regularity.
-------------------------

This is one of the best adblocker that I have used.

I will recommend to anyone to use this to keep all of those annoying ads from showing.

It's great

It's Awesome.. blocks all annoying ads when i browse....
-------------------------

Perfect for any browsing.  Keep an eye on it when you're experiencing website problems though, it may be protecting you from popups you're attempting to produce.  Simply allow that site through the block temporarily (or permanently!) and you're golden.  I'd recommend this anyone.
-------------------------

The previous revisions were FANTASTIC. Chrome updated. No longer works at all. Popups, ads, embedded video commercials. All the joys of the internet are back. Woot.
-------------------------
annoy
Dosen't get rid of adverts on facebook, Adfly, youtube, ITV and many other video websites, however it does get rid of annoying banners and stuff. Other adblock extensions have been better for me.

Very useful extension! Has saved me lots of annoyance by not having to wait for ads on YouTube or anime sites.

paid
This is the best plugin ever made if you ask me, if I could give more than 5 stars I would. I can't believe its free, if it had cost $10 I would have paid in a heartbeat after sampling it. Couldn't recommend it more strongly. Keep up the great work, I just pray ad makers don't find a workaround anytime soon.
-------------------------

This is by far the best one on the market. It kills even the annoying video ads. I actually still like written ads. Must have for Chrome.

Dear all, 

My name is Job Plas, and I am the Project Manager for Adblock Plus. Due to a bug, YouTube video ads have been showing for everyone using an adblocker (not only Adblock Plus).

We're happy to announce that we fixed this, and that Adblock Plus is now the only Chrome extension which blocks all annoying YouTube video ads again!

Happy browsing from the ABP team :) 

Best, 
Job

5 star extension now! It works well and I can add my own custom filters/create my own personalized list, if EasyList + Annoyances + Privacy + Fanboy's ULTIMATE & COMPLETE aren't good enough! *scoffs* LOVED IT FOR FIREFOX AND LOVING IT FOR CHROME and better than IE9/ie10's current versions (a bit buggy-ie10), but haven't had any issues, with this extension acting up, or crashing. SO FAR SO GOOD! A SPECIAL THANKS TO THE DEV! YOU ROCK! THANKS! ~S~

I love AdBlock Plus! I had it on Firefox and it was great at keeping 95% of the pop-ups at bay, and 100% keeping stupid sidebar ads on facebook and yahoo away. I was hoping they made an extension for chrome when I made the switch, imagine my delight! :) I fully endorse AdBlock Plus!

*UPDATE* I still love ABP, but on facebook, it only intermittently blocks the sponsored ads :/ Hopefully, they find a permanent fix to this.
-------------------------

-------------------------

I strongly prefer the Adblock Plus approach of blocking annoying ads will allowing ads that are not annoying (e.g. do not consume cpu resources, etc.).

This encourages all the websites that must depend on advertising to prefer well behaved, non-annoying, static ads.

All ad blockers should follow the lead of Adblock Plus in encouraging responsible and considerate advertisements.

I love this program.  Popup ads are one of the most annoying things on the Internet.  They stop you from seeing things, randomly start blasting annoying videos while you are working, and slow down page loading.  As an added bonus, it stops those ads at the beginning of YouTube videos.  It has a few glitches on certain sites, but generally a great program.
-------------------------
annoy
This adblock extension is awesome! It blocks all ads on the sites I go on most! It makes my internet move jet fast and it is great for annoying ads that you'd normally see on sites like Addicting Games and other flash game sites. Parents, I suggest this for your kids and for yourself for your safety.

This is the best ad blocking program (in my opinion) I use it every time I install Chrome now. And it gets rid of annoying adverts in YouTube.

Adblock Plus is excellent i have been looking for something like this for a long time. I am sick and tired of being hit with hundreds of annoying ads every day but now thanks to this zippy chrome add on my life is hassle free

Truly nice extension, though I would have rated it 5 stars if it disabled the popups I occasionally get.. It's not perfect, but it's nearly there, keep up the good work!

Thus far it is by far the best popup ad blocker! Popup ads are junk mail, at least here we can stop them via AdBlock Plus.

While not quite as robust as NoScript in Firefox, AdBlock Plus adds major security (and removes annoyance) from Chrome. Removing adverts not only makes the page cleaner, but can also help prevent "drive-by" attacks from infected web sites. 

Please support the developers of this excellent and necessary tool!

I love this app, it works , it prevents me from seeing all those annoying  advertisements. I have not encountered any problems with it so far. I use Adblock Plus in Chrome and Firefox.

Thanks to the publisher, now I have no problems! No problems with this application :)

This application hugely reduces annoyance associated with the increasingly intrusive nature of online adverts. 
As such, I give it a big'ol thumbs up. And a wink ;)

If this extension can stop the pop-ups, it would be the best Google Chrome extension.
It's so good, no ads at all. The ads in my region are not in the list, but I can block them by myself (:

Excellent! Now I don't have to worry about these annoying ads.

Excellent add-on. The sites I visit are now so much faster and I get to my content much faster. Very effective at blocking most in-page ads and all pop-ups (:
-------------------------
annoy
It's perfect!
It's fast and easy to use, I strongly recommend it to everyone that gets annoyed of adds!
What makes it special is, as I said, that it's fast and easy to use. Unlike most adds blockers that slows the browser down and sometimes makes it crash.

Best Adblocker. Period. No more commercials on YouTube, no pop-ups, no banners. Works just great.

Brilliant. Even blocks those annoying youtube ads before videos.

I love it. Not only does it block ads, it also has a feature that allows it to block unfiltered and annoying webpage elements. Everyone should have it on there Chrome.

Makes surfing (and watching YouTube and Comedy Central and more) so much nicer. I thought I'd been happily ignoring things, but once they were really blocked I realized how annoying they'd still been.

This is the real Adblock Plus for Chrome. Adblock is completely independent and while competent I personally find it never quite meets the complete standards of Adblock Plus. While not quite as powerful as it's Firefox older brother it gets the job done and also does a flawless job of blocking those annoying YouTube streaming ads. If the occasional text ad happens to slip through (never seen it myself. Have a heart and let them display. Sites need to make their revenue somehow and so long as the ads aren't intrusive (banner, video, flash animation etc) then there's nothing to really complain about.

This google app is da best.  I mainly got this because of youtube, but it's so awesome not having to look at annoying ads.

Love It!! makes watching youtube vids less annoying, and it really does work. definitely download!
-------------------------
annoy
Very helpful from the annoying advertisements
-------------------------
annoy
I really like the extension. It makes watching youtube videos that one bit easier without the annoying advertisement. It makes those annoying ads go away when i'm trying to read or download something. :D Thank you it is a great app and i will recommend. I also tried AdBlock but that didnt work as well because when i went on different sites it didn't block the ads.
-------------------------
annoy
I love AdBlock plus! I can watch my favorite youtubers *Cough PewDiePie Cough*  With out the ads!! I can even go on Quizazz and not deal with the annoying ads! I love love LOVE adBlock!
-------------------------

It works great pretty much EVERYWHERE except Livestream and Facebook. It prevents me from seeing a Livestream so I have to turn it off on Livestream and go through video ads. No big deal really.

But Facebook ads are an issue. I notice a lot of them are coming through. That needs to be fixed. Otherwise, awesome extension. Haven't seen an annoying ad anywhere (except Facebook and Livestream) in a long time. It's especially awesome on YouTube.

Efficient indeed. Even in social networking sites this eliminates annoying ads. Great job!

Works perfectly, now I can watch Tobuscus vids without annoying un-skippable ads
-------------------------

Speaking as someone who uses both regularly for nearly the same functions, I agree with a previous reviewer - for some reason, Adblock Plus is WAY more effective at blocking ads in Chrome than Firefox. Even video ads on sites like YouTube, DailyMotion, etc get blocked, in addition to the regular annoying pop-ups/sidebar ads/etc. Highly recommend it!
-------------------------
annoy
Works great!  The only problem I have with this is on hulu.. where instead of a commercial I am forced into 2 minutes of silence... Which is still better than watching the same annoying commercial over and over...
-------------------------
annoy
I've had this extension for quite a while now. The minute it was added, those side ads disappeared! At first I underestimated the abilities. This Extension works great! Advertising is only good for the people who benefit from it, but consumers don't want unnecessary ads that they don't look for. I've been on several websites and people have constantly complained about the various ads. I am perfectly content and happy while browsing. Finally I don't have annoying videos running in the background, where I have to scroll down the never-ending page to pause it! I give this extension an A++!

Absolutely perfect
I have no longer have to put up with popups and adware I have tried adblock on sites I know feature pop up ads and adblock plus defiantly works 100% . I was originally skeptical of this download but now recommend it to all it's well worth your while installing...

Glad to see Adblock Plus  on Chrome. Now im waiting for Adblock Plus Pop-up Addon to be added. When this happens i can finally switch from Firefox to Chrome. Chrome is much better then Firefox, but i use Firefox only for this amazing add-ons.
Adblock Plus and Adblock Plus Pop-up are the best add-ons out there.

Works great, I installed the same day I got Chrome... I now I don't even remember that those annoying ads exist... You should have this!

At last no more annoying ad's!!! Blissimo!! :)

THIS is exactly what I've been looking for!! So far it works GREAT, and I'm loving the faster load times, and of course, no more annoying ads! I've encountered no bugs either, however like other reviewers mentioned, I do have to disable ABP when logging into certain google features, but since I rarely use those anyway, it's not a problem for me. Thanks for creating such a useful extension, I'm definitely recommending this one!
-------------------------
annoy
Great extension, definitely worth a download. It could certainly use some streamlining though, several webpages have very long load times, it's not crippling but it is annoying.
-------------------------
annoy
Great! The best way to get rid off annoying ads and trackers.

One bug I found: The lists aren't updated automatically.

Works great, no problems here, unlike the other AdBlock that broke Chrome on my PC. Wouldn't touch the other if you paid me.

Adblock Plus! Nice! I hope that it will block the annoying video commersials before many youtube videos. :)

This is one of my favourite extensions in the Google Chrome store.

It works like a charm, especially after adding extra subscriptions.  

Website s are now a pleasure to read and I can actually follow the flow of the content. I especially like the complete absence of popups and other Flash nonsense.

The only feature I miss from the Firefox version is the "disable for this site" option on the button that automatically adds the current site to the whitelist.

All-in-all, I love the extension and keep up the good work!
-------------------------

its almost identical to adblock plus

the thing you cant Subscribe Fanboy's Annoyance  is VERY BAD !!
all other fanboy list is working fine

Let me cut to the chase: this is an excellent crap-zapper. Makes the whole interstatenet experience so much less annoying. You won't see them dang ads and banners no more and I am gruntled. That's good.

EASILY the best ad-blocker I've ever found. Wanna block a specific element you don't like on a page? The feature to do so is readily available, just a few clicks, then bam, you have access to block anything possible. Wanna stop ad-blocking because you want to give a few cents to a kind stranger? Done, with nothing but a click within the menu. I definitely recommend getting it, because it not only works incredibly well, but others have mentioned how they've been using it for years without a problem in other reviews, and I've found proof of that firsthand. Not a single ad, no weirdness, nothing; it's genuinely near flawless. Easiest 10/10 of my LIFE.

Edit: yeah, I was right, I just didn't know how right I was. For any who somehow stumble across this review, if you have something like those premium subscription pop-ups that sometimes slip through, you can block those as well using the built-in feature. Just click the block option in the menu that pops up when you click on the extension next to the search bar at the top, and hover over what you want to block, then move the mouse around the general area until it highlights the full part of what you want to block, including its background. If you're having trouble going back to the normal page and you have been blocked from interacting with it, then you can open a new tab (or duplicate it), reload your current one, or press the back button. There's also an option to un-block something in the settings if you wish to do so, although you can just fully disable ad blocking for the specific page you're on within that same menu that you used earlier.

This adblokcer is based on Manifest Version 2 that will soon be phased out by google and MV3 will take its place and then this will stop working
It's betterto use a newer and modern adblocker that will work better

This is freaking amaizing it helps you protect yourself and stops all those 2 ads before a youtube video. while i have seen some ads on sites that show evan with this on it is amaizing and usualy things this good would need you to pay for them.

Is the best adblocker I've used, it works perfectly and when certain sites demand you to turn it off you don't need to keep activating it again, and every time you access the website again it's still deactivated (sorry for bad English, It's my 2nd language and I'm still trying to learn how to write properly )

I really love this adblocker, I changed a bunch of adblockers. AdBlock Plus is the best free adblocker I have used. I would totally recommend it. When on YouTube, sometimes the website doesn't load. If you reload the tab, it will start working again.

Good adblocker. Except it also blocks the honey chrome extension. If it can be fixed it's 5 star

This app works great. I like the way you can turn off blocking for just one page. Sites to block are continually  updated within the app. The allow site feature get automatically populated when you turn off blocking to a particular site or page and the list is easy find in settings if you need to change or remove a site. Advanced features include the ability to create your own or import custom access or blocking filters/lists. You can even force an update to or edit the built in filters/lists
-------------------------
mess
Completely amazing. Not a single add since I have installed it. Especially as I go on YouTube often, I haven't had to deal with 3 adds in a row. Does not mess up my laptop at all and I would highly recommend. Its blocked over 13 thousand adds which is incredible.

it's so nice that there's no pressure.

Great free ad blocker when used properly. Once in awhile there are minor issues like it turning off (probably caused by an update - it's own or another that interfered with it somehow) or ads showing again on some websites but nothing a remove and reinstall won't fix.

I have a couple of macbook pros.
i learned not to do updates for safari, because it removed my adblock plus and i could never use it again... i have mojave on one, am not going to update it, and adblock plus is like God to me, living for two years with ads on youtube, now ad free completely...
i find every couple of weeks youtube or google comes out with a new bypass probably a trojan on a video i watch, but i found a way to stop all ads...
all you do is open the adblock plus icon on top of your screen, on CHROME, which I am using, NOT safari, it wont work on safari anymore... but on Chrome, when you install adblock plus, you get a red icon on top of screen. Click on the gear and open settings then on left go to Advanced, and then update your filter lists and you will stop all youtube ads...

I was just about to quit YouTube due to all the ads. Someone online, who saw my complaint, suggested Adblock. I'm so grateful that he did. It's renewed my appreciation of videos. It works great. No ads interrupting the videos. Although it's free, they do take donations and every now and then I send a few bucks, it's worth it to me. They don't bug you after you've made a donation. I was worried about that. Anyway, it's a great extension.

Best app ever!  Ad free forever....over a decade ad free.  I started using ABP many years ago it's been so long I forget now.  Every time I'm over my parents or a friends house I look at their screens and I cannot believe all the junky flashy pop up ad's that get in their way.  They have lost complete control of how their electronic devices work.  The ad companies have taken over.  Every time I buy a new laptop or pc I download ABP immediately.  Just being without it for those few moments upon startig up a new machine I'm bombarded the second I go to any web site.  Nope not for me.  ABP has stopped all that non sense.  I'm in control of my computers.  No ad's.  No pop up's.    Very easy to use.  Seamless.  Just set it and forget it.  Download and you are all set.  Thank you ABP for all the wonderful years of your wonderful software.  I'm poor and disabled and cant donate a dime but if I was a rich girl you would get a nice donation.  I hope my review makes up for my lack of funds.

This app is awesome, and makes my experience very well. I had this for almost one year from now. It helped me avoid all those annoying ads on YouTube, and it saves time. The bad thing about it is when it suddenly stops working, and I have to re-install it to make it work again. It doesn't block every single ad, but it blocks most ads and all the ads that need to be blocked. This extension is one of the extensions I would recommend to people, but it would be nice to support people by disabling it.

I was pretty skeptical since I've never used an ad blocker before and I wasn't exactly sure how it would even work. My intention was simply to get rid of the annoying pop-ups that would appear over youtube videos, but I had no idea that it would actually stop commercials from playing when watching any online video, as well! This is incredible! All I had to do was download and the ad-blocker just worked on it's own. I didn't even have to worry about downloading malware with it, like most online downloads. This is amazing!

Adblock Plus has been a lifesaver for me.  We live in a rural community and our only internet is our cell phone hotspot.  I don't get enough speed or bandwidth to manage lots of ads or streaming, and we nearly gave up on internet altogether because of that.  Adblock Plus has changed all this and allows us to have internet access without all the additional web noise.  THANK YOU!

Stops annoying ads. Lets a few through that are useful.
-------------------------
mess
Been using this extension for YEARS.  (knock on wood..) Never have had issue with it in Google Chrome.  Very VERY satisfied with the end result (no fuss, no mess, no FEE).  Try it.  Go ahead... ;)
-------------------------
stop
Great adblocker. wish it would stop the ads that open in new tabs though. Some websites use that workaround
-------------------------
access
Ad block plus is recommended for my PC let's you keep the ads away such as accessing you tube videos and even other pop ups.
-------------------------
load
All you have to do is set it and forget it. You can read articles uninterrupted, your content loads much faster, it protects you from false links/scamming/spamming/phishing/ID theft, this FREE app does so much.
-------------------------
reload
This is by far the best ad blocker out there. Its simpler and easier to use than the other ones. While it doesn't block EVERY SINGLE AD on some pages it still offers a feature where you can manually block the element (blocking it from the code itself) so that any code like that in the elements tab wont show up on the page when you reload it. I would give 4 stars if it didn't have that feature. Overall though, Ad Blocker Plus works VERY WELL and makes load times faster than Firefox.
-------------------------

absolutely amazing when it was working. It just stopped working for me today
-------------------------
stop
Same for me, at first it works but stopped working as well. I found one that works everytime.https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblocker-for-yt/ldbflapfegfcoipoeophhjbgfcllmjip

access
That's not true. It has this in settings, and I am pasting it here to show you.  If you set ON SPECIFIC sites. it allows you to enter them.

Site access

Allow this extension to read and change all your data on websites you visit:
On click
On specific sites
On all sites
-------------------------
load
Reliable and fuss-free. Love the ability to toggle the extension for certain websites and target specific ads with a right-click. I use it almost all the time to block out potential security threats or just to speed up loading. I definitely recommend this over any other ad blocking extensions.
-------------------------
fix
Fix this, fast. Can't live with ads. Has been a great product.

Hi!

We  are releasing a fix for this soon. In the meantime, try installing Adblock plus on the Dev version of Chrome. You can download that version here https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/. Install Adblock Plus here https://adblockplus.org. Feel free to contact us if you have any more questions!

Thanks

that new design is laggy. what happened to the old one guys seriously not cool. please fix this and i will give it 5 stars
-------------------------
fix
I was able to fix it by clicking background page and doing a full application cache clear... which also logged me out of everything, but it was worth it.
-------------------------
stop
He's correct, PornHub pays adblocker to stop, in fact many popular sites do this. Business as usual, better find another adblocker that isn't known ffs
-------------------------
fix
I have been having the same issue sadly. I've used this for so many years and worked great in that time. Please fix Ad block plus!
-------------------------
fix
haha fix your product

I've been using this adblocker for a long time and it never fails to impress. Great extension, great developers. Fast and amazing. Thanks for all you guys do!
-------------------------
load
Been using for more than 3 years now, has always worked the same.

Really speeds up a page's load time and gets rid of those annoying banners, web links and pop up videos.
-------------------------
fix
go to advanced settings and update filter lists, i read this down below and it fixed it for me hope this helps
-------------------------
stop
This extension is seriously functional.It has stopped the annoying ad's on web pages 98% of times.I am extremely grateful to the developers for designing the right solution to get rid of unwanted ad's
-------------------------
stop
I will definitely NOT live without this extension.  This extension is God sent.  So easy to use and it stops those annoying ads just like it's suppose to.  It even stops ads before you play on online video games.  I love this extension.  It does what I want it to do.  If a website gets picky about you using it, just click on the ABP icon and tick disable for this site.  Then un-tick when your done.  Thank you so much for this.  One very grateful user :D  And note:  I noticed some people said it stopped working, not for me and I used it for around 3 years now.
-------------------------
stop
Literally same! It has just stopped working for me today after I've been using it for years
-------------------------

I really love Adblock Plus!

It automatically blocks almost every advertisement, even the annoying popup ones on YT videos. It also makes pages load a lot faster on my outdated computer which is a huge plus.

One feature that I really like is being able to whitelist individual websites so AB+ won't block their ads. That gives me the ability to support websites that I like by allowing them to earn a little ad revenue from me. It also makes me feel like I have a lot more control over my privacy.
-------------------------
load
Been using Adblock Plus for years in all my devices and it never failed my expectations. I just want ABP to add a period of how long ABP be disabled on certain site because sometimes we need to disable ABP to correctly load a site but forgot to enable it again. Aside from it, ABP does a great job. Thanks!
-------------------------
break
Its always worked perfectly fine for me. And its nice to see Shannon Bell from the ABP support team is quick on the draw to shut down those 1 star crybabies. "Sold out rip adblock" gimme a break man. Its a free program so zip it or go elsewhere. Thank you Adblock for all the years of torture free web browsing.
-------------------------
stop
After a few weeks, adblock plus stopped working. We do hope for the better service. Great app. Please keep going!
-------------------------
access
It does it's job and does it well. I do have some issues with sites which will block access if this is on, but that isn't an issue that can be fixed by this extension. And while it does miss a few ads every once in a while, it has been reliable and makes browsing the Internet much better.
-------------------------
stop
You mean AdBlock Plus has betrayed us? I also see ads popping up, so AdBlock PLUS, STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-------------------------
load
ebay has been very slow for me lately, i was watching all these ad-server url's in the progress box, so i installed this app, Adblock Plus, left on default settings and now it blocks 18 elements on every ebay page refresh and it's MUCH faster loading the content ... THIS IS A GREAT APP !
-------------------------
stop
THIS IS THE CORRECT VERSION, THERE WAS A VERSION GOING AROUND NOT TOO LONG AGO, IT HAD THE SAME NAME AND LOOK!... BYT THIS IS DEFINTLY THE 1 FOR ME, AS IT STOPS ALL POP UPS!, WHICH IS GREAT.. BUT 1 OR 2 A DAY WOULD BE NICE!, (IF ITS AN OFFER?)...LOL, 10/10 FOR THIS 1.. SERIOUSLY GUYS, THERE ARE LOTS OUT THERE, BUT THEY SIMPLY DONT DO WHAT THIS APP DOES! & THATS TO BLOCK THE ADS!!!.
-------------------------
stop
Love it! The other adblock stopped working and went down.  This is a much better alternative!
-------------------------
stop
I really liked this Adblock Plus extension. It works for almost all websites but now it is loosing the touch with some website adds(it seems like adds are getting smarter) I am going to try another add blocker for some times and will use this again for sure cause this worked for me for over an year. No hard feelings :D

NOTE: Back to this plugin again cause this plugin is the best app for youtube ads. Most other plugins remove youtube ads but the videos stop and start again where the ads suppose to play but this plugin play videos from start to end without any distractions. Cool..
-------------------------
stop
Try getting avast, this helps stop general popups I found.
-------------------------
error
I  seem to have disabled Adblock plus in error earlier.  The difference is notible.  I had forgotten how unpleasant and strange it is when adverts pop up.  This is an excellent app
-------------------------
load
100% blockage of ads and no effects on speeds of loading or anything else. Flawless app.
-------------------------
crash
nice but sometime crash
-------------------------

I have been using adblock Puse version since I had read online that it blocked the unwanted ads and loads webpage faster and prevents malware and viruses from entering through various links which is great and best of all it is easy to use.

Probably because youtube charges to have ads removed now, so not all the fault of the app, but that's pretty much all i used it for. If the youtube access can be fixed it'll deserve the 5 stars again. For now Using AB regular works great.

Highly recommended! All computers that I work on, this is one of the first things I make sure to put on them. Everyone likes not seeing the ads on their computers anymore. Ads are the cause of most bloatware installed on computers I fix up. If you don't have this installed; You Should.

Fantastic adblocker. Have not had one problem with overusing RAM or CPU or anything. Once found an unblocked ad, but reported it and they fixed it immediately. Fantastic adblocker, and especially good because it's open-source.

Really speeds up web page loading on slower internet connections. Easily disabled on various sites when required. 

One of my favorite extensions and usually the first installed when setting up a new browser.

I've used adblock for years and never had issues until now. The game site I'm hooked on now treats adblock like an enemy, & if we have it, we're forced to see only a black screen where the games USED to load-the games never load. My choice is to keep adblock and go find another game site! Let me also add that adblock plus works on EVERYTHING else perfectly!!

Yes, it does what it says but the in performance cost is high.

With nothing else running on a Chromebook, this takes nearly 400MB of RAM.  On the 2 GB CB I first tested, that limited the size of documents I could handle in Docs, and nearly doubled the loading and scrolling times of a 100 page document.

This is a great plugin. I am guessing all the 1-star reviews are from morons, or people hired by a competing product.  I love Adblock Plus.  Over 10 million users does not scream 1-star product to me.  I accidentally installed AdBlock on one of my computers instead of Adblock Plus and was shocked at how many ads it failed to block.  Installed Adblock Plus instead and POOF, back to normal.  I have given multiple donations to the developer.  I appreciate that you have the option of getting down into the base level of being able to write your own filters if you need to.

I've had ad block plus for so long, and I've loved it, it works great. But now that they're being paid to show specific ads, I'm jumping ship to ublock origins.

Easy to use.  It is great for blocking ads, especially ads that appear to be tech support and error messages.  Also helps large pages with huge numbers of ads load faster.  (I do sympathize with companies who provide news or tools for free, and I do disable Ad Blocker on those websites, for example newspaper websites, provided the ads are not excessive or confusing.  That is easy to do, just click on the ABP stopsign and deselect "Enabled on this site".)  To sum up, I've used ABP for years and I highly recommend it.

Wow dude, your understand of the internet and how it works is atrocious.  
First of all, the internet is NOT free...we pay ISP's out the butt to access the internet and THAT should be considered our "membership" fee (if you will) when it comes to P2P...but, that's a whole 'nother ball of wax.
Secondly, the "internet" doesn't rely on ad's...the websites rely on ads.  And, truth be told, they don't rely on ads, they just take advantage of the opportunity to sell ad's if they're a popular site.  The more popular the site, the more ad's they sell.

Well since the original Adblock decided to stop blocking ads for me, I had to find a new and improved software that would continue to do so and this was the answer! So far no complaints as it has worked 100% well for me!

Thanks for your service!

This app is amazing! Most reviews for other products are usually filled with fake reviews so I wasn't holding out much hope this app would be any better than the rest. But, I was willing to give it a try and was very pleased to see this one was actually the real deal. It is extremely rare now that anything gets past it. I visited a sight not long ago that attempted to use the rapid fire method of breaking through ABP but totally failed. I even watched the counter to see if it would make it and it finally gave up at 235 attempts in about 55 seconds. Give it a try and you'll see what I mean.

Works great! Easy to turn off and on where adblocking limits access to content. Very robust in removing ads PLUS it allows one to kill items on pages that are irritating. It's also available from their website for android devices that are NOT rooted and it works great on those (have it on both my phone and tablet). Note that Google removed ABP for Android from the Play store because they cater to advertisers on Android -- bad act, Google.

Used this Extension for over 2 years and NEVER had an issue aside from me rolling back my PC yesterday and came to find for some reason i had to reinstall ABP along with Chrome itself due to an error; when i went to open chrome ABP was still installed but the statistics didnt show anything in the little icon window and it wasn't blocking any ads even when enabled on the current page.

If Miika Ahonen had viewed the .png in question, he'd see it's the adblock 'ads blocked' counter. If he stopped browsing the sites that were trying to rapidly pop-up ads, he wouldn't have that problem. You obviously did some work to find what your PC was doing, don't cry wolf on adblock.

Very nice. Clean design, simple to use, don't get rid of it because it is a good program. If I didn't need some of the ads just for information purposes when I'm online doing research, I would block every single ad and feel comfortable that this program has the ability to do it and I don't have to keep messing with it to tweak it to block this and that. A very useful program to cut down on spyware and other tracking junk that our computers don't need.

is a great app but the problem is that they need to have an update on it cause i've noticed in the past month that alot of ads have gotten through and now even when i search on Google i get ads. so i hope that they have an update on it soon and that it gets fixed. other than that everything about ad blocker plus is great

Adblock Plus stopped working for me a few weeks ago. I have been getting pop-ups and regular ads all over the webpages that I visit, and Adblock seems unaware of their existence. It is, however, a good product. I don't know if what happened to me will happen to you guys as well, but I would still recommend it.
-------------------------
fix
Works wonders!  It blocks all of the annoying ads and discretely hides them away.  Webpages are presented as they should be sans the advertising.  It occurred to me how well this extension works when I used a friends' computer which was not running Adblock Plus.  I couldn't believe how many ads this extension blocks!  However, this extension is not perfect.  The only drawback I have found is that it will incorrectly block the basic functionality of certain websites.  This can be easily fixed by adding the site to your "Whitelist".  I gave it five stars because this is one of the essential extensions you should use! I have used this on Opera and Firefox as well.  Works just as well on any browser.

No longer blocks anything..Was the best thing ever. Someone fix this please.

WOW I can't believe how many ads have been blocked by this extension. Every time I go to a website, I keep seeing the amount of ads that have been blocked and I'm still shocked. I can cruise through the web without waiting anymore. Although I can't seem to stop ads on Hulu, I don't mind. But I feel like 99 percent of the time this thing works great! Even blocks the ads on facebook! WOW. I'm donating money to them right now. Thank you for the amazing service/ extension you've created. I really appreciate it!

bug
This extension is really the best AdBlocker.
I've heard loads of complaints about their AdBlocker blocking their videos, bugging out an not blocking anything.. Not for AdBlock Plus! It has always worked 100% since the beggining!
-------------------------
hang
Works well, but it seems slow and Chrome keeps hanging up on "Waiting for extension Adblock Plus."  Would also be nice to see a list of what ads were blocked instead of just a count.

Adblock Plus allows you to access websites without annoying adverts. It allows for a cleaner web experience where you can focus on the bare essentials of the information that you want to access.

Good extension. Saved me from irritating pop ups and Ad's. Try it :). But it stops working after few days and all ads pop up in video streaming

It worked amazingly before but now its stopped working. I really hope this gets fixed so we can continue loving this extension.
-------------------------

Works like a charm most of the time, some ads don't seem to be blocked, but for the most part it's reliable. It stops Video ads so if you spend long hours browsing Youtube like me you'll love this.

Stopped blocking ads for me within the last few days, but i went into the options (from extensions page) and realized i needed to add a filter 'subscription' (Easylist) again. not sure why it went away, but for anybody confused about seeing ads, try this!

As good as it works most of the time, it has its periods where it stops working all together. I love it when it works for a good several months but  for the time of when it stops working, its a real drag

bug
This is working fine, and I had the same problem as everyone else here. Perhaps the author of the program should note this: The filters were somehow disabled, whether by a crafty website or via update bug. Just go into the ABP settings and select to add filers. Choose the language filter that suits you and WALLA! it works perfectly again. I hope this helps.

I have never had any problem with this addon whatsoever.  It's always worked exactly as promised, across a variety of different web browsers, and made my web browsing experience a whole lot more pleasant.  On lower-end machines, it does slow things down ever-so-slightly while loading, but aside from that, this is an absolute must have for both casual web surfers and people looking through specific sites.
-------------------------

Very good But it makes page loading & browser speed low.

This extension is fantastic, but when it has to be turned off for particular video players to load. The nice part is that it will only show one ad and it will then continue ad-free after that. 

I highly recommend this extension to anyone!
-------------------------

Blocks ads for youtube and when watching tv shows on various websites. It is very nice. It does not stop your browsing data from being recorded. If you ask it too block them, it does some. Ghostely does the rest for me. Between the two, you have a lot of control over what advertisement companies can do to and "for you."

Adblock Plus was working like a charm up until a week ago, then all these ads started appearing again. Please fix you guys!

bug
Dear all, 

My name is Job Plas, and I am the Project Manager for Adblock Plus. Due to a bug, YouTube video ads have been showing for everyone using an adblocker (not only Adblock Plus).

We're happy to announce that we fixed this, and that Adblock Plus is now the only Chrome extension which blocks all annoying YouTube video ads again!

Happy browsing from the ABP team :) 

Best, 
Job

Excellent add-on, makes the web useable again, and I like the it has an option to allow non-intrusive ads, I don't mind google ads for example, I just don't want large flashing "You've won" ads everywhere I go. For people saying it has stopped working, update your listings, and find some extra ones!

5 star extension now! It works well and I can add my own custom filters/create my own personalized list, if EasyList + Annoyances + Privacy + Fanboy's ULTIMATE & COMPLETE aren't good enough! *scoffs* LOVED IT FOR FIREFOX AND LOVING IT FOR CHROME and better than IE9/ie10's current versions (a bit buggy-ie10), but haven't had any issues, with this extension acting up, or crashing. SO FAR SO GOOD! A SPECIAL THANKS TO THE DEV! YOU ROCK! THANKS! ~S~

works fine! popups keep coming up though. please fix.

It stops working overtime or if Google chrome crashes or if the extension it self crashes it stops working but it works great this is my 3rd time reinstalling it.

I love AdBlock Plus! I had it on Firefox and it was great at keeping 95% of the pop-ups at bay, and 100% keeping stupid sidebar ads on facebook and yahoo away. I was hoping they made an extension for chrome when I made the switch, imagine my delight! :) I fully endorse AdBlock Plus!

*UPDATE* I still love ABP, but on facebook, it only intermittently blocks the sponsored ads :/ Hopefully, they find a permanent fix to this.

Hands down one of the best extensions available. Blocks YouTube ads, search ads, dashboard ads, Pandora ads (on and off), ads of literally every single type. The one improvement that could be made is some way to show if a full-page ad has been blocked; it is sometimes unclear whether a large ad is blocked or the page simply fails to load.
-------------------------
stop
Great extension.  The best I have tried.  Stops the adds in Yahoo mail.
-------------------------

I have been using this plug in long enough to say that it takes out annoying ads and I want to suggest that for improvement make sure that it doesn't crash so much.

Used the "Adblock" plugin for Chrome before switching to "Adblock Plus". So far it's been faster than Adblock and it doesn't break some sites that Adblock did. Overall, great plugin.

But only 4 stars becouse at youtube i cannot search results. If you fix that i'll change it to 5 'till then 4 only. But thanks really best extension of its kind!!

If you download this for the sole purpose it removes Pandora ads, it's worth your time.  I was on ESPN's website looking at Xgames crashes and forced to watch the same stupid 30sec clip before every video when I started looking for a way to stop it.  This works and is probably my favorite Chrome ad on.

Does anyone else notice the initial loading of it when opening a new chrome browser, it takes forever for adblock to load.

chrome browser status bar just hangs for a couple minutes saying loading adblock...

works perfect after it loads though

Good except for it breaks a few sites.

Great Addon, but please bring back the pause adblock feature, it makes  it very frustrating to have to disable and enable by going to the extension manager, rather than pause and unpause.

FIX IT. Thanks

I love this program.  Popup ads are one of the most annoying things on the Internet.  They stop you from seeing things, randomly start blasting annoying videos while you are working, and slow down page loading.  As an added bonus, it stops those ads at the beginning of YouTube videos.  It has a few glitches on certain sites, but generally a great program.

Adblock Plus is a fantastic tool and add-on for Firefox, it allows you to block internet ads, block un-wanted images, which generally speeds up loading time on websites. 
It's easy to configure and has a set list of known ad suppliers to block so you don't have to input anything.
-------------------------

I don't like the fact that it doesn't work as well a it does in FF. The ads actually load, and I can see them for a second, and then they disappear. The FF version prevents them from loading completely. Still nice though. 4/5

Thus far it is by far the best popup ad blocker! Popup ads are junk mail, at least here we can stop them via AdBlock Plus.

-------------------------

Much better than the other 'AdBlock' extension. This one has been around for a very long time, and gets 99% of ads, and who cares about the rare ones that might pop up. The 'AdBlock' version uses a very sluggish method, and cannot display pages  correctly until after it is fully modified. It also increases cpu usage significantly and will drink up netbook batterys like gaterade. This is the best choice for almost every situation. Webpages load FASTER due to less work being done, not slower due to the method the other one uses.
-------------------------
crash
It's perfect!
It's fast and easy to use, I strongly recommend it to everyone that gets annoyed of adds!
What makes it special is, as I said, that it's fast and easy to use. Unlike most adds blockers that slows the browser down and sometimes makes it crash.
-------------------------

I love this extension ... the only thing I think that needs corrected is the fact that when you start Chrome and the previous session loads the extension doesn't block the adware before loading the pages.

I've been using this for a very long time and I've loved it... But suddenly I've started having adds again. That needs to be fixed. I loved it though.

Best adblock in Town !! Removes every add visible and loads pages faster. If adds do pop up then just click the "Adblock Plus icon" in the omnibox and then click the "AD" on that page, the ad would no longer appear and it's url entry will be made in the filter list (For future reference).......  
Haven't been pestered by  many adds since I've started using this addon (Past 1 year, on firefox and chrome). Thanks and keep up the good work :)

It works great pretty much EVERYWHERE except Livestream and Facebook. It prevents me from seeing a Livestream so I have to turn it off on Livestream and go through video ads. No big deal really.

But Facebook ads are an issue. I notice a lot of them are coming through. That needs to be fixed. Otherwise, awesome extension. Haven't seen an annoying ad anywhere (except Facebook and Livestream) in a long time. It's especially awesome on YouTube.

Does not get every single ad on the internet and it lately is letting all ads through. This extension is nice and VERY fast when it's compared to other adblock extensions.

My God people stop complaining so much.  This is a great extension. No way its going to block 100% of the ads, the ad agencies will always find ways to bypass this.  Be greatful that it works well.  This extension is awesome, makes browsing the web so much better.

I used Ad Block Plus with Firefox and I loved it.  This one works well but doesn't block all of the advertisements in video sites like South Park Studios and Hulu, for example.

Easy to use, very user friendly. The only complaint to be had from me is the software sometimes times out before it can make a connection, causing the VPN to be shut down while running internet operations as you normally would. If you are not paying attention to the connection status every once in a while, you could be off VPN and not know it. But overall excellent VPN, I will continue to refer people to this product!

@Rilriia Kilurden I wish we all knew how everything works before we could review them. For example, to tell my friend how much I like my new apartment, that it doesn't have a damp problem or it is airy, I perhaps should know what is a Tartan Grid, how the Fenestration structurally interacts with the Miesian parti despite being an afterthought. Given your tone of (relatively) great expertise on matters of advertisements on the Internet, you must have surely understood what this 'amateur' is talking about and also the amount of truth in the words. Yes, it does block ads which cover most of the page i.e. be intrusive. Yes, there are intrusive ads which, on clicking 'x' or 'close', redirect to the respective link being advertised and literally trick us. To end my statement, the review is accurate, helpful and not intellectually grating; your reply is not.

EASILY the best ad-blocker I've ever found. Wanna block a specific element you don't like on a page? The feature to do so is readily available, just a few clicks, then bam, you have access to block anything possible. Wanna stop ad-blocking because you want to give a few cents to a kind stranger? Done, with nothing but a click within the menu. I definitely recommend getting it, because it not only works incredibly well, but others have mentioned how they've been using it for years without a problem in other reviews, and I've found proof of that firsthand. Not a single ad, no weirdness, nothing; it's genuinely near flawless. Easiest 10/10 of my LIFE.

Edit: yeah, I was right, I just didn't know how right I was. For any who somehow stumble across this review, if you have something like those premium subscription pop-ups that sometimes slip through, you can block those as well using the built-in feature. Just click the block option in the menu that pops up when you click on the extension next to the search bar at the top, and hover over what you want to block, then move the mouse around the general area until it highlights the full part of what you want to block, including its background. If you're having trouble going back to the normal page and you have been blocked from interacting with it, then you can open a new tab (or duplicate it), reload your current one, or press the back button. There's also an option to un-block something in the settings if you wish to do so, although you can just fully disable ad blocking for the specific page you're on within that same menu that you used earlier.

Blocks all ads. If anything slips through, you can just click block element. Its free, its reliable, its Adblock Plus. Ive been using it for a long time, and it is probably the best extension I have. Its crucial for any pc.

Awesome extension. It can block almost all ads except a few items but user can hide those exceptional ads manually. So I think it's okay. 
It's the best ad blocker as I used before.

Easy to use, very user friendly. The only complaint to be had from me is the software sometimes times out before it can make a connection, causing the VPN to be shut down while running internet operations as you normally would. If you are not paying attention to the connection status every once in a while, you could be off VPN and not know it. But overall excellent VPN, I will continue to refer people to this product!

Would be better if there's a way to turn off ads for specific YouTube channels.

ABP got the blocks on lockdown. Extremely useful for Youtube specifically, no ads at all when viewing. That's really the extent of my use, but most other sights I'm not seeing ads on.
Also love that you can turn it on and off pretty fast. Needed to once and it wasn't confusing.

Works as intended. When turned on i don't get adds, if i turn it off, i get adds. IT WORKS WELL

Is the best adblocker I've used, it works perfectly and when certain sites demand you to turn it off you don't need to keep activating it again, and every time you access the website again it's still deactivated (sorry for bad English, It's my 2nd language and I'm still trying to learn how to write properly )

This app works great. I like the way you can turn off blocking for just one page. Sites to block are continually  updated within the app. The allow site feature get automatically populated when you turn off blocking to a particular site or page and the list is easy find in settings if you need to change or remove a site. Advanced features include the ability to create your own or import custom access or blocking filters/lists. You can even force an update to or edit the built in filters/lists
-------------------------

Idea: Maybe add a feature where when websites detect an adblocker and tell you to turn it off. Maybe add a feature where those websites cant detect it? Just a suggestion, if you like it contact me at, Ultimateflexer123456@gmail.com THANKS love it btw

Good adblocker, reliable, but i notice that if i turn off my pc/laptop/chromebook and my chrome has auto recover or restore the tabs thing, and the tab i was on is a youtube vid, ads appear unless i open a new youtube tab. overall good adblocker!

Great free ad blocker when used properly. Once in awhile there are minor issues like it turning off (probably caused by an update - it's own or another that interfered with it somehow) or ads showing again on some websites but nothing a remove and reinstall won't fix.

Awesome extension that cut down on a lot of unnecessary ads... can also choose to have ads or no ads at all by turning off the ad blocker and refreshing the page. Saved me from lots of ugly ads blocking the page. Highly highly recommend!

Agreeing with the most Recent comments (please filter reviews and read them in that order, because older reviews are not correct any more.) This ABP is now more efficient, has added features, and works very well!

I love that it has the block-element feature too, for any kind of specific page element or image you don't want to see :)

There's nothing I currently feel is missing. All I know is when I turn it off, I see how much I'm NOT missing! :)

May I ask the dev's a question? Does this actually block/skip ads in Spotify Free? Because a friend of mine gets no ads there now. Even if it doesn't, that's not a problem, just curious!

Thank you for this great extension!

I have a couple of macbook pros.
i learned not to do updates for safari, because it removed my adblock plus and i could never use it again... i have mojave on one, am not going to update it, and adblock plus is like God to me, living for two years with ads on youtube, now ad free completely...
i find every couple of weeks youtube or google comes out with a new bypass probably a trojan on a video i watch, but i found a way to stop all ads...
all you do is open the adblock plus icon on top of your screen, on CHROME, which I am using, NOT safari, it wont work on safari anymore... but on Chrome, when you install adblock plus, you get a red icon on top of screen. Click on the gear and open settings then on left go to Advanced, and then update your filter lists and you will stop all youtube ads...
ADBLOCK PLUS, i love you, saving me data way out in the bush using my phone... thank you guys you are tops...

Been surfing the web for awhile and had bad experiences with other adblockers, until I finally got this one. blocks everything and if there's a script that bypasses it they have a feature where you can block the element manually and you won't ever see it.

I have been using this service for years now, close to five years I believe. I am more than satisfied with it, and have been since I began using it years ago. If you are looking for a quality ad blocking service, I would highly recommend using this one!
This has gone above and beyond my expectations. I originally starting using it to just block ads when doing schoolwork, but now I rarely turn it off.
-------------------------
off
This works. Like definitely works. I've been using it for a while, and I've only seen one ad. In any case where you see one just report it, it's not that hard. Also make sure you have 'Acceptable Ads' off. And of course, an ad will find a way through, which is why all ad blockers have to update. I don't know why people are having speed problems because Chrome's speed has been completely fine for me. It's a great ad blocker, and i'd recommend it. (✿◡‿◡)

I've been using this extension for around 3 or 4 years now, and it has worked amazingly! Of course, there are some times when the extension needs to be turned off because the acceptable ads policy isn't on a specific website, but that rarely ever happens. All in all, a must-have for anyone using Chrome.

Works better than I ever thought that it would.  I've used Adblock Plus for years now on several different computers/laptops, and its performance has amazed me. it has out performed other ad blockers by far.  I have no complaints at all.  To top it off, it's FREE!

I really like this. Easy adblocker to use, easy to add custom filters, easy to turn on and off.

Excellent. Works very well. Uses rather a lot of memory, but every time I have to turn it off (because a website forces me to) I hear the CPU fan spin up because of all the extra flashing ads it's loading. Would love if you guys can make it harder for websites to force us to take it off.

Works extremely well! I haven't seen ads in a very long time! Until now sadly. Twitter's new format doesn't let this extension block ads, that's the only problem I've had so far though! Would highly recommend.
I'd just like to request that someone make is so promoted tweets can be blocked again with this so I don't have to manually block them : ))!!

This is by far the best ad blocker out there. Its simpler and easier to use than the other ones. While it doesn't block EVERY SINGLE AD on some pages it still offers a feature where you can manually block the element (blocking it from the code itself) so that any code like that in the elements tab wont show up on the page when you reload it. I would give 4 stars if it didn't have that feature. Overall though, Ad Blocker Plus works VERY WELL and makes load times faster than Firefox.

It even stops ads before you play on online video games.  I love this extension.  It does what I want it to do.  If a website gets picky about you using it, just click on the ABP icon and tick disable for this site.  Then un-tick when your done.  Thank you so much for this.

I love the concept of Acceptable Ads. 

For those that aren't aware, this extension doesn't block ALL ads right out of the box. They have this construct called the Acceptable Ads Initiative which allows them to block ads that don't meet strict guidelines set by the Adblock Plus administrators. This allows certain websites to profit off of ads which have been deemed unintrusive, so that the end user does not have to suffer from incredibly distracting ads while still allowing the website to be profitable. 

If this is unacceptable to the user, each user can independently disable this option in the settings menu for a completely ad-free environment.

Hey guys, if you want to block ads even if they paid to be let through, click on your extension, go to the bottom saying Options at the bottom of the GUI, and customize it there.

Ads suck.
With ABP, you get no more annoying ads. No ads on YouTube videos, websites articles, adf.ly, and if there is a specific ad or image that remains, you can manually block it. ABP is pretty great!
-------------------------

Easy to use.  It is great for blocking ads, especially ads that appear to be tech support and error messages.  Also helps large pages with huge numbers of ads load faster.  (I do sympathize with companies who provide news or tools for free, and I do disable Ad Blocker on those websites, for example newspaper websites, provided the ads are not excessive or confusing.  That is easy to do, just click on the ABP stopsign and deselect "Enabled on this site".)  To sum up, I've used ABP for years and I highly recommend it.

Absolutely fantastic app.

I do not feel the least bit guilty, because I have no intention of clicking the ads in the first place.

If you are a heavy consumer, then let the ads flow. Otherwise, install this fantastic app.

@Rilriia Kilurden I wish we all knew how everything works before we could review them. For example, to tell my friend how much I like my new apartment, that it doesn't have a damp problem or it is airy, I perhaps should know what is a Tartan Grid, how the Fenestration structurally interacts with the Miesian parti despite being an afterthought. Given your tone of (relatively) great expertise on matters of advertisements on the Internet, you must have surely understood what this 'amateur' is talking about and also the amount of truth in the words. Yes, it does block ads which cover most of the page i.e. be intrusive. Yes, there are intrusive ads which, on clicking 'x' or 'close', redirect to the respective link being advertised and literally trick us. To end my statement, the review is accurate, helpful and not intellectually grating; your reply is not.

Time to me is more precious than anything else.  Having to click away all the annoying ads, or having to waste my time watching a 30 second video that is unskippable to watch a 2 minute tutorial is absurd.  I havnt had any problems (Including youtube, it works fine for me) and this has saved me time from 30,000 ads.  

My time is worth more than the pennies the corporate giants get from me seeing their intrusive ad.

The best feature, honestly, is the option to turn it off for certain sites. Some sites will just plague you with ads, but others are legitimate sites trying to just make a small bit of money from ads. As long as the ads are unintrusive, I will turn it off for a site.

great resource. my son adds it to my web browsers to keep spam adverts off my system and he even adds custom lists, for my personal prefs and it doesn't bog down my system!

GREAT EVEN FOR OLD LADIES! tested on an ASUS running Win 8.1 64-bit -touchscreen

5 STARS [smooth as silk now], and now that FanBoy's list has been added to EasyList it's 10 Stars!

note: supports international lists, so you can get comprehensive ad blocking coverage, in any region and if malwared? install the south pacific lists; especially CHINA!*

*they are why we need ad block by default and a script blocker/flash blocker. waiting on NoScript for Chrome! :D

SEE?! EVEN OLD LADIES CAN USE/INSTALL THIS! ;)

best darn app yet being using it for several years and no add on pages i view i put it on because my children were seeing scantly clad women  to which one clicked and saw more than he  wanted to, 'porn'.

This is wonderful!  The best way to test is to go to your favorite websites, Disable it, see all of the ads, then enable it, click refresh and see the difference.  On some sites it cuts the load time  in half.

Works at blocking almost all ads. The ads that aren't blocked already can be right clicked and blocked manually, and once this is done they will never appear again on your pc. Excellent extension.

Does a great job keeping annoying adds off the page. 
Blocks some non-add content too.

Always awesome! The only option that I ever have to manually turn on is the blocker list for warnings about AdBlock being installed.

Works great! Easy to turn off and on where adblocking limits access to content. Very robust in removing ads PLUS it allows one to kill items on pages that are irritating. It's also available from their website for android devices that are NOT rooted and it works great on those (have it on both my phone and tablet). Note that Google removed ABP for Android from the Play store because they cater to advertisers on Android -- bad act, Google.

Adblock Plus is amazing and I recommend it to everyone. It completely blocked all ads and pop-ups. I accidently clicked something that gave me a lot of pop-ups all the time, but adblock blocks it. Also in youtube, it is great to skip all the ads.
-------------------------

It is very useful. Before install this, I was faced a lot of problem in using of Chrome. Where ever i click on browser one add opens up. now I feel really happy. Thanks for this plugin. still some more plugins are adding without my notice to the browser. If that one also can be removed, feel very happy.

The web is unusable without this plugin. Browsing the web is faster and easier with this plugin. Never click a fake navigation button again thanks to this plugin. Awesome

Okay, This thing is A MUST HAVE FOR ALL PEOPLE.       Youtube has NO ADS now and I can watch videos without punching myself in the face over Ads!!!  Oh, and if you see an ad you dont want to see, right click and click on "Block Element" and WOOSH ITS GONE!!! Wow, ABP has changed my life INCREDIBLY!!!!
-------------------------

Used to love this app. I'm guessing they sold out to an ad company as it now injects an ad into every site it can. The ad consists of "**** is a feature of ***** and uses visual search technology to find you relevant and related..."

I turned off every plugin I have one at a time to determine which one was the culprit. Adblock plus was it.
-------------------------

Just installed it 5 mins ago. Went to youtube and clicked loads of random videos; not one add appeared. Usually need to skip ad after 5 seconds or close an ad box while watching a video. Good so far....
-------------------------

I haven't found an ad that it doesn't block.  It's amazing!  Doesn't slow down the PC, actually speeds it up, because unblocked ads are what slows mine down.  

Today, it stopped working for some reason.  No big deal.  I disabled it, then re-enabled it right away, and it was working fine.  5 seconds & 2 clicks, and all was good.

Though it's free, I pay the guy who does it $3/month, and I feel like *I*'m ripping HIM off.  If I could afford to give more, I would.  THAT'S how freakin' good this is!  It even stops commercials on certain websites, but Shhhhh!  Don't let the cat out of the bag.

HERE'S HOW TO ENABLE IT: 1. Go to Chrome's "Settings"
2. Go to "Extensions"
3. Next to Adblock Plus, click the "Options" link.
4. On the "Filter lists" page, click "+ Add Filter Subscription"
5. Choose one, like "EasyList (English)"
6. Click "+ Add" button.
7. After it's added, close Google Chrome.
8. YOU NOW HAVE ADBLOCK PLUS WORKING!!! You need to be subscribed to one of these filter subscriptions so ABP knows what is an Ad, and what isn't, in order to work! Simple! :) You're Welcome!

Hands down one of the best extensions available. Blocks YouTube ads, search ads, dashboard ads, Pandora ads (on and off), ads of literally every single type. The one improvement that could be made is some way to show if a full-page ad has been blocked; it is sometimes unclear whether a large ad is blocked or the page simply fails to load.

it would be awesome if it worked the other way.  In other words,  while the extension was enabled,  it would  default to NOT being on,  but when you came to a page where you wanted to use it,  you could click the ABP button and it would be ON for that site.

Great Extension !!!
Really before I was using tamper monkey scripts to achieve half of its functionality. No it is one place solution.

Gives you control to block/unblock anything, also if there are tiny adds getting through just un-tick the box saying: "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" And make sure you have both lists:
EasyList
And if you want/need (your personal choice):
Fanboy's Adblock List

You can do this by clicking "Add filter subscription" make sure you get the English ones though, or any other language you want/need.
Highly recommend this extension! Don't get the Chrome Adblock!!! They track you, this doesn't!

Why do the majority of the adds on their new accepted list have google in the urls? Did Google buy them? They claim only 25 percent want completely adfree browsing, but where do they get off taking away the option for everyone? NORMAL ADBLOCK IS BETTER! THEY DONT FORCE YOUR HAND ON ANYTHING! It works just as well too. I hope this helps someone.

I only just realised the other day when I decided to turn this off how much it has changed my web experience.

Best adblock in Town !! Removes every add visible and loads pages faster. If adds do pop up then just click the "Adblock Plus icon" in the omnibox and then click the "AD" on that page, the ad would no longer appear and it's url entry will be made in the filter list (For future reference).......

It works great pretty much EVERYWHERE except Livestream and Facebook. It prevents me from seeing a Livestream so I have to turn it off on Livestream and go through video ads. No big deal really.

I hadn't had much of a problem with ads until recently.  I'm not sure why but ads started blocking just half of an article I was reading from a legitimate site. One of the features I like best about AdBlock Plus is that it will allow you to list the sites you like and it won't block them. Prior to buying AdBlock Plus, I had subscrrbed to a much more expensive blocking service that would do the same but it was a much more involved process. With AdBlock Pus, it's so easy.

I tried AdBlock first and liked it sii I switched to AdBlock Plus for its added benefits.  I think it's nice to  buy a service like AdBlock Plus that allows you to contribute the amount of money you think it's worth, without charging you a set amount. I figure I got added benefits that AdBlock didn't have and I'm helping the company to keep the free site available for others, while I get added features.  I really love AdBlock Plus and I highly recommend it to others!

I have used this for two years at least.  Does what is says it will.  Development is consistent and frequent.  Occasionally there is a CPU hit, it gets resolved.  Very rarely there is an ad it does not catch, when reported and then blocked it usually solves this. Whitelisting sites or just pages is easy.  Thanks ABP!

Bye bye stupid ads! No more video ads or 'acceptable' ads! ABP has blocked so many annoying ads that I don't ever want to see again.

A tip: Turn on the Anti Adblock Block filter in Settings and teach the money-hungry websites a lesson by disabling their "disable your adblocker" pop-ups!
-------------------------

This app works great. I like the way you can turn off blocking for just one page. Sites to block are continually  updated within the app. The allow site feature get automatically populated when you turn off blocking to a particular site or page and the list is easy find in settings if you need to change or remove a site. Advanced features include the ability to create your own or import custom access or blocking filters/lists. You can even force an update to or edit the built in filters/lists

Agreeing with the most Recent comments (please filter reviews and read them in that order, because older reviews are not correct any more.) This ABP is now more efficient, has added features, and works very well!

I love that it has the block-element feature too, for any kind of specific page element or image you don't want to see :)

There's nothing I currently feel is missing. All I know is when I turn it off, I see how much I'm NOT missing! :)

May I ask the dev's a question? Does this actually block/skip ads in Spotify Free? Because a friend of mine gets no ads there now. Even if it doesn't, that's not a problem, just curious!

Thank you for this great extension!

I have a couple of macbook pros.
i learned not to do updates for safari, because it removed my adblock plus and i could never use it again... i have mojave on one, am not going to update it, and adblock plus is like God to me, living for two years with ads on youtube, now ad free completely...
i find every couple of weeks youtube or google comes out with a new bypass probably a trojan on a video i watch, but i found a way to stop all ads...
all you do is open the adblock plus icon on top of your screen, on CHROME, which I am using, NOT safari, it wont work on safari anymore... but on Chrome, when you install adblock plus, you get a red icon on top of screen. Click on the gear and open settings then on left go to Advanced, and then update your filter lists and you will stop all youtube ads...

I have been using ABP for years and it is a fantastic tool that has made using the internet much easier for me and I enjoy being in control of what sites I can whitelist.  I almost never see annoying pop ups and I love that I do not see advertising while watching YouTube videos.  I highly recommend this tool.  I was using this in Safari and just added it to Chrome since I have the newest version of Safari, and it honestly is not playing well with some websites I visit (website owners are not up to speed with the technology and are telling me to use other browsers), so I am using Chrome on my Mac more frequently.  I will also be downloading this for Edge if it is available (for my laptop).  Thanks for a great extension!

You need to look into Face Book (Fluff Buster) Purity - find it on FB and follow the instructions for use on the system you use (Windows, Mac).  It works great at keeping things in check on FB, and allows you to customize settings in FB. Between this program, and FBP (Facebook Purity), I find myself well covered for my needs.

Not sure if you've found a replacement by now, but my recommendation has always been ublock origin (make sure it has origin in its name). It's simply the best blocker out there, hands down. Never experienced a single issue, not once, and it blocks absolutely everything. While at the same time giving you total control of exactly what, when, & where to block, if you choose to do so (optional, it works fine default). It's also the lightest on resources, speeding everything up instead of bogging it down. You can also add/enable/check additional filter lists in its settings. There's even one (or a few) that gets rid of all those annoying "disable adblocker" messages you were referring to.
-------------------------
list
Hands down, this is currently the best adblocking extension. It literally blocks every ad possible. I saw many people complaining about Google ads, what they need to is visit the settings page ones and disable the options for those. After doing that make sure to update your lists. It'll work perfectly fine.

I really love Adblock Plus!

It automatically blocks almost every advertisement, even the annoying popup ones on YT videos. It also makes pages load a lot faster on my outdated computer which is a huge plus.

One feature that I really like is being able to whitelist individual websites so AB+ won't block their ads. That gives me the ability to support websites that I like by allowing them to earn a little ad revenue from me. It also makes me feel like I have a lot more control over my privacy.

Adblock Plus helped me to prevent the abnormal spike (over 90%) in CPUs core temperatures that occurred upon visiting websites containing poorly coded, CPU-hogging Flash-content, be they ads or non-ads. In addition, Adblock Plus helped with taking out all the notoriously obtrusive, non-Flash Ads in some of the news-websites which offer useful content, but are bad at keeping users' interests above their clueless Ad-Sales Team's interests and their Advertisers' interests.

Moreover, allowing users to whitelist content (ads or non-ads) is the most useful feature. It may require a learning-curve for many folks, but if one can figure out the way to manage that, it offers increased value.

I highly recommend Adblock Plus to every one who desires a rewarding user-experience while making meaningful use of the Web.

Thank you Team EyeO for this great work. May the Force be with you!

Thanks for letting us know AZ EGaming! We're glad to hear you like Adblock Plus. It sounds like there's a problem with your filters, make sure they're up to date and if you need anymore help you can head over to Easy List's forum (https://forums.lanik.us/) they're responsible for our filters!

This app is perfect for getting rid of pesky ads that play before videos on YouTube, and it even has a white-list feature, so that you can still support your favorite content creators, without having annoying ads before EVERY song you listen to. I highly recommend this app! :D

I just installed it. 
At the beginning, it blocked a half of ADs. 

I tried this: 
1. go to option
2. add filter subscription
3. add English
4. untick 'Allow some non-intrusive advertising' 

Then it works well.

This is awesome. Only thing I would change is the fact that you have to manually opt out of the automatic whitelist mode.

ABP has really gone downhill. uBlock Origin is much more effective. 

Now that ABP accepts money from a couple large conglomerates (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Taboola) in exchange for being whitelisted, lots of ads just can't be blocked anymore. Just about ALL of the annoying video ads on youtube get through! Not to mention all the tracking happening through cookies, etc.

uBlock Origin is now a much better blocker, and uses significantly less system memory/resources as well.
-------------------------
whitelist
I love this app. It is absolutely amazing. Some websites have begun to block ABP users or mandate the user to "whitelist" their website. I don't. I bounce and move to the next. There are other ways to monetize your efforts besides pasting advertisements all over your website...
-------------------------
list
I got to know this app when  I was searching for a solution to remove the ads from YouTube and after installing it, it works seamlessly and does not show a single ad in the video or on the suggestions list. Great work ad block!! I would recommend this to everyone who doesn't want to see any ads in the future. Also, it works for any website too!
-------------------------

It is really good extension and allows me to access the web without any irritating ads and popups. Also, I can simply block more elements through this and also whitelist ads.

We'd love to help you out some more Felica, could you send us  more details such as which website(s) do you see that, screenshots of the ads/popups, as well as screenshots of your filters and custom filters.

Adblock is selling ads via a built-in hardcoded whitelist, making it useless for ad blocking. Go with uBlock Origin which is 500x better!

Hey Chris!

No matter whether a company pays or not (and only the biggest ones do) their ads still have to meet our Acceptable Ads criteria - there's no ifs, ands or buts about that!
 
You can check out our blog post here https://adblockplus.org/blog/fact-checking-adblock-plus-allegations! Number 2 in particular talks about how companies are added to the whitelist.

Still getting a ton of pop-up windows, from a ton of scam companies, with a fresh install so no mal-ware, no viruses no nothing.

So clearly you are either taking money from these companies to add them to a back-end whitelist or they have a found a method of working around the ad-block extension and very tight chrome settings.
-------------------------

The ad removal is great, but the extension needs more filters - like those in the original Adblock. In terms of ad removal Adblock Plus does a better job compared to Adblock.

This is a great plugin. I am guessing all the 1-star reviews are from morons, or people hired by a competing product.  I love Adblock Plus.  Over 10 million users does not scream 1-star product to me.  I accidentally installed AdBlock on one of my computers instead of Adblock Plus and was shocked at how many ads it failed to block.  Installed Adblock Plus instead and POOF, back to normal.  I have given multiple donations to the developer.  I appreciate that you have the option of getting down into the base level of being able to write your own filters if you need to.

Works as indicated. I don't like that I can't see what is being blocked. Maybe a list or something would be nice.

Works wonderfully. Whitelist the people on YouTube you want to support, otherwise screw it and you will be browsing ad free. I have not seen an ad pop up in years. I hate ads, this is an awesome app. I use it along with Ghostery and AdBlock Plus.

Used this for years happily. Gotta say I'm disappointed to find out it has now begun to sell advertisement white-list spots.

Works PERFECTLY!!!!!!

To all of you who claim that AdBlock Plus is NOT doing its job - START READING BELOW!

A big thank you in advance, Elad Karako! YOU, Sir, saved me years of headaches. Wish I had discovered this years ago...

Posted by Elad Karako, Dec 4, 2015:

"1. you should remove the checkmark from "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" in the extension settings :)

2. 
also- add few other lists from this post:
http://icompile.eladkarako.com/adblock-lists/

the most intrusive ads can be blocked even before you open your browser using your computer's DNS service (google "blocking ads using HOSTS file")

anyway me and few others are maintaining a list of those bad domains (tracking, ads, popups, malware)

the lists are published at https://github.com/eladkarako/hosts.eladkarako.com
and I've added a new AdBlock list named "hosts_adblock" which is useful if you don't want to use your computer's HOSTS file, but still want to block all those ads.

it updates few times a week.
direct links:

the "hosts_adblock" list:
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts_adblock.txt

the HOSTS files:
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts0.txt
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts.txt

the plain domain list:<br>http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts_raw.txt

hope you'll find it useful, I've never saw a single ad for 3 years now :))))"

i may have to white list my websites one by one but thank god no more pop-ups from wonderlandads

'Hated it'is a bit strong but this was a great blocker but they have now done a deal with The Dark Side - Google, Amazon, Microsoft,Taboola,Outbrain and Criteo all pay Adblock Plus huge fees to add their ads to the Adblock Plus whitelist therefore This is most Definitely NOT an Adblocker anymore!
-------------------------

Works well, just setting up a new PC and added this again. Combine it with Better Popup Blocker and you ready for anything. Better Popup Blocker isn't listed here any more, but get it from Softpedia and just drop the .crx file into chrome extensions.

Love the new changes, letting through proper ads if you want, and blocking dangerous and annoying ones. All it needs is YouTube, Twitch, Hitbox, and Wikipedia whitelisted by default and it'll be flawless! ^_^

extremely good at blocking pop up and embedded (in-page) adds. Also allows you to add a white list and blocker lists update frequently.

It's ok. Don't like having to use Block lists so will try another.

I've been using it for years, and it's absolutely wonderful. The trick is to get the right filter! I use EasyList, Malware Domains, & EasyPrivacy.

It's a great tool. Easy to turn off, easy to customize what should get blocked. Simple interface, although the pseudo-regex (using wildcards) pattern you need to use to add to the blocked list is a little tricky... still, it never crashes and doesn't slow down Chrome!

clean app which filters all ads

Remember to white-list Youtube and Twitch because the people on the sites usually rely completely on ads for income, but a great program, 10/10.
-------------------------

Everyone who has a problem with ads still popping up, right click on the icon, click "options", make sure that both "Adblock Warning Removal List" and "EasyList" are checked, and uncheck "Allow some non-intrusive advertising".
This is a great application and should be used by everyone!

More and more ads getting through. Could these be from those "ACCEPTABLE ad" providers that pay ABP to get whitelisted?

betafish seems to do the job better with the nice right click functions...

great resource. my son adds it to my web browsers to keep spam adverts off my system and he even adds custom lists, for my personal prefs and it doesn't bog down my system!

GREAT EVEN FOR OLD LADIES! tested on an ASUS running Win 8.1 64-bit -touchscreen

5 STARS [smooth as silk now], and now that FanBoy's list has been added to EasyList it's 10 Stars!

note: supports international lists, so you can get comprehensive ad blocking coverage, in any region and if malwared? install the south pacific lists; especially CHINA!*

*they are why we need ad block by default and a script blocker/flash blocker. waiting on NoScript for Chrome! :D

SEE?! EVEN OLD LADIES CAN USE/INSTALL THIS! ;)

So far I like the control options listed. This is a lot to offer from an app that is integrated into a web browser for free. From what I can so far see and have experienced the advertisements are being kept to a "controlled low". Best app, download this one.

Works wonders!  It blocks all of the annoying ads and discretely hides them away.  Webpages are presented as they should be sans the advertising.  It occurred to me how well this extension works when I used a friends' computer which was not running Adblock Plus.  I couldn't believe how many ads this extension blocks!  However, this extension is not perfect.  The only drawback I have found is that it will incorrectly block the basic functionality of certain websites.  This can be easily fixed by adding the site to your "Whitelist".  I gave it five stars because this is one of the essential extensions you should use! I have used this on Opera and Firefox as well.  Works just as well on any browser.
-------------------------

This is the most useful extension that I've seen so far! And it's easy to use - you just add some of the preset filters, which are divided by country. You can also easily block ads, which are not in the filters. I definitely recommend AdBlock+!

755,254 Ads blocked by this Noble Prize worthy piece of software. This lifesaver has saved my visual cortex from having to process a gazillion gigabytes of advertisements. I'm in the developers of this software debt. For the newbs, you have to select and download a filter list. I use Easy and Adblock custom. In addition if you view the "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" list, select, copy, and paste it in to "Add your own filters" Chrome will be hitting 88 mph and you'll be seeing some plutonium speeds!

Works well, but it seems slow and Chrome keeps hanging up on "Waiting for extension Adblock Plus."  Would also be nice to see a list of what ads were blocked instead of just a count.
-------------------------
list
Excellent extension and I really like the (opt-out) exception made for non-intrusive adverts. My only complaint would be that the firstrun screen has useful configuration options which don't appear in the main program options.

Even more useful would be a way to see how many items were blocked by each list, thus allowing you to eliminate lists which weren't pulling their weight.
-------------------------

Like Joe Papp, I don't like the choice you've made to move the Icon outside of the addressbar.

Please could you move it back OR Implement an Option so users can choose.

I've also been unable to whitelist specific URLs, I am only able to whitelist the whole website and Not certain pages.

Actual use:

WONDERFUL. I've tried using No Adblock for a week and there are some Ads that get on more nerve! (Giant Flash ones etc on Normal Websites).

This solves it for me.
-------------------------

Awesome.  Makes the Internet tolerable.  Works on almost all ads.  However, Youtube and others are now embedding ads into their content which makes it harder to remove.  You will need to create custom filters and see if this successfully removes them for you.

easy to use and not too complicated to configure either.
it would be great if you could add a new feature, to right click the icon in the address bar, and select add domain to whitelist. I use this feature often.

Stopped blocking ads for me within the last few days, but i went into the options (from extensions page) and realized i needed to add a filter 'subscription' (Easylist) again. not sure why it went away, but for anybody confused about seeing ads, try this! BTW, adblock plus makes the internet a wonderful place, thanks so much for all your effort devs. ALL CREDIT GOES TO BRAD LORENZEN
-------------------------

HERE'S HOW TO ENABLE IT: 1. Go to Chrome's "Settings"
2. Go to "Extensions"
3. Next to Adblock Plus, click the "Options" link.
4. On the "Filter lists" page, click "+ Add Filter Subscription"
5. Choose one, like "EasyList (English)"
6. Click "+ Add" button.
7. After it's added, close Google Chrome.
8. YOU NOW HAVE ADBLOCK PLUS WORKING!!! You need to be subscribed to one of these filter subscriptions so ABP knows what is an Ad, and what isn't, in order to work! Simple! :) You're Welcome!
-------------------------
filter
This is working fine, and I had the same problem as everyone else here. Perhaps the author of the program should note this: The filters were somehow disabled, whether by a crafty website or via update bug. Just go into the ABP settings and select to add filers. Choose the language filter that suits you and WALLA! it works perfectly again. I hope this helps.

Excellent app used on my laptop and android. Sometimes websites get cheeky and sneak through ads but this is by far the best out there. If, for some reason, ads do come through it's always just been a case of double-checking the settings and making sure an active filter is in use. Apart from that odd hiccup, awesome!

I have had this extension for a few months and I completely love it. It is a MUST! However, just recently I noticed that some google ads started to pass through. I searched for a solution and found that you have to add easylist as a filter in the extension's settings. Afterwards it works perfectly again.
-------------------------

Excellent add-on, makes the web useable again, and I like the it has an option to allow non-intrusive ads, I don't mind google ads for example, I just don't want large flashing "You've won" ads everywhere I go.

Love this extension! I have whitelisted YouTube, but I heard they are going to be adding a feature where YT channels can be whitelisted. Can't wait for that to happen so I can support my favorite content creators!

5 star extension now! It works well and I can add my own custom filters/create my own personalized list, if EasyList + Annoyances + Privacy + Fanboy's ULTIMATE & COMPLETE aren't good enough! *scoffs* LOVED IT FOR FIREFOX AND LOVING IT FOR CHROME and better than IE9/ie10's current versions (a bit buggy-ie10), but haven't had any issues, with this extension acting up, or crashing.

5 Stars, awesome extension. Blocks any ads   that I wanted to block, or the already specified filters that you guys made. I made my own filters but never released them to the public, because I felt the need they needed more  ads to be blocked. 

This is really good if you can't find a way to block ads, but I think you should add a survey remover to this. It might be nice for everyone to see a survey remover that works :) .

Pretty good plugin, I'm hoping that you took my suggestions.

Adblock Plus is a fantastic tool and add-on for Firefox, it allows you to block internet ads, block un-wanted images, which generally speeds up loading time on websites. 
It's easy to configure and has a set list of known ad suppliers to block so you don't have to input anything.

This extension works great!  For the people seeing ads after an update, or ads on certain websites, make sure your list subscriptions are checked!  I use both "Fanboy's adblock list" and "Easylist" and never see ads on any site.
-------------------------
filter
Gives you control to block/unblock anything, also if there are tiny adds getting through just un-tick the box saying: "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" And make sure you have both lists:
EasyList
And if you want/need (your personal choice):
Fanboy's Adblock List

You can do this by clicking "Add filter subscription" make sure you get the English ones though, or any other language you want/need.
Highly recommend this extension! Don't get the Chrome Adblock!!! They track you, this doesn't!
-------------------------
filter
While I loved Adblock Plus for Firefox, I don't like it for Chrome. I had to recently switch browsers and got Chrome versions of all my addons (or very similar in function equivalents), and I'm not impressed with how this one works. A lot of advertisement went through, if I right-click to block an ad, nothing happens, and nothing gets put into the custom filter. It was honestly a much more reliable addon for firefox and much simpler  there as well.

I switched to the other "Adblock" addon, and I have to say that it does the job I require and it is so much simpler to add custom filters, and it uses all the same filters (EasyList, Fanboy, etc) as this one!
-------------------------
list
Why do the majority of the adds on their new accepted list have google in the urls? Did Google buy them? They claim only 25 percent want completely adfree browsing, but where do they get off taking away the option for everyone? NORMAL ADBLOCK IS BETTER! THEY DONT FORCE YOUR HAND ON ANYTHING! It works just as well too. I hope this helps someone.

If this extension can stop the pop-ups, it would be the best Google Chrome extension.

Best adblock in Town !! Removes every add visible and loads pages faster. If adds do pop up then just click the "Adblock Plus icon" in the omnibox and then click the "AD" on that page, the ad would no longer appear and it's url entry will be made in the filter list (For future reference).......

Great extension. Personally it's easier to configure than the other version of Adblock to, which is nice. For those of you having issues with Ad's coming through the blocker, try going into the options and adding the Fanboys List if you don't already have it. After I did adverts everywhere vanished. Great add on!

Adblock without a plus is a much better extension it blocks more adverts and supports local lists and custom add servers. this plus version I uninstalled within 2 minutes as it could not block adds from the main info portals.

This is one of my favourite extensions in the Google Chrome store.

It works like a charm, especially after adding extra subscriptions.  

Website s are now a pleasure to read and I can actually follow the flow of the content. I especially like the complete absence of popups and other Flash nonsense.

The only feature I miss from the Firefox version is the "disable for this site" option on the button that automatically adds the current site to the whitelist.

All-in-all, I love the extension and keep up the good work!

it's better than ADB,but lack of convenience of making your own filter rules while navigating on sites.

the free version is very impressive. I pay a lot for internet access, and my provider was making ads pop up beside my email and eating up a FIFTH (1/5TH) of my screen. Not anymore. Thanks Ad Blocker. Plus there is help to ease altering browser settings associated with Ad Blocker setting when necessary.
Overall a worthwhile plugin to a browser to ease the torrent of what I call , junk mail on line.

I have been using ABP for years and it is a fantastic tool that has made using the internet much easier for me and I enjoy being in control of what sites I can whitelist.  I almost never see annoying pop ups and I love that I do not see advertising while watching YouTube videos.  I highly recommend this tool.  I was using this in Safari and just added it to Chrome since I have the newest version of Safari, and it honestly is not playing well with some websites I visit (website owners are not up to speed with the technology and are telling me to use other browsers), so I am using Chrome on my Mac more frequently.  I will also be downloading this for Edge if it is available (for my laptop).  Thanks for a great extension!

Hi!

We  are releasing a fix for this soon. In the meantime, try installing Adblock plus on the Dev version of Chrome. You can download that version here https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/. Install Adblock Plus here https://adblockplus.org. Feel free to contact us if you have any more questions!

Thanks

thanks you for blocking all this adds for me!
There's no much difference between the plus and the regular version, so go for any of them!
I got pop ups windows in certain sites :( so i close them quickly! I deserve it after all they were sites to watch videos for free... HAHA!
-------------------------
version
Best Version of AdBlock! EVER!
-------------------------
version
THIS IS THE CORRECT VERSION, THERE WAS A VERSION GOING AROUND NOT TOO LONG AGO, IT HAD THE SAME NAME AND LOOK!... BYT THIS IS DEFINTLY THE 1 FOR ME, AS IT STOPS ALL POP UPS!, WHICH IS GREAT.. BUT 1 OR 2 A DAY WOULD BE NICE!, (IF ITS AN OFFER?)...LOL, 10/10 FOR THIS 1.. SERIOUSLY GUYS, THERE ARE LOTS OUT THERE, BUT THEY SIMPLY DONT DO WHAT THIS APP DOES! & THATS TO BLOCK THE ADS!!!.
-------------------------
version
I have been using adblock Puse version since I had read online that it blocked the unwanted ads and loads webpage faster and prevents malware and viruses from entering through various links which is great and best of all it is easy to use.
-------------------------
version
the android version is very effective so why not try it on my pc as well? :)
-------------------------
version
perfect for free version. but its annoying for popping up all the time when you open your chrome
-------------------------
version
Oh and thanks to the creators of this 'new and improved' version.... It's nice to know your company no longer cares about MY privacy, which is evident since you allow data mining (demographic collected) ads to ... collect information about me.

No, really, thanks. Thanks SO much.

corrupt
never works for me. always get "extension corrupt" error only with ad-block. all other extensions work perfectly fine.
-------------------------
version
This is letting ads through. For being the "plus" version, it sure is worse than the original adblock. Adblock actually blocks all ads, unlike adblock plus.
-------------------------
version
In one word,  it's perfect.

hope to get a mobile version soon.......... loved it.
-------------------------
version
Very good! It works on older versions of Chrome but it doesn't block text-based advertisements.
-------------------------
version
Would be five stars but the chrome version is sometimes kind of buggy.   Not as user friendly as the firefox version of same. 
Still, really really really good.  A necessity as far as I'm concerned.
-------------------------
version
This is the real one! Downloaded a fake one and took forever to get rid of it. Watch out for the malware versions.

Again this is the real deal...and it works great!
-------------------------
version
Wish I had the pop up blocker version as well. This does a great job otherwise.
-------------------------
version
Blocks all useless ads.
it is better than paid version :)
-------------------------
version
If you are getting adds in youtube when this is enabled you need to disable the other version of flash in your browser. Do a simple google search to find out how..  Works great!!
-------------------------
version
It was working until the new Chrome 31 Update. Now it just works randomly. I would appreciate an updated version.
-------------------------
version
5 star extension now! It works well and I can add my own custom filters/create my own personalized list, if EasyList + Annoyances + Privacy + Fanboy's ULTIMATE & COMPLETE aren't good enough! *scoffs* LOVED IT FOR FIREFOX AND LOVING IT FOR CHROME and better than IE9/ie10's current versions (a bit buggy-ie10), but haven't had any issues, with this extension acting up, or crashing. SO FAR SO GOOD! A SPECIAL THANKS TO THE DEV! YOU ROCK! THANKS! ~S~
-------------------------
version
latest version very good
-------------------------
version
The non-plus version is far superior. Don't accept imitation!
-------------------------
version
It was a perfect adblock extension until Google Chrome version 26.0.1410.63 arrived.
-------------------------
version
Works just like the Firefox version, which is why I use Firefox, now I can use Chrome.
-------------------------
version
Great extension - Does what it says. Chrome version is a little off, but I can't complain too much. YouTube browsing is 100% more enjoyable.
-------------------------
version
It's awesome,
The newer version does that automatically.
It's really intelligent. :)
-------------------------
version
I love this more than the other normal version, with this PLUS version you can add your trusted domains and (flash players) if they got blocked by default.
-------------------------
version
not as good as the firefox version, but works for some sites.
-------------------------
version
I don't like the fact that it doesn't work as well a it does in FF. The ads actually load, and I can see them for a second, and then they disappear. The FF version prevents them from loading completely. Still nice though. 4/5
-------------------------
version
While I loved Adblock Plus for Firefox, I don't like it for Chrome. I had to recently switch browsers and got Chrome versions of all my addons (or very similar in function equivalents), and I'm not impressed with how this one works. A lot of advertisement went through, if I right-click to block an ad, nothing happens, and nothing gets put into the custom filter. It was honestly a much more reliable addon for firefox and much simpler  there as well.

I switched to the other "Adblock" addon, and I have to say that it does the job I require and it is so much simpler to add custom filters, and it uses all the same filters (EasyList, Fanboy, etc) as this one!
-------------------------
version
I hate ads. AdBlock Plus stops advertisers wasting my screen space and bandwidth. Thank you for an excellent, free extension.

Btw, I'm one of the people who hates all ads, so I opted out of the acceptable/non-intrusive ads in the latest version.
-------------------------
version
It is great compared to "adblock"  the version without plus at the end. This version blocks everything including video commercials.
-------------------------
version
Much better than the other 'AdBlock' extension. This one has been around for a very long time, and gets 99% of ads, and who cares about the rare ones that might pop up. The 'AdBlock' version uses a very sluggish method, and cannot display pages  correctly until after it is fully modified. It also increases cpu usage significantly and will drink up netbook batterys like gaterade. This is the best choice for almost every situation. Webpages load FASTER due to less work being done, not slower due to the method the other one uses.
-------------------------
version
Best add blocker that I know of! I used to use it in Firefox and it worked great, now in chrome only a few things have changed; it's still the best one by far. Though it's not as good as the Firefox version, It still blocks all the adds on every website I've been on without blocking good content (it even works for GrooveShark!)
-------------------------
version
Much better than the earlier versions. Keep it up!
-------------------------
version
I love this so much Especially on sites with adult related advertisements. Great for parents with kids. The "Beta" is better than the full version. I recommend this to all my fellow Chrome users.
-------------------------
version
Works Great!
If only we could have tabs on Java and Flash like FF version of ABP. :)
-------------------------
version
This works great. even easier to use than the Firefox version. I love it!
-------------------------
version
Great extension. Personally it's easier to configure than the other version of Adblock to, which is nice. For those of you having issues with Ad's coming through the blocker, try going into the options and adding the Fanboys List if you don't already have it. After I did adverts everywhere vanished. Great add on!
-------------------------
version
Adblock without a plus is a much better extension it blocks more adverts and supports local lists and custom add servers. this plus version I uninstalled within 2 minutes as it could not block adds from the main info portals.
-------------------------
version
Epic like Firefox version.
-------------------------
version
This is one of my favourite extensions in the Google Chrome store.

It works like a charm, especially after adding extra subscriptions.  

Website s are now a pleasure to read and I can actually follow the flow of the content. I especially like the complete absence of popups and other Flash nonsense.

The only feature I miss from the Firefox version is the "disable for this site" option on the button that automatically adds the current site to the whitelist.

All-in-all, I love the extension and keep up the good work!
-------------------------
version
should make it like the firefox version where you can block a frame or ad just by right clicking it
-------------------------
version
Yeah me to there's a ton of ads coming through.  Adplus NORMAL version still works great.  Help please?
-------------------------
version
I used Ad Block Plus with Firefox and I loved it.  This one works well but doesn't block all of the advertisements in video sites like South Park Studios and Hulu, for example.  It still works well, but that's one thing that the firefox version has over this one for Chrome.  If this could be fixed it would be fantastic and I'd give this app five stars.  Thank you!
-------------------------

I can't believe I've been using the old version and not Adblock Plus for all these years! Finally found this last night when setting up Chrome on my laptop, just got it running on my PC and everything loads super fast now!

The only thing missing is getting the settings to sync between devices, but other than that...excellent!

This is such a useful tool ... should be built into all existing browsers by default :)

Ironically, by default you will receive notifications, also known as ADS, asking how you feel about this extension, etc. I highly recommend turning these off through AdBlock's control panel. Otherwise, does the job quite well!
-------------------------
config
It just works.

Used it for 2 years. Has never gotten in the way. Only does good things. There have only been a small number of websites that it hasn't blocked ads on, how ever the results are the same as a good DNS sinkhole config. The plugin is as good as it gets for client side ad-blocking.
-------------------------
default
This Ad blocker is amazing. Ad Block Plus has a couple of options in the settings to customize web page experience. Or you can just use the default setting, which works great for blocking unwanted and sometimes even harmful ads. I highly recommended.
-------------------------
default
Not sure if you've found a replacement by now, but my recommendation has always been ublock origin (make sure it has origin in its name). It's simply the best blocker out there, hands down. Never experienced a single issue, not once, and it blocks absolutely everything. While at the same time giving you total control of exactly what, when, & where to block, if you choose to do so (optional, it works fine default). It's also the lightest on resources, speeding everything up instead of bogging it down. You can also add/enable/check additional filter lists in its settings. There's even one (or a few) that gets rid of all those annoying "disable adblocker" messages you were referring to.
-------------------------

ebay has been very slow for me lately, i was watching all these ad-server url's in the progress box, so i installed this app, Adblock Plus, left on default settings and now it blocks 18 elements on every ebay page refresh and it's MUCH faster loading the content ... THIS IS A GREAT APP !
-------------------------
default
One of the best.
- Super fast, 
- Light (1.5MB), 
- No white-list by default,
- Not asking me to share my personal information.
-------------------------

A necessity in today's ad-driven world.
Great options to block what doesn't get blocked by default.
Incredibly "tune-able."
Thanks.

No sync

It's fantastic! Especially for the increasing number of adverts on YouTube and other such spammy sites.
HOWEVER it does, by default block all images on google photos, but that's Ok because you can disable the blocker for such situations.
You can also disable the blocker for sites you wish to support, like charities and freeware sites.
Keep up the good job!
-------------------------
config
Simplest interface and config of the official ones that just works.
-------------------------

Love the new changes, letting through proper ads if you want, and blocking dangerous and annoying ones. All it needs is YouTube, Twitch, Hitbox, and Wikipedia whitelisted by default and it'll be flawless! ^_^
-------------------------
default
Should be default ad blocker for chrome
-------------------------
default
great resource. my son adds it to my web browsers to keep spam adverts off my system and he even adds custom lists, for my personal prefs and it doesn't bog down my system!

GREAT EVEN FOR OLD LADIES! tested on an ASUS running Win 8.1 64-bit -touchscreen

5 STARS [smooth as silk now], and now that FanBoy's list has been added to EasyList it's 10 Stars!

note: supports international lists, so you can get comprehensive ad blocking coverage, in any region and if malwared? install the south pacific lists; especially CHINA!*

*they are why we need ad block by default and a script blocker/flash blocker. waiting on NoScript for Chrome! :D

SEE?! EVEN OLD LADIES CAN USE/INSTALL THIS! ;)
-------------------------
default
SUPERB extension. multy-browser support. 

to those who does not like TEXT-based ads: there is a check box "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" in settings (it is enabled by default)
-------------------------
default
Not coded carefully.
Making it's work, really fine but using too much resources as well. And inside it's files  keeping unnecessary things like built in coming jquery UI default interface images etc. The unused files in frameworks also needs to be deleted.

Conclusion, nice but need optimization
-------------------------
default
Allows non intrusive advertising by default... Other than that awesome...
-------------------------
default
The MUST extension !!!!
We will never say it enough times.

It saves your brain attention to serve you to focus on just the worth from the web that you are looking for.

It should be embedded by default in any browsers.

(Why is it still in Beta?)
-------------------------
default
The best adblocker on the planet! Be sure to add all the available block lists; they're not installed/turned on by default.
-------------------------
default
I love this more than the other normal version, with this PLUS version you can add your trusted domains and (flash players) if they got blocked by default.
-------------------------
default
it would be awesome if it worked the other way.  In other words,  while the extension was enabled,  it would  default to NOT being on,  but when you came to a page where you wanted to use it,  you could click the ABP button and it would be ON for that site.
-------------------------
sync
Nice and easy to use.
Thanks to that surfing on the web is way more how it supposed to be!

-1 star because:
Unfortunately there is no such thing as preference-sync via Chrome. It would be the best extension i've ever used it the manual grown blocking-list would be synced.

Thanks guys!

Simply the best addon on the store, a literal life changer. You won't appreciate how much time & sanity it saves you until logging into a public or friend's PC later on and seeing all the repulsive, dehumanizing litter that are web ads. It isn't designed to block cookies and the like so if you want to go full in on blocking those an alternative browser altogether is your best bet. As for this, it's insane that it's both this effective and this free. They never intrusively ask but you can donate to them, highly recommend. Peace of mind is priceless

Great browser extension, extremely easy to set up upon first use using the settings that are web-based basically on a web page and to configure everything on the first run - thankfully when I bought a used Google Chromebook from Acer, once I sign into Gmail slash Google, Adblock Plus was pulled in from my I guess Windows 10 desktop PC and other places I was happy to not have to go download this again. It's a little confusing that there's an ad block I guess basic, and Adblock Plus, and I think there's an Adblock Pro which is maybe a subscription or annual payment model - hopefully this is not the freemium model or bait and switch Etc. Very pleased with configuring settings and letting be browser extension hideout in the background nice and quietly. Kudos 5 of 5 stars!

I have a couple of macbook pros.
i learned not to do updates for safari, because it removed my adblock plus and i could never use it again... i have mojave on one, am not going to update it, and adblock plus is like God to me, living for two years with ads on youtube, now ad free completely...
i find every couple of weeks youtube or google comes out with a new bypass probably a trojan on a video i watch, but i found a way to stop all ads...
all you do is open the adblock plus icon on top of your screen, on CHROME, which I am using, NOT safari, it wont work on safari anymore... but on Chrome, when you install adblock plus, you get a red icon on top of screen. Click on the gear and open settings then on left go to Advanced, and then update your filter lists and you will stop all youtube ads...
ADBLOCK PLUS, i love you, saving me data way out in the bush using my phone... thank you guys you are tops...

This works. Like definitely works. I've been using it for a while, and I've only seen one ad. In any case where you see one just report it, it's not that hard. Also make sure you have 'Acceptable Ads' off. And of course, an ad will find a way through, which is why all ad blockers have to update. I don't know why people are having speed problems because Chrome's speed has been completely fine for me. It's a great ad blocker, and i'd recommend it. (✿◡‿◡)

This is really good. I go to sites (especially YouTube) that give me countless of annoying ads, i got sick of that and installed this ABP to my Chrome. It works so well. Just as soon as i got it, boom! no more ads. This works so well, ty
-------------------------
browser
This is by far the most useful extension. A must on each browser.

I'd like this extension to be available in mobile chrome too. A big thank you from me!
-------------------------
chrome
I absolutely love it. While yes some website force you to disable it, on websites that let you continue even with it on makes my experience better on said websites. This extension makes my experience on chrome much better because it blocks most ads that I normally would encounter. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an adblocker.
-------------------------
browser
Still love this app.  This is a must-have for any supported browser.  I love how it filters out ads and compresses the web pages so you don't get a lot of empty boxes.  Just wondering when they'll put it out of beta.
**UPDATE** I've been using this extension for years and I still love it!  It's much better than the rest.  I didn't think they would still be around anymore, but they're still kickin'!  Thanks!
-------------------------
chrome
Best chrome extension ever! It blocks those annoying ads in youtube and this definitely smoothen my experience in it. 

Again, many thanks to the developer, much appreciate to your effort.
-------------------------
chrome
I have used this extension for 7 years now and have loved it. Some sites are getting "smart" and try to block the ad blocker. I just move on to a new site that won't force a million clickbait ads on me. The best Chrome extension I have ever used.
-------------------------
chrome
I am getting an amazing ad-free and trackers free experiance in google chrome. Surely, this is the best AD-BLOCKER for google chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
Excellent Chrome extension app!  It does everything it advertises and MORE.  5 thumbs-up!
-------------------------
chrome
Useful light add-on that does not cause lag and allows many websites access ads-free. Loved the app. Should have some feature to prioritize add-ons. Sometimes chrome starts promptly without loading add-on and i have to refresh the page. Thank you developers.
-------------------------
chrome
its really epic

i only had it for a bit but its really good
haven't seen a single ad since i got this on chrome
-------------------------
browser
been using this for years. If I change browser or reformat my PC, adblock is definitely one of the things-to-add list.
-------------------------
chrome
Works great! Blocks video ads on windows, chrome os, mac, and much more! Blocks video ads too!
-------------------------
browser
I really loved this adblocker, it can block all of the ads in a page and show properly how many ads were blocked in the page that you are currently at and how many the extension blocked since it was installed in your browser.
-------------------------
chrome
this 'abp' thing is way too good. It's PERFECT!!! No ads, no pop ups...ETC. Gonna rate this thing 5 stars. Also got the Edge extension(so not only the chrome one). Your companion AdBlock, is also a suggestion
-------------------------
chrome
The best AdBlock extension for Chrome without a doubt. Plenty of settings and features, easy to disable on specific websites when needed with the ability to add custom filters and has worked 100% reliably since I installed it years ago.
-------------------------
chrome
this is the best ad blocker ı have ever seen in my life I think that this is the best ad blocker that I could find for chrome. It blocks any ad from any website, including YouTube, that does not have the images embedded into the page. Everything runs so much better and it does not take up any space. There are still those websites that make you disable ad blockers, but that is the only think that could get around it. Overall, this is a great extension to chrome. I would highly recommend this to everyone!

chrome
add on wajib setiap kali install chrome, sangat membantu sekali saat browsing di web
-------------------------
chrome
This adblocker is amazing if you throw in some other filters its perfect Again google chrome's ad filter sucks!
-------------------------
chrome
I've been using this extension for around 3 or 4 years now, and it has worked amazingly! Of course, there are some times when the extension needs to be turned off because the acceptable ads policy isn't on a specific website, but that rarely ever happens. All in all, a must-have for anyone using Chrome.

An excellent Chrome extension that allows you to easily block ads. It is customizable and convenient.

-------------------------
chrome
Wenn ich ehrlich bin weiß ich nicht was viele haben. Ich mag den Adblocker. Er macht was er soll. Nur leider habe ich mitbekommen dass er auf Twitch.TV und Spotify nicht funktioniert. Stört mich nicht weiter weil ich Spotify Premium hab und bei Twitch ist es nur eine Werbung am Anfang eines Live Streams. Das es Chrome verlangsamen soll oder sehr viel CPU Leistung zieht kann ich auch nicht bestätigen. 5 Sterne auf jeden Fall wert.
-------------------------

A great extension for google chrome browser. Reduces pages loading time a lot and helps with limited internet bandwidth. You have multiple options to help you blocking and unblocking certain ads when you need.
-------------------------

Extremely useful feature. I literally don't use Chrome without it or rather, I make sure I use it with Youtube.
-------------------------

Best Ad blocker for Chrome and no other can do better than this extension. Must add to chrome.
-------------------------

This is a wonderful extension, it removes all ads from youtube so it doesn't disturb my videos. One question to the creator or whoever knows, does this add the annoying extension Any Search Engine? It keeps taking over my Google Chrome and I have no idea if it's related to this extension or not. Thank you.
-------------------------

Thank you for making the browser function like it's intended, pop ups and ads ruin my experience and having an app to streamline it all down to a button is innovative and thoughtful and I appreciate it every day!

5 star please make it for Android Chrome also

browser
I have been using ABP for years and it is a fantastic tool that has made using the internet much easier for me and I enjoy being in control of what sites I can whitelist.  I almost never see annoying pop ups and I love that I do not see advertising while watching YouTube videos.  I highly recommend this tool.  I was using this in Safari and just added it to Chrome since I have the newest version of Safari, and it honestly is not playing well with some websites I visit (website owners are not up to speed with the technology and are telling me to use other browsers), so I am using Chrome on my Mac more frequently.  I will also be downloading this for Edge if it is available (for my laptop).  Thanks for a great extension!

Been using this extension for YEARS.  (knock on wood..) Never have had issue with it in Google Chrome.  Very VERY satisfied with the end result (no fuss, no mess, no FEE).  Try it.  Go ahead... ;)

Most useful chrome add-on.
-------------------------
browser
What can be said, simply the best ad blocker extension for browsers.
-------------------------
browser
Does what it's supposed to. Of course I don't have any ads to worry about on Gab, since it's crowd-sourced but on more unethical sites like Google, it comes in handy. Also using Dissenter browser helps, since Chrome is malware.

I hope the dev team works out the kinks for the samsung browser bc I've used this app on a PC for years & would love for it to work on my phone :-)

Too good! I cannot imagine using my browser without adblocker plus.
-------------------------
chrome
This is the best Chrome add on in existence. I gave this to my teacher and she loved it. And its free!!!!
-------------------------
firefox
This is by far the best ad blocker out there. Its simpler and easier to use than the other ones. While it doesn't block EVERY SINGLE AD on some pages it still offers a feature where you can manually block the element (blocking it from the code itself) so that any code like that in the elements tab wont show up on the page when you reload it. I would give 4 stars if it didn't have that feature. Overall though, Ad Blocker Plus works VERY WELL and makes load times faster than Firefox.
-------------------------
chrome
What a wonderful product!  Should be installed on every instance of Chrome without exception.

I think that this is the best ad blocker that I could find for chrome. It blocks any ad from any website, including YouTube, that does not have the images embedded into the page.

Still getting a ton of pop-up windows, from a ton of scam companies, with a fresh install so no mal-ware, no viruses no nothing.

So clearly you are either taking money from these companies to add them to a back-end whitelist or they have a found a method of working around the ad-block extension and very tight chrome settings.

-------------------------
chrome
A #1 must have for every Chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
ABP is one of the best popup blockers i have ever used. straight up. i can use it and click to play java, and i hardly ever EVER get popups, even on shady websites that are nothing BUT popups. Every time i start a new pc or have to reinstall chrome, first thing i do is add ABP.
-------------------------
chrome
Very good for blocking unwanted adds. user always have option to unblock adds from the abp icon on the chrome bar.
-------------------------
chrome
Thank you Thank you!   I had this installed via my Firefox and it worked so great I forgot it was working.   Then I was using some programs that required me to use Chrome.... Wow - a constant barrage of ads!!!  So I got to easily compare the ABP vs not installed.  I immediately installed ABP for Chrome and it was all angels and harps!   Thanks ABP for this great extension :)

One of the best extensions ever. Some ads may still pop up, but thanks to Adblock Plus, most are kept at bay, especially the spammy ones on social networking sites such as facebook. It also helps to improve the performance of your browser when playing games, as a lot of the ads that it blocks would have been using the same plug-in which games on the browser use, thus slowing down the game's functions. With this extension, your web games performance will be enhanced.

works a lot better in firefox and easier to mantain

Works PERFECTLY!!!!!!

To all of you who claim that AdBlock Plus is NOT doing its job - START READING BELOW!

A big thank you in advance, Elad Karako! YOU, Sir, saved me years of headaches. Wish I had discovered this years ago...

Posted by Elad Karako, Dec 4, 2015:

"1. you should remove the checkmark from "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" in the extension settings :)

2. 
also- add few other lists from this post:
http://icompile.eladkarako.com/adblock-lists/

the most intrusive ads can be blocked even before you open your browser using your computer's DNS service (google "blocking ads using HOSTS file")

anyway me and few others are maintaining a list of those bad domains (tracking, ads, popups, malware)

the lists are published at https://github.com/eladkarako/hosts.eladkarako.com
and I've added a new AdBlock list named "hosts_adblock" which is useful if you don't want to use your computer's HOSTS file, but still want to block all those ads.

it updates few times a week.
direct links:

the "hosts_adblock" list:
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts_adblock.txt

the HOSTS files:
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts0.txt
http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts.txt

the plain domain list:<br>http://hosts.eladkarako.com/hosts_raw.txt

hope you'll find it useful, I've never saw a single ad for 3 years now :))))"

Does good job over ublock, though I used before ublock, noticed  many non-english websites with builtin adults ads.
this ext. blocks, but ublock does not. it's simple as that.
why not excellent and 5 stras? s
it's simple. 
because and this and that and these, all slow down responsiveness of the firefox and load memory as I use ssd and my cache space is 0.
-------------------------

Works well, just setting up a new PC and added this again. Combine it with Better Popup Blocker and you ready for anything. Better Popup Blocker isn't listed here any more, but get it from Softpedia and just drop the .crx file into chrome extensions.
-------------------------
chrome
A must. It completely works and I can't see using Chrome without it. Finally all of those annoying ads are gone!
-------------------------
chrome
I found this great extension called AdBlock Pure. It's actually based on the original and more popular AdBlock (which is way better than ABP), but it does not allow "non-intrusive ads." Non-intrusive ads is an oxy-moron! Ever since I found AdBlock Pure, I've been convinced it is the best ad blocker available. It's the next big Chrome extension.
-------------------------
chrome
Still the best ad-blocking extension for Chrome!
-------------------------
chrome
I have used this for the longest time, works great and troubleshooting support is good.

If Adblock Plus is not blocking ads on Chrome please click on the Support tab of the addon window and click the "support site" link.
-------------------------
chrome
For those of you still having problems with youtube ads, try this. Go into your Chrome apps page; chrome://apps/ and delete the youtube app from that page. 

It worked for me.

I know lots of people have posted this, but they getting getting buried by comments. So have another one.

Here's is an easy workaround for Chrome and Youtube using Adblock Plus
Simply remove youtube app...
to see the apps copy and paste: chrome://apps/ into a new browser right click said app and remove.
Hope that helps :)
-------------------------
chrome
Before I said there was a problem with this ad blocker. But someone I think in the reviews or support section mentioned that in order to clear that up one needs to uninstall Google Chrome and then it should work well. Of course, I went a step further and uninstalled the application then reinstalled it. Now it works. So for anyone having the problem, just do that and it works like a charm.

This is a must-have for any Chrome user. Adblock plus get rid of ALL annoying pop-ups, new windows, and the many other annoyances that have become part and parcel of browsing today. I can finally browse in peace. :)

It's a great tool. Easy to turn off, easy to customize what should get blocked. Simple interface, although the pseudo-regex (using wildcards) pattern you need to use to add to the blocked list is a little tricky... still, it never crashes and doesn't slow down Chrome!

The only downside that I can see is that my employer uses a tracking program and it locks up all Chrome Windows (waiting for AdBlockerPlus...) if I have too many tabs open--like 3! This is a glitch. Otherwise, its a GREAT program and I recommend it still. When it locks, I remove and re-install it, which has worked so far. Plus FREE is always a good price for me!

Honestly been using this extension for years on Firefox and now Chrome,just simply the most superb adblocker I have ever used!!!

Best Adblock for IE, Firefox and Chrome.

This thing is essential for Chrome or web browsing in general. Thanks. :)

One of the best extension for google chrome

Great! I have Win 7 installed on my mac, and I use adblock plus on both chromes!
-------------------------
chrome
Works better than expected! Mainly want to say Thank You Very Much Micheal & Katie, for allowing me to use your program for free. Recently became disabled and unable to work so every penny counts and because of you I can use the Interwebs via Chrome without ad bombardment or fewer pennies than before.

There is no add in my Chrome like it good luck guys

chrome
OMG......

I was fed up of all the rubbish ads on my chrome bt now its all smooth... after installing this all the ads juust vanished off.this is the best way to get rid of ads. (only for chrome)
-------------------------
browser
It does an okay job on web pages.  It would be better if it also blocked adware extensions from being installed on the Chrome browser without permission.
-------------------------
browser
with so many different adds it would constantly make my browser reload.  I have tried so many different things.  So grateful one click and that is no longer an issue.  I love this App
-------------------------

AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!everyday i would open chrome and like there were 20 ads on the page adblock pus is a lifesaver

Excellent extension.. Works perfectly with both chrome and firefox!!!

Best Extension to Block Add in Google Chrome
-------------------------
browser
This blocks all ads and doesn't slow down your browser at all!
-------------------------
browser
great resource. my son adds it to my web browsers to keep spam adverts off my system and he even adds custom lists, for my personal prefs and it doesn't bog down my system!

GREAT EVEN FOR OLD LADIES! tested on an ASUS running Win 8.1 64-bit -touchscreen

5 STARS [smooth as silk now], and now that FanBoy's list has been added to EasyList it's 10 Stars!

note: supports international lists, so you can get comprehensive ad blocking coverage, in any region and if malwared? install the south pacific lists; especially CHINA!*

*they are why we need ad block by default and a script blocker/flash blocker. waiting on NoScript for Chrome! :D

SEE?! EVEN OLD LADIES CAN USE/INSTALL THIS! ;)
-------------------------
chrome
really helpful.. thanks adblock and google chrome team !
-------------------------
browser
Now I can get rid off annoying and explicit ads on my browsers.

This app is great!
-------------------------
browser
Fantastic. I almost forgot the way i used to browse the net but this extension made my browser clean and free from annoying ads.
Thanks Adblock Plus...
-------------------------
browser
So far I like the control options listed. This is a lot to offer from an app that is integrated into a web browser for free. From what I can so far see and have experienced the advertisements are being kept to a "controlled low". Best app, download this one.
-------------------------
browser
Must have for every browser user. Excellent features for blocking unwanted adds on pages.
-------------------------
browser
Hey no more ads, just like it said would happem. Already one step ahead oh browser plug-ins and mobile apps.
-------------------------
browser
This works great! 
Thanks to the developer for a great extension. 

Request: This extension is resource hungry, it makes the chrome browser consumes 400 MB of Memory and more. To me this looks like a memory leak. I have tested this on multiple machines and the behavior is same. Please have a look into this one.
-------------------------
chrome
Very good! It works on older versions of Chrome but it doesn't block text-based advertisements.
-------------------------
browser
for the longest time I couldn't figure out why my browser was getting sluggish while trying to watch videos online, as it turns out it was all these bloody adds taking up band width and getting in the way Well I cant thank you enough for this app and just would like to say Wayda GO! Keep up the great work and stay ahead of these dingbats who are being hogs. Its bad enough to have ads on TV but the internet!? come on!!! So far what Ive seen is that my browsers have returned to normal and load time is fast and zippy again thanks to this app. Its worth a payment of support
-------------------------
chrome
This was working really well up until yesterday with the new Chrome update. Now the ads are playing again on Youtube.
-------------------------
chrome
Flawless extension on chrome..
-------------------------
chrome
works well but only 3>4 star only as new update not As effective had to uninstall chrome to reactivate adbplus
-------------------------
browser
It's great, but needs work. It blocks around 85% of all ads, while you still need to download other extensions to get the rest. 

Definitely a MUST HAVE extension for every browser.
-------------------------
chrome
Added to FIREFOX and now CHROME. Fantastic product. I am on the internet a lot. Just found out about this and my browsing is so much faster. No stops to load scripts from ads. Really good for this day and age with ads almost chasing you down. 5 Big Stars!!!
-------------------------
chrome
Will not block banner ads in Chrome. Works just fine with Facebook. Hint!
-------------------------
browser
Great app very helpful speeds up your browser.
-------------------------
chrome
The best ad protection available from chrome. I don't even remember what an ad looks like anymore.
-------------------------
chrome
One of the most essential apps for chrome. I cant live without it.
-------------------------
browser
+5star. Works wonderfuly. 

Please note: Anyone having trouble with adblock no longer blocking ads, close all tabs/wepbages, remove it and re-add. Works for me all the time (May require you to restart your browser)
-------------------------
chrome
Thank You! Great extension to Chrome!
-------------------------
chrome
Would be five stars but the chrome version is sometimes kind of buggy.   Not as user friendly as the firefox version of same. 
Still, really really really good.  A necessity as far as I'm concerned.
-------------------------
browser
The tool that makes you realize how annoying the Internet really is (if you ever have to use a browser without Adblock Plus!)

Best add on for chrome you can get!
-------------------------
chrome
Used this Extension for over 2 years and NEVER had an issue aside from me rolling back my PC yesterday and came to find for some reason i had to reinstall ABP along with Chrome itself due to an error; when i went to open chrome ABP was still installed but the statistics didnt show anything in the little icon window and it wasn't blocking any ads even when enabled on the current page. Still ★★★★★ definitely.
-------------------------
chrome
Excellent extension for blocking ads in Chrome!
-------------------------
chrome
new install of chrome, amazing how many ads there are. installed adblock and voila- no ads. just an essential app.
-------------------------

OK FIRST THIS APP IS AWESOME.!!!! ALL THE STUPID ADS THAT IS NOW ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB IS JUST TOO MUCH AND OFCOURSE SO ANNOYING.AND EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU DON'T NEED THIS APP, TRUST ME YOUR BROWSER WILL.

It is very useful. Before install this, I was faced a lot of problem in using of Chrome. Where ever i click on browser one add opens up. now I feel really happy. Thanks for this plugin. still some more plugins are adding without my notice to the browser. If that one also can be removed, feel very happy.

Awesome! It works great!
I had it in Firefox and it worked OK, but then I noticed it here and got it! Thank you Adblock Plus for blocking annoying/inappropriate ads!
-------------------------
chrome
nice extension must have it inbuilt in chrome....
-------------------------
chrome
It's brilliant. Really. It's literally my favourite  chrome add on.
-------------------------
chrome
I have found it the best tool to deny annoying ads on most every website I view. It sometimes blocks up to 600 plus on my Yahoo mail account in any given time frame. Just make sure that you delete it from Google Chrome if your computer needs to reboot due to new auto updates to your computer. I have found this wonderful tool likes to be informed that there was a system update. How do you know it's not working? If you don't see a single ad block at Yahoo Mail or some other site where there have been plenty of ads blocked in the past, delete the extension and reinstall it after a reboot. It's GREAT!
-------------------------
chrome
Works great, waiting for an update to work with 64bit Chrome.
-------------------------

just added to my chrome.. !!will let you know it is helpfull or not? and consumes what amount of cpu

-------------------------
chrome
Great app. I have used this on ForeFox and now Chrome.

Don't surf without it!!
-------------------------
chrome
does what it says it does. Blocks ads and allows me to manually block ads best plugin on chrome store imo.
-------------------------
chrome
I haven't seen a single YouTube add since I installed this extension into Chrome!! I love it and I would recommend it to anyone looking to ditch those crappy video adds between almost every  YouTube video you watch.
-------------------------
chrome
Ads immediately diminished by 90% and pages load faster.  It's the best extension I've added to Chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
I really enjoy using this app on Chrome :)
-------------------------
chrome
I enjoy this extension very much because it works wonders.
Now, for people who have trouble blocking ALL ADS: listen: you must
1)go to chrome settings, then extensions
2)click on OPTIONS on the  extension Adblock plus
3) UNCHECK the box that says "allow some non-intrusive advertisements"

hope that helps!
-------------------------
chrome
This was working when I installed it about a week ago, but it doesn't block anything or detect anything when Chrome is in Windows 8 mode. Works fine on desktop mode though.
-------------------------
chrome
Been using it for years. Worked great for me on Firefox and now on Chrome. I uninstalled Firefox after they forced their CEO to resign.

Adblock Plus is still the same great extension on Chrome.
-------------------------
browser
Still getting experience with this in chrome, liked it a lot in another browser
-------------------------
browser
Works wonders!  It blocks all of the annoying ads and discretely hides them away.  Webpages are presented as they should be sans the advertising.  It occurred to me how well this extension works when I used a friends' computer which was not running Adblock Plus.  I couldn't believe how many ads this extension blocks!  However, this extension is not perfect.  The only drawback I have found is that it will incorrectly block the basic functionality of certain websites.  This can be easily fixed by adding the site to your "Whitelist".  I gave it five stars because this is one of the essential extensions you should use! I have used this on Opera and Firefox as well.  Works just as well on any browser.
-------------------------
browser
Cool thing to add in your browser :D
-------------------------
browser
Amazing App. I have used ABP (and its various forks across browsers) for years. Recently it seems to not be working as well. Not sure if this is due to websites being extra diligent in bypassing ABP or what, but it has really made me realize how amazing this is when it works! Keep up the development :).
-------------------------
browser
Everyone must have this on their browser. It's incredible. You have to have it.
-------------------------
chrome
really really useful for chrome on mac
-------------------------
chrome
Amazing! Best thing I've ever used on Chrome
-------------------------
chrome
It used to perform better, but now it blocks   only part of the ads.
There are better adblock apps for Chrome - I compared it in the same session to adblock 2.6.18 and the later was much more efficient in blocking ads and jumping windows.
-------------------------
firefox
Great extension and have been using for the past 5 years on firefox
-------------------------
chrome
my gf bought a new computer and i downloaded google chrome and the first extension i got her was ADP,GREATTTT for youtube!
-------------------------
chrome
works perfectly on windows 7 chrome.  should you find it allowing adds through, check your subscriptions and computer update history.  i had audio drivers that were overriding my adblock.  one quick rollback and it worked perfectly again.
-------------------------
browser
If you are getting adds in youtube when this is enabled you need to disable the other version of flash in your browser. Do a simple google search to find out how..  Works great!!
-------------------------

Recomended Extention for Chrome

chrome
Can't use Chrome without it now! No YouTube video ads = AMAZING.
-------------------------

Holy black. i cannot express how much i LOVE this thing. it is the best most valuable thing you can get off the entire internet. if i could hug and kiss this app i totally would. if you could only download one app off chrome GET THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!! Only one problem... you will NEVER delete it!!!!!!!!

its very usefull thing for browser.

Best App you can get for Chrome.

i love it since firefox, when i was not using chrome.same experience great application
-------------------------
chrome
One day without Adsblock, I'm overwhelmed with all the spams !!! Google should integrate this extension into Chrome and adjust their ads accordingly haha !
-------------------------
chrome
Adblock Plus is my favorite extension by far. I love knowing too that I'm using open source software, which is working on a larger scale to make the internet better for users.

For all those wondering, this extension is better than the Chrome extension simply called "Adblock." This one offers some additional flexibility and features, has a cleaner interface, and is the fruit of the original advertisement blocking project (plus it's open source!). "Adblock" on the other hand, is someone trying to take advantage of this project by ripping the open source code, and then begging for donations.
-------------------------
chrome
This is an awesome app... works just as advertised. Best extension i ever installed for Chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
Works great! For those of you having problems, and ads still coming up, remove adblock from chrome and then reinstall. This will update the extension, and fix your problem!
-------------------------
chrome
755,254 Ads blocked by this Noble Prize worthy piece of software. This lifesaver has saved my visual cortex from having to process a gazillion gigabytes of advertisements. I'm in the developers of this software debt. For the newbs, you have to select and download a filter list. I use Easy and Adblock custom. In addition if you view the "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" list, select, copy, and paste it in to "Add your own filters" Chrome will be hitting 88 mph and you'll be seeing some plutonium speeds!
-------------------------
chrome
Best extension for Chrome!
-------------------------
browser
While it's great and a major convenience, a lot of pop-ups (New windows, banner ads) are making their way through.  Other than that it works, and best of all, it's FREE. Highly recommend everyone takes the 30 seconds to download it on their browser.
-------------------------
chrome
Works well, but it seems slow and Chrome keeps hanging up on "Waiting for extension Adblock Plus."  Would also be nice to see a list of what ads were blocked instead of just a count.
-------------------------
chrome
ABP is simply awesome! I hope you can update it for Chrome 32 ASAP. Thank you for the awesomeness.
-------------------------
chrome
Been helpful since my Chrome stalled:)
-------------------------

Really helps with browser security. Blocks all other popups that google misses
-------------------------

Using it here and in Firefox.  Great!

This program is very effective and I see that I was not the only one who didn't know about the Youtube adds , This program will never be removed from my chrome !

The MOST useful exentsion for chrome.

One of the most useful extensions on any web browser.
-------------------------

Love this! Used it on Firefox and glad to see it on Chrome.
-------------------------
browser
I often forget how cluttered a browser without Adblock Plus can look. Great app, removes all visual noise from attention grabbing ads.
-------------------------
chrome
The previous revisions were FANTASTIC. Chrome updated. No longer works at all. Popups, ads, embedded video commercials. All the joys of the internet are back. Woot.
-------------------------
browser
awesome, browser spd also faster than ever.
-------------------------
chrome
It was working until the new Chrome 31 Update. Now it just works randomly. I would appreciate an updated version.
-------------------------
chrome
Probably the best extension Ive  ever installed on chrome
-------------------------
browser
BEST BROWSER EXTENSION EVER. I possibly can't imagine browsing without this tool. A definitely must-have extension
-------------------------
chrome
This is by far the best one on the market. It kills even the annoying video ads. I actually still like written ads. Must have for Chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
To get it to work again, all I had to do was remove it from chrome and re-install it. I assumed there was an update or something.
Great as usual, Adblock Plus!
-------------------------
chrome
I browsed internet without this app a while ago and it still gives me nightmares.

Best app for Chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
Fantastic. Best Chrome extension you can D/L. :)
-------------------------
chrome
HERE'S HOW TO ENABLE IT: 1. Go to Chrome's "Settings"
2. Go to "Extensions"
3. Next to Adblock Plus, click the "Options" link.
4. On the "Filter lists" page, click "+ Add Filter Subscription"
5. Choose one, like "EasyList (English)"
6. Click "+ Add" button.
7. After it's added, close Google Chrome.
8. YOU NOW HAVE ADBLOCK PLUS WORKING!!! You need to be subscribed to one of these filter subscriptions so ABP knows what is an Ad, and what isn't, in order to work! Simple! :) You're Welcome!
-------------------------
chrome
BEST APP EVER FOR CHROME

firefox
Works better when using Firefox, still seeing cr*p in FB that I don't see when running FireFox (14.0.2)
-------------------------
chrome
Very awesome Ad Blocker, works perfectly each time although I have to say when I update Google Chrome I have to re-install it for it to work  which is no problem and takes a few seconds this is by far the best extension I have gotten form the chrome store thanks!
-------------------------
chrome
Hasn't been working the past 2 days on Chrome. I am receiving pop ups and advertisements all over. I've been using this for years, and this is the first time it hasn't worked. Will rate 5 stars once this is fixed.
-------------------------
chrome
Superb App From Google. Now I Can Ignore all the Goofy Stuff in Youtube & Chrome. :D
-------------------------
chrome
NO MORE ANNOYING ADS due to this add-on I got a few hours after I first got my hands on google chrome since 2010. I can enjoy and be safer on my web surfing experience at the same time. No more adware and No more super frustrating vibrant ads disguised as double underlined words.
-------------------------
chrome
Amazing App that I have been using since the days of Mozilla Firefox 2,0 and Google Chrome Beta! Works great, and definitely keeps away all of those pesky ads and pop-ups! A must have on every device!
-------------------------
browser
I have never had any problem with this addon whatsoever.  It's always worked exactly as promised, across a variety of different web browsers, and made my web browsing experience a whole lot more pleasant.  On lower-end machines, it does slow things down ever-so-slightly while loading, but aside from that, this is an absolute must have for both casual web surfers and people looking through specific sites.
-------------------------
browser
Very good But it makes page loading & browser speed low.
-------------------------
browser
The MUST extension !!!!
We will never say it enough times.

It saves your brain attention to serve you to focus on just the worth from the web that you are looking for.

It should be embedded by default in any browsers.

(Why is it still in Beta?)
-------------------------
chrome
Use this everywhere on any computer with Chrome
-------------------------
browser
A must have for everyone for every browser you use, simple, comfortable, useful. I had in which ever browser I use.
-------------------------
firefox
Elements option is the best thing available.

Update is also great.... Better than the Firefox one at least... ...
-------------------------
chrome
essential! my biggest  quibble is that it doesn't work as well in chrome compared to firefox. regardless, it works, and the few ads that squeak by are easily dealt with.

Works seamlessly in my browser, speeds up my searches and declutters my webpages from the annoying aggravating ads. I have recently reinstalled after changing my hard drive - and software. As a user of at least three years I have never been let down by Adblock plus.

Dear all, 

My name is Job Plas, and I am the Project Manager for Adblock Plus. Due to a bug, YouTube video ads have been showing for everyone using an adblocker (not only Adblock Plus).

We're happy to announce that we fixed this, and that Adblock Plus is now the only Chrome extension which blocks all annoying YouTube video ads again!

Happy browsing from the ABP team :) 

Best, 
Job

Best software for chrome...!!!

Love this extension! The first thing I add to Chrome when I install it (although, now that Google automatically downloads extensions on new instances of the browser, I don't need to add it manually)
-------------------------
chrome
shoud be integrated in chrome
-------------------------

This extension is a very great advertisement blocker. Probably the best! It simply just stops those aggravating pop-ups and screen ads making browser the web safer and a lot less of a hassle now I'm not accidentally clicked on fake 'Download now' signs.

THE BEST PLUGIN FOR ANY BROWSER EVER .. SAVED MANY HOURS

5 star extension now! It works well and I can add my own custom filters/create my own personalized list, if EasyList + Annoyances + Privacy + Fanboy's ULTIMATE & COMPLETE aren't good enough! *scoffs* LOVED IT FOR FIREFOX AND LOVING IT FOR CHROME and better than IE9/ie10's current versions (a bit buggy-ie10), but haven't had any issues, with this extension acting up, or crashing. SO FAR SO GOOD! A SPECIAL THANKS TO THE DEV! YOU ROCK! THANKS! ~S~
-------------------------
chrome
Best of the best. Should come auto with chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
I love that you can remove any form of ad yourself if it is not blocked already
it makes google chrome a lot more enjoyable, thank you Ad Block Plus!
-------------------------
chrome
It stops working overtime or if Google chrome crashes or if the extension it self crashes it stops working but it works great this is my 3rd time reinstalling it.
-------------------------
chrome
Those ads are gone! I had to uninstall and re-install my Google Chrome recently and let me tell you...this thing makes browsing the internet so much more enjoyable! Thank you!
-------------------------
chrome
This is an amazing app/extension. I love Adblock Plus it truly removes all ads from any webpage even youtube video ads. Its worth downloading but the only con is it does increase Chrome memory usage which is to be expected but pros out way the cons.
-------------------------
browser
This extension comes with a HD something extension that puts publicity and promotions on your browser. Be careful
-------------------------
browser
nice,this what i looking for for my browser
-------------------------
browser
Does exactly what I need, blocks ads. Simple and doesn't slow down my browser. Highly recommend.
-------------------------
chrome
I love AdBlock Plus! I had it on Firefox and it was great at keeping 95% of the pop-ups at bay, and 100% keeping stupid sidebar ads on facebook and yahoo away. I was hoping they made an extension for chrome when I made the switch, imagine my delight! :) I fully endorse AdBlock Plus!

*UPDATE* I still love ABP, but on facebook, it only intermittently blocks the sponsored ads :/ Hopefully, they find a permanent fix to this.
-------------------------
browser
Works great! My browser is %95 add free, and I am %95 percent less annoyed.
-------------------------
browser
This is the best add-on ever that I must install on any browser be it Firefox or Chrome! I hate ads and this free little add-on makes them disappear forever!
-------------------------
browser
It's a must for all current generation browsers.
-------------------------
chrome
One of the first extensions I install on any new chrome install. Just working...
-------------------------
chrome
I use it with ghostery on every website which  do't offer premium accounts with no ads.
It's a must have ! If you must have only one extension for Chrome it is the one !
-------------------------

never had a problem with this extehsion in firefox. and never had one with chrome extehsion its a great plugin.

wow... a little TOO clean of a browser I have !

Works perfect. Light on system, and doesn't slow down the browser. It actually speeds it up.

Really helpfull to keep my browsers 'clean' :))
-------------------------
chrome
I have noticed that it does indeed block all ads.  I have never had any ads on any computer I use Google Chrome on.  I say this is the best Ad-blocker because it does not slow the computer unlike some others.
-------------------------
chrome
same  adblock plus  for chrome it is for  chome  as it is  for  firefox
-------------------------
browser
This extension does block  most ads but does not block all adds in YouTube which is not that great.
Overall, a great addition  to your browser.
-------------------------
browser
There's really no reason not to have this plugin. Simple, elegant, and to the point. No more ads. Bandwidth is happy. Browser is happy. I'm happy And annoyed that so many ppl copy and pasted this in the ratings

By far, the bast ad blocking plugin you can have on your Chrome browser. Period.

Love it, love it, love it.  Absolutely one of the first plug-ins I get every time I need to get a new browser (new computer, or reformat & reinstall, or whatever).  One of the very first.  I don't understand why it doesn't come with every browser, except then, hum, what would all the advertisers do?  LOL
-------------------------
browser
It's simply a must have. It is probably my favorite extension in fact.I love it so much that it actually makes me angry when I'm using other computers and see all the ads that I've been missing since I put Adblock Plus in my browser. If you don't use Adblock then may God have mercy on your soul.
-------------------------
chrome
It's great, but on some sites it doesn't remove the ads completely. I see a "Chrome cannot display this webpage" thing in place of where the ad usuall is, then it disappears.

Still, great job guys!

Fantastic Program! A must have for any browser!

-------------------------
chrome
the best extension in Chrome

No ads even on Pandora... great blocker and runs well with Chrome. =)
-------------------------
browser
The best ad blocking solution for Chrome and Firefox. The other popular ad block extension hijacks your browser home page, and each time re-directs to their home page asking for donation.
-------------------------
chrome
it's ok if you use youtube for videos, but other video sites won't let you watch stuff without ads because that's how they make money.it is helpful but i rather watch anything i want without having to delete from chrome.

This plugin is always on my browser. It help me a lot because I'm living in a very remote area which internet connection is very slow. Its "FREE" so it really helps me as a student who don't have job. Thanks a lot Adblock plus!

It was a perfect adblock extension until Google Chrome version 26.0.1410.63 arrived.
-------------------------
chrome
Recently added this to Chrome and it's performing perfectly so far.  Don't know why I waited so long to add this.

Does a GREAT job of suppressing ads which means a big improvement in my (slow DSL) online experience.

Don't forget to make a small donation to Adblock Plus if you can.

Best Chrome extensions, I  LOVE It

One of the best Firefox extensions comes to Chrome. Without a doubt, this is one of the best ad blockers on the net, allowing you to browse faster because the ads don't get downloaded while you browThere's really no reason not to have this plugin.

Superb addon. I am using it with Firefox for last few years. Always promising. Now working superb with Chrome too. Many Thanks to the developer. Keep it up!!!

This extension has been a constant imperative addon since I have been using Firefox, and now with Chrome. 

By far one of the adblockers out there. 5 stars. Thanks!

great to use on firefox, glad it was added on chrome

A must for Chrome.

This is the best addon I've used till date on all my PCs. For firefox and Chrome.Would love to have one for IE too.
-------------------------
chrome
If it wasn't for this specific extension, I wouldn't be using Chrome. The copycats I now see listed here don't come close.

While Firefox has better methods of making things like this work, this does as good a job as anything can for Chrome right now. Thanks for the great work!
-------------------------
browser
Now more than ever, this is an essential extension for any Web browser.  I'm sure it could be better, but for the basic user it's flawless.
-------------------------
chrome
This is one of my essential plugins I always install with Firefox. It makes me very happy that it is available for Chrome too.

Clearly this makes FF & Chrome so much more secure than IE. Die IE die.

Absolutely immense extension. Highly Recommended to every single Google Chrome user, out there!!
-------------------------

This is absolutely the best extension/app to use while browsing. Works flawlessly. If Google removes this from Chrome like they did from the Android, I will switch back to Firefox.
-------------------------
chrome
This is such a great extension to Chrome. No more ads... EVAR! :)
-------------------------
chrome
When I bought a new laptop first thing I did was installed chrome, and second thing I did was download this plugin, just to show how big of a priority it actually is.
-------------------------
chrome
This extension has been working perfectly for me. I especially enjoy the easy to use "easy create filter."

This is my favorite adblocker and I've tried a lot for Chrome that is currently available. 5 Stars! Thanks!!!

chrome
Finally this is free! I've been using Firefox for the longest time just because you had to pay for this (or chromes equivalent). Back to chrome
-------------------------
firefox
It worked well on Firefox and works just as well here. Love it!
-------------------------
chrome
So much better than it is on Firefox. Blocks Youtube ads! (or maybe Chrome does that?)
-------------------------
chrome
Used the "Adblock" plugin for Chrome before switching to "Adblock Plus". So far it's been faster than Adblock and it doesn't break some sites that Adblock did. Overall, great plugin.
-------------------------
chrome
I love this extension! It's awesome. Best thing I've ever downloaded from the Chrome Web Store.
-------------------------
chrome
Love this extension. Whenever I get a new computer, I download Google Chrome and then immediately download ABP because it makes everything faster! Thanks ABP!!! Please never remove this!
-------------------------
chrome
This is a great extension for Chrome and a great Add-On to Firefox, but for some reason Reddit ads still show up. (Few of them thanked me for not using ABP even when I had it activated)

Works just like the Firefox version, which is why I use Firefox, now I can use Chrome.

Best add on for chrome! Keep up the good work!

Great extension - Does what it says. Chrome version is a little off, but I can't complain too much. YouTube browsing is 100% more enjoyable.
-------------------------
chrome
I've been using this for a very long time. Was the best Chrome or Firefox add-on ever. Since the recent update, I see ad's everywhere. Please fix it!
-------------------------
chrome
If you download this for the sole purpose it removes Pandora ads, it's worth your time.  I was on ESPN's website looking at Xgames crashes and forced to watch the same stupid 30sec clip before every video when I started looking for a way to stop it.  This works and is probably my favorite Chrome ad on.
-------------------------
chrome
one of the greats add-on for chrome!!! :)

Been using this for a good couple of years; definitely the best AdBlock out there for Chrome-Based Browsers.

(Currently using: Comodo Dragon)

Great tool that improves browsing the web immensely.

Is funny how even though it has 7.7m+ users it doesn't feature on the Popular section of the chrome web store... :)
-------------------------

It works very well.

Does anyone else notice the initial loading of it when opening a new chrome browser, it takes forever for adblock to load.

chrome browser status bar just hangs for a couple minutes saying loading adblock...

works perfect after it loads though

Best pop-up blocker out there!!! Must have for any browser

not as good as the firefox version, but works for some sites.

Adblock Plus is a fantastic tool and add-on for Firefox, it allows you to block internet ads, block un-wanted images, which generally speeds up loading time on websites. 
It's easy to configure and has a set list of known ad suppliers to block so you don't have to input anything.
-------------------------
chrome
it solves my problems it very usefull to me. thank s to chrome.

Adblock Plus is excellent i have been looking for something like this for a long time. I am sick and tired of being hit with hundreds of annoying ads every day but now thanks to this zippy chrome add on my life is hassle free

Very happy with this and am sure they are smoothing out any wrinkles, the best I have used with Chrome for sure!
-------------------------
browser
I love it on every browser its the best add blocker from my point of view..

Google Chrome is THE best browser. Google, I am hypnotized by your products... They are simple, dependable, and most importantly, your products are mostly free while still offering a gigantic variety of products and services that people depend upon from day to day. I must admit, even my beloved phone is a Google Android... My iPhone was water damaged in a sea kayaking capsize (the dry-bag was not appropriately closed) and I have been much happier with my Droid! Adblock, you are delightful and you pair with Chrome to(somehow?) create an even smoother browsing experience. Well, it's obviously because of the blocked advertisements. I am devout to both Google and AdBlock. Yesterday I opened my Firefox browser for the first time since reformatting my laptop. It was messy, slow, spammy, something Chrome was not before installing these extensions and applications. After installing the same extensions in Firefox and testing it out for a night, I gave up and quickly ran back into the comforting arms of Google Chrome! Firefox was horrifying. I had to remove so many toolbars and search engines, specifically YAHOO!, that I never installed. No other person has the keys to my laptop either... I always specify "NO" when installing programs that ask. These toolbars were never present within my Chrome and it was my first time opening Firefox since its initial installation. Firefox was a boggy nightmare. Thank you, Google, for so many privileges. I do not take these for granted. Customer service is supreme from my experiences compared to other websites. Considering the overload Google has, it is astonishing to me. Google even pays me! How much more could I, or anyone for that matter, ask of Google?
-------------------------
chrome
While not quite as robust as NoScript in Firefox, AdBlock Plus adds major security (and removes annoyance) from Chrome. Removing adverts not only makes the page cleaner, but can also help prevent "drive-by" attacks from infected web sites. 

Please support the developers of this excellent and necessary tool!
-------------------------
firefox
very helpful, have used for a long time before on firefox, best addon on the web :)
-------------------------
browser
The best extensions are the ones you don't notice; this is one of them. Other than a nifty little icon for re-enabling ads (almost never needed), the only difference it will make: no more ads. It's that easy. The speed of the browser is not noticeably affected, and everything seems to be perfect - only ad-free.
-------------------------
chrome
Awesome app!! Definitely the best ad blocking app for chrome!
-------------------------
chrome
I love this app, it works , it prevents me from seeing all those annoying  advertisements. I have not encountered any problems with it so far. I use Adblock Plus in Chrome and Firefox.
-------------------------
browser
It's a must-have on Chrome or on any browser for that matter!
-------------------------
chrome
works in FireFox and Chrome. The best add-on ever
-------------------------
chrome
Gets everything and works wonderfully. As yet I have not seen an ad since I "added" to Chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
Gives you control to block/unblock anything, also if there are tiny adds getting through just un-tick the box saying: "Allow some non-intrusive advertising" And make sure you have both lists:
EasyList
And if you want/need (your personal choice):
Fanboy's Adblock List

You can do this by clicking "Add filter subscription" make sure you get the English ones though, or any other language you want/need.
Highly recommend this extension! Don't get the Chrome Adblock!!! They track you, this doesn't!
-------------------------
browser
While I loved Adblock Plus for Firefox, I don't like it for Chrome. I had to recently switch browsers and got Chrome versions of all my addons (or very similar in function equivalents), and I'm not impressed with how this one works. A lot of advertisement went through, if I right-click to block an ad, nothing happens, and nothing gets put into the custom filter. It was honestly a much more reliable addon for firefox and much simpler  there as well.

I switched to the other "Adblock" addon, and I have to say that it does the job I require and it is so much simpler to add custom filters, and it uses all the same filters (EasyList, Fanboy, etc) as this one!
-------------------------
chrome
One of the firs things I install when I load up Chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
this is one of the best ad blockers available for google chrome.
-------------------------
firefox
Been using it since Adblock Plus was available for Firefox. It's the best and will always be!
-------------------------
firefox
Love this extension. That is what sold me after I decided to drop the FireFox which also featured that same extension. There is nothing wrong with it and it does work. If you're aware of how to use the settings. You're all set.  5 stars, recommended!
-------------------------
chrome
This app is a big reason why I switched from Firefox to Chrome!
-------------------------
chrome
I have this for Chrome and Firefox on all my computers (never use IE). I love it! No more annoying ads!!!
-------------------------
chrome
Best ad blocker for chrome. Better than adblock. Adblock doesn't block all ads and also does emotional blackmails showing the donate banner. Adblock plus (this app) is far far better.
-------------------------
chrome
This is one of the most amazing apps for chrome.  I never have youtube ads or ads anywhere else, I don't know what I'd do without my Adblock.
-------------------------
chrome
Best free ad blocker available. Does slow down the page but only ever slow slighty, others freeze the page for a up to 5-10 seconds, the ones that don't, don't block the ad. The updates aren't obtrusive either like some other chrome apps. 9.5/10 from me.
-------------------------
browser
Love this app. Use it on all my browsers!
-------------------------
chrome
Works quickly and efficiently. But no longer blocks audio ads on Pandora (though I can skip them atleast) and now I see some side ads on Facebook, including recommended pages. This was not so before. Either those sites adapted or Chrome update changed the effectiveness of ADP Beta. Good overall. though.
-------------------------
chrome
This is like the best chrome extension ever created. //awesomeness
-------------------------
chrome
If this extension can stop the pop-ups, it would be the best Google Chrome extension.
It's so good, no ads at all. The ads in my region are not in the list, but I can block them by myself (:

Awesome App. accelerate your browser and improve the UX.

The best adblock for Chrome
-------------------------
browser
It's perfect!
It's fast and easy to use, I strongly recommend it to everyone that gets annoyed of adds!
What makes it special is, as I said, that it's fast and easy to use. Unlike most adds blockers that slows the browser down and sometimes makes it crash.

The Best extension on Google Chrome & plugin on Firefox is * Adblock Plus *
-------------------------
chrome
great plugin for chrome

I love it. Not only does it block ads, it also has a feature that allows it to block unfiltered and annoying webpage elements. Everyone should have it on there Chrome.

The Best extension for chrome...

chrome
Been using ABP for years under FireFox. Glad to see it finally for Chrome. Works great, as always!
-------------------------
chrome
This is the real Adblock Plus for Chrome. Adblock is completely independent and while competent I personally find it never quite meets the complete standards of Adblock Plus. While not quite as powerful as it's Firefox older brother it gets the job done and also does a flawless job of blocking those annoying YouTube streaming ads. If the occasional text ad happens to slip through (never seen it myself. Have a heart and let them display. Sites need to make their revenue somehow and so long as the ads aren't intrusive (banner, video, flash animation etc) then there's nothing to really complain about.
-------------------------
chrome
Best add-on for chrome ^^
-------------------------
browser
For me this plugin is mandatory for a browser!
-------------------------
chrome
Best add blocker that I know of! I used to use it in Firefox and it worked great, now in chrome only a few things have changed; it's still the best one by far. Though it's not as good as the Firefox version, It still blocks all the adds on every website I've been on without blocking good content (it even works for GrooveShark!)
-------------------------
chrome
I love this extension ... the only thing I think that needs corrected is the fact that when you start Chrome and the previous session loads the extension doesn't block the adware before loading the pages.
-------------------------
chrome
Outstanding, this works great on firefox and chrome. Five stars.
-------------------------
firefox
This is an excellent product. I use it in Firefox as well.
-------------------------
browser
This is the MUST HAVE extension for any browser. I can't believe people surf the web without it.
-------------------------
chrome
This extension blocks almost every single ad that I see.  Best program ever for chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
I love this so much Especially on sites with adult related advertisements. Great for parents with kids. The "Beta" is better than the full version. I recommend this to all my fellow Chrome users.
-------------------------
firefox
The Firefox one was awesome, this is quite not there yet... Always ads coming through...
-------------------------
chrome
It is really amazing. I loved it. The extension is light (for both chrome and firefox) and yet powerful. 

But some facebook ads get through.. :(
-------------------------
chrome
There are VERY few sites where I have seen issues with this plugin, and when I do encounter an issue, I try to switch to a 2nd Google Chrome profile and reload the page.  Great plugin1
-------------------------
chrome
Love Adblock Plus on Firefox, love it on Chrome. Easy to set up, powerful filters, what more could you ask for?
-------------------------
browser
Seems to work rather well on the RockMelt browser. Unsurprising , as it is written with Chrome code. Had a few issues where ads stopped being blocked, but a re-installation and refresh worked fine. Really good app.
-------------------------
chrome
Best adblock in Town !! Removes every add visible and loads pages faster. If adds do pop up then just click the "Adblock Plus icon" in the omnibox and then click the "AD" on that page, the ad would no longer appear and it's url entry will be made in the filter list (For future reference).......  
Haven't been pestered by  many adds since I've started using this addon (Past 1 year, on firefox and chrome). Thanks and keep up the good work :)
-------------------------
chrome
Great add-on for chrome. Silently blocks advertising on a wide range of websites. Very effective!
-------------------------
chrome
pros: must have for all chrome, 
cons: there's no "disable for this website" feature, 
and it seems slow down my chrome a bit (but still better than the the other adblock extension). 
last update april? come on guys pay attention to this extension not just the firefox one!
-------------------------
chrome
I love this so much. It totally blocks the ads, I have forgotten that they were ever there! I really recommend this. One time, it did cause chrome to crash, though. Once.
-------------------------
firefox
This works great. even easier to use than the Firefox version. I love it!
-------------------------
chrome
Speaking as someone who uses both regularly for nearly the same functions, I agree with a previous reviewer - for some reason, Adblock Plus is WAY more effective at blocking ads in Chrome than Firefox. Even video ads on sites like YouTube, DailyMotion, etc get blocked, in addition to the regular annoying pop-ups/sidebar ads/etc. Highly recommend it!
-------------------------
chrome
This is the ad blocking extension you want.

Adblock Plus (Beta) for Chrome is not as powerful as its Firefox companion, but it is continuously improving. At first release, video ad blocking was spotty but it is now nearly on par with its Firefox companion. Video ad blocking works far better compared to the other popular Adblock extension in the Chrome Web Store. 

Banner ads and in-line text ads blocking work very well. I do allow ads from some of my favorite sites where the ad placements aren't overwhelming understanding that is how they raise revenue.
-------------------------
chrome
It is working fine even for Google Chrome for Ubuntu Linux. It provides power saving against power consumption monsters flash  banners.
-------------------------
chrome
I am SO pleased to see AdBlock Plus on Chrome!  I have missed it tremendously!  They've been around for ages, and I'm glad to see it still being developed.  Thanks for streamlining and simplifying our browsing experience.
-------------------------
chrome
Hands down the best extension for Chrome!

A must have!
-------------------------
chrome
My review being I've had a lot of problems with ads I thought it might be a virus because they were popping up in my FB messages and blocking all side videos related to a video i may have been watching on youtube (BTW I use Chrome) so I just got this and it worked wonders now there are no ads my videos are not lagging by them no ads in my messages it was fantastic And my side videos are now there again..there is sometime a blank box where an ad should be but i think that  may be the virus i may have even so nothings in the box everything else is fantastic Thank you for this so much!
-------------------------
chrome
works great on Firefox, but it doesn't seem to work for me on chrome but still it works amazingly on firefox so 3/5
-------------------------
firefox
Would love if it had firefox style flash blockers.
-------------------------
chrome
100% CPU usage during google chrome startup
-------------------------
chrome
Thank you for this extension. I have been using ABP since back in Firefox years ago. I compared AdBlock on Chrome and ABPlus on Chrome to see which one uses less memory and ABPlus uses almost 20mb less memory to run than AdBlock. :D
-------------------------
chrome
Thanks for the porting from Firefox to Chrome, which I prefer to use when watching videos on trusted websites. For the rest I use Firefox, Adblock Plus and NoScript.
-------------------------
chrome
Silently removes ads. This is a really good extension. I haven't had any problems and don't even notice that it or the ads are there. I would recommend this for any chrome users. It's really good stuff. Thanks guys, you make browsing a joy!
-------------------------
chrome
Glad to see Adblock Plus  on Chrome. Now im waiting for Adblock Plus Pop-up Addon to be added. When this happens i can finally switch from Firefox to Chrome. Chrome is much better then Firefox, but i use Firefox only for this amazing add-ons.
Adblock Plus and Adblock Plus Pop-up are the best add-ons out there.
-------------------------
chrome
Works great, I installed the same day I got Chrome... I now I don't even remember that those annoying ads exist... You should have this!
-------------------------
firefox
Working much like the one I use and love in Firefox!
-------------------------
chrome
Nice and easy to use.
Thanks to that surfing on the web is way more how it supposed to be!

-1 star because:
Unfortunately there is no such thing as preference-sync via Chrome. It would be the best extension i've ever used it the manual grown blocking-list would be synced.

Thanks guys!
-------------------------
chrome
I've used Adblock Plus for years and years with Firefox, and never saw a single ad. Used it with Chrome for a few hours, and I've seen dozens -- Suspiciously, only ones on Google pages... I've managed to get rid of the most persistent ones with the Adblock Element Helper and some additional addons, but it's disappointing to see that something I loved and trusted appears to have sold out. Overall still the best ad blocker out there, though.
-------------------------
firefox
its good, just wish filters auto updated like they do in firefox.
-------------------------
chrome
Wish I had thought to look for this sooner! I have it on Firefox, and I love it. Don't know what prompted me to look for it on Chrome today, but I'm glad I did.
-------------------------
firefox
While it dosent always work like the firefox one, it is way better than adblock.
-------------------------
chrome
Far worse than any firefox ad blocking plugin, but far better than any plugin on chrome.
-------------------------
browser
Fantastic addition.  I've had no problems whatsoever with Adblock Plus.  It now hurts my eyes to browse the web on other computers/browsers who do not have this add on.  

It is also VERY easy to block customer adds/images in the (rare) case of ABP not catching certain adds.

This should really come standard with all browsers.
-------------------------
chrome
Works great, no problems here, unlike the other AdBlock that broke Chrome on my PC. Wouldn't touch the other if you paid me.
-------------------------
browser
For a BETA extension; this is by far the best for ad-blocking.  Reviewers complaining about the product in a review need to contact the developer to try to resolve these BETA issues.  Love it.  Use it.  Mandatory in my Chrome web browser.
-------------------------
firefox
Epic like Firefox version.
-------------------------
chrome
I liked using this extension while actively using firefox. I'm almost positive I'll have the same likeness with the functionality in Google Chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
This is one of my favourite extensions in the Google Chrome store.

It works like a charm, especially after adding extra subscriptions.  

Website s are now a pleasure to read and I can actually follow the flow of the content. I especially like the complete absence of popups and other Flash nonsense.

The only feature I miss from the Firefox version is the "disable for this site" option on the button that automatically adds the current site to the whitelist.

All-in-all, I love the extension and keep up the good work!
-------------------------
firefox
Works okay but not as good as the one in Firefox.
-------------------------
chrome
Excellent extension, I add this on every machine I work on after I install  Firefox and Chrome. Works well for basic and advanced users. 

In fact most end users I'v e installed this for now take it for granted.  If I disable it or they use IE, the user says "where'd all the ads come from?".
-------------------------
firefox
As a user of firefox i love this. It's more faster than the others all feature is good.
-------------------------
firefox
should make it like the firefox version where you can block a frame or ad just by right clicking it
-------------------------
chrome
It's the best extension for Chrome ever!
-------------------------
browser
Essential plugin for any browser. Hard to browse without it.
-------------------------
chrome
Best ad-blocker for chrome or chromium right now, I use the experimental builds from their website for even better performance. 5/5, over 4x faster than just "Adblock"
-------------------------
chrome
I used Ad Block Plus with Firefox and I loved it.  This one works well but doesn't block all of the advertisements in video sites like South Park Studios and Hulu, for example.  It still works well, but that's one thing that the firefox version has over this one for Chrome.  If this could be fixed it would be fantastic and I'd give this app five stars.  Thank you!
-------------------------
chrome
I can't believe I've been using the old version and not Adblock Plus for all these years! Finally found this last night when setting up Chrome on my laptop, just got it running on my PC and everything loads super fast now!

data - 44

It is super 
it is survive my router data

It works the way it says, with a few slips up here and there.
But I do have a question for the developers. Do you guys collect password information?
If so I'm worried my data could get breached in a leak.

I have a couple of macbook pros.
i learned not to do updates for safari, because it removed my adblock plus and i could never use it again... i have mojave on one, am not going to update it, and adblock plus is like God to me, living for two years with ads on youtube, now ad free completely...
i find every couple of weeks youtube or google comes out with a new bypass probably a trojan on a video i watch, but i found a way to stop all ads...
all you do is open the adblock plus icon on top of your screen, on CHROME, which I am using, NOT safari, it wont work on safari anymore... but on Chrome, when you install adblock plus, you get a red icon on top of screen.

ABP has been great over the years and they are on my Xmas card list. They let you make the choices! I'm already sick of being told by a computer telling me what to do, based on their data mining, if it weren't for the content creators I'd go to Brave tomarrow! Old school ABP all the way.

Sadly my favorite News sites have so many ads on one page, that it sucks the cycle life out of my speedy computer.  Many of the ads are on slow servers, and the data being fetched takes forever to load.

Wow dude, your understand of the internet and how it works is atrocious.  
First of all, the internet is NOT free...we pay ISP's out the butt to access the internet and THAT should be considered our "membership" fee (if you will) when it comes to P2P...but, that's a whole 'nother ball of wax.
Secondly, the "internet" doesn't rely on ad's...the websites rely on ads.  And, truth be told, they don't rely on ads, they just take advantage of the opportunity to sell ad's if they're a popular site.  The more popular the site, the more ad's they sell.

Blocks ads for youtube and when watching tv shows on various websites. It is very nice. It does not stop your browsing data from being recorded. If you ask it too block them, it does some.

I have used this for two years at least.  Does what is says it will.  Development is consistent and frequent.  Occasionally there is a CPU hit, it gets resolved.  Very rarely there is an ad it does not catch, when reported and then blocked it usually solves this. Whitelisting sites or just pages is easy.  Thanks ABP!

it does what it says it will and it does it rather well in my opinion and at no cost to me so five star from me! 10/10 I definitely recommend though I will say while it does block ads some websites have software to see if you are using an adblocker and will stop you from using it till you deactivate the ad blocker not to criticize adblock it's free and does as promised.

Best app ever!  Ad free forever....over a decade ad free.  I started using ABP many years ago it's been so long I forget now.  Every time I'm over my parents or a friends house I look at their screens and I cannot believe all the junky flashy pop up ad's that get in their way.  They have lost complete control of how their electronic devices work.  The ad companies have taken over.  Every time I buy a new laptop or pc I download ABP immediately.  Just being without it for those few moments upon startig up a new machine I'm bombarded the second I go to any web site.  Nope not for me.  ABP has stopped all that non sense.  I'm in control of my computers.  No ad's.  No pop up's.    Very easy to use.  Seamless.  Just set it and forget it.  Download and you are all set.  Thank you ABP for all the wonderful years of your wonderful software.  I'm poor and disabled and cant donate a dime but if I was a rich girl you would get a nice donation.  I hope my review makes up for my lack of funds.

Works wonders for me, YouTube was the reason I decided to get this extension and it works as though YouTube doesn't have any ads. Another great thing I found while on the web was that the sites that usually have those pop-up ads and the ones that show up in the bottom right of the screen are gone. I've had this extension for about a year now and it works all the time and doesn't slow down my computer. I have an AMD ryzen 5 1400 and 16gb of 3200hz ram. Its better than some computers, however its not the best computer. Either way I know for a fact that most computers can run this extension because I had seen a lot of people complaining about that.

Wenn ich ehrlich bin weiß ich nicht was viele haben. Ich mag den Adblocker. Er macht was er soll. Nur leider habe ich mitbekommen dass er auf Twitch.TV und Spotify nicht funktioniert. Stört mich nicht weiter weil ich Spotify Premium hab und bei Twitch ist es nur eine Werbung am Anfang eines Live Streams. Das es Chrome verlangsamen soll oder sehr viel CPU Leistung zieht kann ich auch nicht bestätigen. 5 Sterne auf jeden Fall wert.

Excellent. Works very well. Uses rather a lot of memory, but every time I have to turn it off (because a website forces me to) I hear the CPU fan spin up because of all the extra flashing ads it's loading. Would love if you guys can make it harder for websites to force us to take it off.

Adblock Plus has been a lifesaver for me.  We live in a rural community and our only internet is our cell phone hotspot.

I have been using ABP for years and it is a fantastic tool that has made using the internet much easier for me and I enjoy being in control of what sites I can whitelist.  I almost never see annoying pop ups and I love that I do not see advertising while watching YouTube videos.  I highly recommend this tool.  I was using this in Safari and just added it to Chrome since I have the newest version of Safari, and it honestly is not playing well with some websites I visit (website owners are not up to speed with the technology and are telling me to use other browsers), so I am using Chrome on my Mac more frequently.  I will also be downloading this for Edge if it is available (for my laptop).  Thanks for a great extension!

Not sure if you've found a replacement by now, but my recommendation has always been ublock origin (make sure it has origin in its name). It's simply the best blocker out there, hands down. Never experienced a single issue, not once, and it blocks absolutely everything. While at the same time giving you total control of exactly what, when, & where to block, if you choose to do so (optional, it works fine default). It's also the lightest on resources, speeding everything up instead of bogging it down. You can also add/enable/check additional filter lists in its settings. There's even one (or a few) that gets rid of all those annoying "disable adblocker" messages you were referring to.
-------------------------

I've been using this extension for a while now. It always amazes me when I sit with a client who does not have this extension. The sheer number of ads being foisted on users is crazy!  A few get thru ABP. . .but this extension speeds my browsing immensely. Incredibly pleased!!!

cpu
Adblock Plus helped me to prevent the abnormal spike (over 90%) in CPUs core temperatures that occurred upon visiting websites containing poorly coded, CPU-hogging Flash-content, be they ads or non-ads. In addition, Adblock Plus helped with taking out all the notoriously obtrusive, non-Flash Ads in some of the news-websites which offer useful content, but are bad at keeping users' interests above their clueless Ad-Sales Team's interests and their Advertisers' interests.

Moreover, allowing users to whitelist content (ads or non-ads) is the most useful feature. It may require a learning-curve for many folks, but if one can figure out the way to manage that, it offers increased value.

I highly recommend Adblock Plus to every one who desires a rewarding user-experience while making meaningful use of the Web.

Thank you Team EyeO for this great work. May the Force be with you!

I've had ad block plus for so long, and I've loved it, it works great. But now that they're being paid to show specific ads, I'm jumping ship to ublock origins. 
I know there's a way to fix it and block all ads on abp, but I shouldn't have to.
Thanks for the years of ad blocking

Sadly my favorite News sites have so many ads on one page, that it sucks the cycle life out of my speedy computer.  Many of the ads are on slow servers, and the data being fetched takes forever to load.

I had to give it a 3 because it was causing such a delay in my apps opening up. Also, the best thing about this extension is that it did block ads.  Although sometimes an ad would sneak through!  But for those who don't mind waiting so long for your app to open up, this is the best.

One of the best extensions ever. Some ads may still pop up, but thanks to Adblock Plus, most are kept at bay, especially the spammy ones on social networking sites such as facebook. It also helps to improve the performance of your browser when playing games, as a lot of the ads that it blocks would have been using the same plug-in which games on the browser use, thus slowing down the game's functions. With this extension, your web games performance will be enhanced.

Blocks even the nastiest pop-ups, but doesn't interfere with site interaction. Even seems like it speeds up streaming by keeping all the side ads, videos and pop-ups from slowing down computer. Awesome Extension! I would pay for it.

Works perfectly.
The best feature, honestly, is the option to turn it off for certain sites. Some sites will just plague you with ads, but others are legitimate sites trying to just make a small bit of money from ads. As long as the ads are unintrusive, I will turn it off for a site.

Does good job over ublock, though I used before ublock, noticed  many non-english websites with builtin adults ads.
this ext. blocks, but ublock does not. it's simple as that.

It's nice for blocking out intrusive ads, but doesn't stop scripted popups or some Flash embeds from playing.  It also slows everything to a crawl on my new computer.  It's actually slightly faster with the extension disabled!
-------------------------
slow
It's a great tool. Easy to turn off, easy to customize what should get blocked. Simple interface, although the pseudo-regex (using wildcards) pattern you need to use to add to the blocked list is a little tricky... still, it never crashes and doesn't slow down Chrome!

This extension is a Godsend. If I'd looked into this a long time ago it would have saved me hours and hours of frustration. My dinosaur of a laptop just can't keep up with the relentless onslaught of obnoxious ads that every corner of the internet has become infested with. It was taking 12 minutes for my Dell to process all of them every time I wanted to read a newspaper article! I am very happy with ABP and definitely recommend it.

This app is amazing! Most reviews for other products are usually filled with fake reviews so I wasn't holding out much hope this app would be any better than the rest. But, I was willing to give it a try and was very pleased to see this one was actually the real deal. It is extremely rare now that anything gets past it. I visited a sight not long ago that attempted to use the rapid fire method of breaking through ABP but totally failed. I even watched the counter to see if it would make it and it finally gave up at 235 attempts in about 55 seconds. Give it a try and you'll see what I mean.

Thank you so much!

I love it, blocks almost everything I want it to. I'd say my rating is more of a 4.5 rather than a 5, but as I've used it for so long, it certainly deserves my 5.

I know ad revenue pays for the sites I visit, and for a long time I was content to allow them. Two things changed my mind:
1) Ads that take over the screen and refuse to close.
2) Ads that suddenly and unexpectedly start playing video with (loud)sound.
I installed Adblock Plus, and I love it. I realize how great a job it does every time I use a computer that doesn't have it. It's the first extension I install on a new system.

I haven't found an ad that it doesn't block.  It's amazing!  Doesn't slow down the PC, actually speeds it up, because unblocked ads are what slows mine down.

I strongly prefer the Adblock Plus approach of blocking annoying ads will allowing ads that are not annoying (e.g. do not consume cpu resources, etc.).

This encourages all the websites that must depend on advertising to prefer well behaved, non-annoying, static ads.

All ad blockers should follow the lead of Adblock Plus in encouraging responsible and considerate advertisements.

I love this program.  Popup ads are one of the most annoying things on the Internet.  They stop you from seeing things, randomly start blasting annoying videos while you are working, and slow down page loading.

Adblock Plus is excellent i have been looking for something like this for a long time. I am sick and tired of being hit with hundreds of annoying ads every day but now thanks to this zippy chrome add on my life is hassle free
-------------------------
slow
Google Chrome is THE best browser. Google, I am hypnotized by your products... They are simple, dependable, and most importantly, your products are mostly free while still offering a gigantic variety of products and services that people depend upon from day to day. I must admit, even my beloved phone is a Google Android... My iPhone was water damaged in a sea kayaking capsize (the dry-bag was not appropriately closed) and I have been much happier with my Droid! Adblock, you are delightful and you pair with Chrome to(somehow?) create an even smoother browsing experience. Well, it's obviously because of the blocked advertisements. I am devout to both Google and AdBlock. Yesterday I opened my Firefox browser for the first time since reformatting my laptop. It was messy, slow, spammy, something Chrome was not before installing these extensions and applications. After installing the same extensions in Firefox and testing it out for a night, I gave up and quickly ran back into the comforting arms of Google Chrome! Firefox was horrifying. I had to remove so many toolbars and search engines, specifically YAHOO!, that I never installed. No other person has the keys to my laptop either... I always specify "NO" when installing programs that ask. These toolbars were never present within my Chrome and it was my first time opening Firefox since its initial installation. Firefox was a boggy nightmare. Thank you, Google, for so many privileges. I do not take these for granted. Customer service is supreme from my experiences compared to other websites. Considering the overload Google has, it is astonishing to me. Google even pays me! How much more could I, or anyone for that matter, ask of Google?

very helpful, have used for a long time before on firefox, best addon on the web :)
-------------------------
speed
The best extensions are the ones you don't notice; this is one of them. Other than a nifty little icon for re-enabling ads (almost never needed), the only difference it will make: no more ads. It's that easy. The speed of the browser is not noticeably affected, and everything seems to be perfect - only ad-free.
-------------------------
slow
Sorry, but i thinks it works fine. I have NO adds on any site. and it is still much faster than addblock! adblock (that without plus) slows down every webpage i visit. ABP ist still "the same" like adthwart (only the laughing devil i miss :) )
-------------------------
slow
This thing is amazing in the sense that it is a small app that eliminates everything, every ad and pop up...100% of it!!!  I have yet to come across any software program that can actually do this.  Other software programs I have used may also slow down your computer too, but not ABP.  If anything ABP has allowed my system to run faster.
-------------------------
slow
Does not slow down the browsing speed and works for YouTube. Fantastic and highly recommended.
-------------------------
long
Does exactly what I want it to do, I have actually forgotten that some webites even HAVE ads cause I've been using this for so long.
-------------------------
long
So convenient. Everytime I see people waiting for the long youtube ad, I always want to laugh.
-------------------------
slow
Best free ad blocker available. Does slow down the page but only ever slow slighty, others freeze the page for a up to 5-10 seconds, the ones that don't, don't block the ad. The updates aren't obtrusive either like some other chrome apps. 9.5/10 from me.
-------------------------
fast
Works great is fast and non-intrusive(well that's the point).The interface works like you'd expect.
I like the new feature of allowing acceptable adds.  This will hopefully lead to more and more companies prioritising ads that will make the whitelist!
-------------------------
speed
Quite useful. Surfing the net without the stupid ads popping in front of U is a blessing indeed. Not to mention the fact that surfing speed is faster with an this free app.
-------------------------
slow
I love it! It doesn't slow down my computer and it removes all the ads on every webpage. It's nice to be on Pandora or YouTube and not have to listen to any of the stupid ads.
-------------------------
slow
Works great.  When I log into my other email accounts it even blocks the ads that run along the side.  Prevents my computer from slowing down since it keeps all the scripts from running.  Worth downloading!
-------------------------
cpu
Much better than the other 'AdBlock' extension. This one has been around for a very long time, and gets 99% of ads, and who cares about the rare ones that might pop up. The 'AdBlock' version uses a very sluggish method, and cannot display pages  correctly until after it is fully modified. It also increases cpu usage significantly and will drink up netbook batterys like gaterade. This is the best choice for almost every situation. Webpages load FASTER due to less work being done, not slower due to the method the other one uses.
-------------------------
fast
It's perfect!
It's fast and easy to use, I strongly recommend it to everyone that gets annoyed of adds!
What makes it special is, as I said, that it's fast and easy to use. Unlike most adds blockers that slows the browser down and sometimes makes it crash.
-------------------------
slow
Blocks all adverts great!!!!
only cricism is that is slows everything down a bit
-------------------------
long
This is the real Adblock Plus for Chrome. Adblock is completely independent and while competent I personally find it never quite meets the complete standards of Adblock Plus. While not quite as powerful as it's Firefox older brother it gets the job done and also does a flawless job of blocking those annoying YouTube streaming ads. If the occasional text ad happens to slip through (never seen it myself. Have a heart and let them display. Sites need to make their revenue somehow and so long as the ads aren't intrusive (banner, video, flash animation etc) then there's nothing to really complain about.
-------------------------
long
works great on problem sites like put locker and sockshare. lets see how long it holds up :D
-------------------------
slow
Even better than normal AdBlock. This one does everything the old one does, plus this one doesn't slow down my computer. Love it.
-------------------------
long
I've been using this for a very long time and I've loved it... But suddenly I've started having adds again. That needs to be fixed. I loved it though.
-------------------------
light
It is really amazing. I loved it. The extension is light (for both chrome and firefox) and yet powerful. 

But some facebook ads get through.. :(
-------------------------
long
It works great pretty much EVERYWHERE except Livestream and Facebook. It prevents me from seeing a Livestream so I have to turn it off on Livestream and go through video ads. No big deal really.

But Facebook ads are an issue. I notice a lot of them are coming through. That needs to be fixed. Otherwise, awesome extension. Haven't seen an annoying ad anywhere (except Facebook and Livestream) in a long time. It's especially awesome on YouTube.
-------------------------
slow
pros: must have for all chrome, 
cons: there's no "disable for this website" feature, 
and it seems slow down my chrome a bit (but still better than the the other adblock extension). 
last update april? come on guys pay attention to this extension not just the firefox one!
-------------------------
slow
I love this! This does slow down internet a little... not bad enough to even notice on my 15 mb/s down. I'm surprised that google hasn't shut this down because they are the #1 Advertiser...
-------------------------
slow
Superb! Works on 4OD too.  Haven't noticed any slow down with load times. Very happy with this :)
-------------------------
long
I truly do not like ads (to the degree where I will black the screen, mute the speakers, and wait until they are done). I won't go into a long explanation of why, but the point is that this app does a very good job doing what it is supposed to do.
-------------------------
lag
My review being I've had a lot of problems with ads I thought it might be a virus because they were popping up in my FB messages and blocking all side videos related to a video i may have been watching on youtube (BTW I use Chrome) so I just got this and it worked wonders now there are no ads my videos are not lagging by them no ads in my messages it was fantastic And my side videos are now there again..there is sometime a blank box where an ad should be but i think that  may be the virus i may have even so nothings in the box everything else is fantastic Thank you for this so much!
-------------------------

i've been waiting so long for this. thanks,...

cpu
100% CPU usage during google chrome startup
-------------------------
cpu
Works great, the other Adblock extension created  100% CPU load from time to time on my less than powerful laptop.
-------------------------
slow
This slows down my Chrome...it's a very nice  ad blocker, but it makes GIFs flash and slow down everything.
-------------------------
fast
Does not get every single ad on the internet and it lately is letting all ads through. This extension is nice and VERY fast when it's compared to other adblock extensions.

Fix the recent issue of all ads getting through, and try to make it easier to block ads on a page using the "Easy create filter" option.
-------------------------
long
Great extension, definitely worth a download. It could certainly use some streamlining though, several webpages have very long load times, it's not crippling but it is annoying.
-------------------------
fast
This extension is good for me.
It blocks more add's in my web page.
And browsing is fast.
-------------------------
long
I've been using ABP on Chrome/Firefox for a long time.  Works great, does as advertised.
-------------------------
long
Something's gone wrong. lots of ads getting through now.

This is a 2 star rev though as its been really great for a long time.
-------------------------
slow
Faster than Adblock but still not recommended for slow PCs. Is also not guiltware, so that's a plus.
-------------------------
long
I've been using this a long time; it works very well to "de-clutter" the web sites I visit.
-------------------------
fast
I can't believe I've been using the old version and not Adblock Plus for all these years! Finally found this last night when setting up Chrome on my laptop, just got it running on my PC and everything loads super fast now!

blocks ads i didnt expect. no problems so far
-------------------------

Excellent extension blocks all ads i wonder why not many people haven't tried it maybe because of name its ublock not adblock which people usually search
-------------------------

it blocks spotify ads on the web player, nice.

One of the best privacy extensions, it blocks unnecessary scripts with potential privacy leaks very efficiently.
Even if you accidentally open a blocked script, it warns you and lets you allow a specific URL temporarily or permanently if you need it.
I have been using it for more than two years; when it caused the issue, I contacted support on Github, and they were very responsive.
They helped me solve the issue and quickly deployed the solution to the production environment.

Amazing extension this is a free version of youtube premium and blocking ads with success and always does that
-------------------------
block
its great undetected on thing that block adblocker and works on linkverse its just great
-------------------------
block
best general purpose blocker, it blocks ads and pop up websites too
-------------------------
block
As a frequent internet user, it is hard to not get ads shoved down your throat. The uBlock Origin extension is like a force field protecting me from intrusive ads and annoying elements of webpages. It makes browsing Fandom wikis and other websites with 100 septillion ads a whole lot easier. It is also helpful for blocking websites; as a matter of fact, I use it to block embedded TikTok videos and the TikTok site itself (so the CCP spies can't get me). So all in all, uBlock Origin is worth the download.
-------------------------
block
It's not perfect, it's best to have a backup adblocker but there's a reason I've kept this one for many years while the backup often changes. This is the toughest most reliable adblocker I've ever had, too tough for some as it can break some websites. It might not always catch all the ads but the manual blocking tool works great and the ads stay blocked. This extention with a supplementary kinder adblocker for those sites that can't take it has made being on the internet so much easier and less annoying
-------------------------
block
Works almost everywhere and functions better then Brave's built in ad block.

Blocks all the damn ads. Great blocker (:

There are numerous adblocking extensions available in the Chrome store, but THIS is the most effective. It even blocks the annoying two unskippable ads on YouTube, I promise. It also includes some additional tools that can assist you while browsing a website.
-------------------------

Absolute perfect adblocker, Nothing wrong about it, actually its more then an adblocker, also blocking malicious websites in the process incredible, the only adblock i would recommend. Perfect!

very good ad blocker you don't need to pay and can block once for all anything you want
-------------------------

Overall great but I don't like that it blocks Honey by default and it's hard to stop it unless you just turn it off. It gives me the option to add to whitelist, so I choose that and it opens a page with a bunch of code and no other instructions. I figure it's good to go and it's still blocking honey. Would be nice if it made it more clear on how to whitelist chrome addons.

So far the best ad blocker I've gotten. Blocks all of Spotify and other unwanted ads.

Best extension ever.  The internet is almost completely unusable without blocking all of the awful ads even if they didn't have malware.  I also like being able to block useless elements on websites I visit frequently.

I've tried both adblock and adblock plus to block the annoying auto-playing ads on taobao.com to no avail until I tried uBlock Origin, install-and-play, works like a charm, Thank you!

STOPPED WORKING ON GOOGLE.COM AND GMAIL.COM

Does anyone else deal with the blocker blocking the screens that pop up on YouTube when trying to unsubscribe or add something to a playlist? I would just disable the blocker but I also use it as my main ad blocker for YouTube. And if anyone has any ideas on how to fix that'd be cool. Love this blocker though, really good for getting into websites that either want an account or just have hundreds of popups.
-------------------------
block
Well this was a fast update. Turning on cosmetic filtering fixed it, even though it seems like it should block things like that. Whatever. If anyone else has the same issue maybe try this? Good luck!

Best extension for Add block
-------------------------
protect
The best security and protection tool for Chrome. Period. UBlock Origin is the first extension I install on any new Chrome installation.
-------------------------
block
Even blocks youtube ads. Perfect!
-------------------------
block
It does what is says, it is a ad-blocker and it it amazing for low-end computers! No ads or pop-ups about how many ads you blocked, it just gets blocked! And if you want to geek out and block certain items, trackers, anything! Paired with https everywhere it is just anything you need for surfing the web.
-------------------------
block
Simply Amazing. Better than other adblocker extensions. I tested 3 adblockers/content blockers (including this one), and found that Ublock Origin was able to block content much effectively. It also offers multiple customization options to users.
-------------------------
block
It works perfectly! It's heavily customizable and very versatile as not just an adblocker, but also a tool to hide various annoying prompts, like cookie prompts and newsletter signups. It even blocks pop-ups saying to disable adblockers. It also can be used to save data by blocking large things like autoplaying videos and 4K images, helping sites load faster and lowering the internet bills.
-------------------------
block
Best adblocker available to download. If this ever goes paid I will absolutely buy it. Ontop of blocking ads you can also zap certain webpage elements which is PERFECT for when social media sites like twitter ruin the UI as you can just remove that part completely. They also don't sell your info like adblock plus does.
-------------------------
block
Works great. Free and open-source. GPLv3. The project specifically refuses donations and instead advises supporters to donate to maintainers of block lists. Absolutely amazing.
-------------------------
block
Great extension for web security, and by far the best for blocking ads.
-------------------------
block
Better than Adblock Plus. ABP is great especially combined with a browser with built in adblocking, but it only goes so far, there are still some ads that can get through them such as ones built into video player clients (no other adblocking method I've tried has been able to stop them besides uBlock Origin). uBlock also blocks other ads too, but I was mostly concerned with trying to get the ads baked into video players to go away.
-------------------------
block
Years, years of using this extension and they all of a sudden can't block a youtube ad? Yah i get it dudes are using bar soap now, they aren't but okay I get it some Etsy storefront bought an ad campaign. You've got a week Ublock.

Incredible add block just add a mobile app please all the ones online are horrible

I love it. It blocks all ads...
-------------------------

This ad blocker is amazingly useful and for free as well. I was also surprised by the vast types on adverts this come extension blocks.
-------------------------
block
Blocks. Out. EVERYTHING!! It's really amazing. It even works a little too well sometimes when I click on affiliate links like youtube sponsors and such, but that's what the disable button is for.
-------------------------
block
Best ad blocker by far I've used it for about a year no I've had no problems and i love how it blocks ads from YouTube and other things which is really nice, easily best ad blocker out there
-------------------------
block
Quite literally essential when browsing the internet. There are so many intrusive, distracting, obstructive and just annoying ads nowadays, you can't go without a solid adblocker, and this one is the solid-est of them all.

Also works with annoying UI elements on websites that don't contribute to anything and just waste space, like most of the fandom wiki website.

You can even block entire websites from appearing at all! You can even block the little recommendation bar that appears when you pause a youtube video on a third-party website
-------------------------
block
This is a great adblocker had it from the day I got my computer and it blocks ads like they are not even there and its all for free too love this app I give it a 5 Star

AMAZING AD BLOCKER!!!

Did everything I wanted it too, even let me block free trial end screens. Super useful, I love it!!!

Never got an ad ever in YouTube for a year now and I'm surprised and it works perfectly fine. It blocks every ads but there are some ads that still displays if you go into a sussy website but I don't rlly mind since it's on the side but it blocks annoying ads that are like fake messages, redirect popups suspicious links, popups, etc. This is the best adblock extension in my opinion.
-------------------------

it blocks all ads in YouTube and other sites as well THIS IS THE BEST!!!1 DOWNLOAD IT NOW

Recently new to this haven't used all of the functions yet but, this is still a truly fascinating thing. It blocks all of the unwanted ads in you're way and there is probably a lot more to this extension.

Amazing ad-blocker, works great. Tried a few other popular ad-blockers before but so far this one is the best and also not detected by many websites unlike the others. Blocking is great also protects against unsecure websites. The filters are really good. Keep up the good work.
-------------------------
block
best adblocker, after switching from my old adblocker this adblocker has been blocking more ads and blocking malware websites. 100% recommend it :)
-------------------------
block
A very good extension, blocking very annoying ads some of which even make a website almost unnavigable or even  leading you to malicious websites. Makes web surfing fast and enjoyable(In short, it is a very efficient ad blocker and it promotes your web security).
-------------------------
block
Its works well and blocks ads but will slow down your computer a little bit.
-------------------------
block
Ublock has been a nice reliable and customizable blocker over the years. There is more power there than I need. The best features are the automated ones and ability to right clock block elements since most people aren't going to spend a lot of time figuring out complex options.

PLEASE add ability to easily block entire sites. Look at all the low quality site blocker/time management apps people download. Ublock could be getting some of that traffic by simply add in the ability to block entire sites or even add in time periods to block sites at certain times as these are SUPER easy options compared to the other coding the developers have done to filter out specific elements. A nice right click block entire site option would be nice.
-------------------------
block
WOW can't believe this is free, thanks origin blocked all the ads!
-------------------------
detect
This extension cant detect facebook ads trackers
-------------------------

Simple, effective, does what you need, can be turned on and off easily, blocks unwanted video ads.

-------------------------

THIS IS AMAZING
it's the original one, it blocks ads and it's quick and easy to figure out! I really recommend this. It's my first time ever using a ad blocker and i'm really happy it's turned out so well! I will recommend this to my friends. tho the first time it blocked a ad smth popped up 4 a sec. Think it was a ad... but it quickly it    was removed so I think it worked! It's amazing any you HAVE to try it. Like it's just to good-
-------------------------
protect
nice adblock also protects you from viruses, hacker and other stuff like that! doesn't really black ads it just like makes them sorta invisible but it's good!
-------------------------
block
The fact that it broke and I realized exactly how much it was blocking before I repaired it made me come here specifically to give it a 5 star review. amazing blocker.
-------------------------
block
Perhaps the only adblocker that works perfectly with Amazon.com without breaking it! It blocks those pesky sponsored posts and the added "Element Picker Mode" allows you to block whatever else annoys you on Amazon's Home Page. Simply fantastic!
-------------------------
block
The plugin works incredibly well, it completely blocks advertisements, tracking cookies like the little facebook icon, and all of the pop-ups that appear. Unlike some Adblocker programs, uBlock doesnt make exceptions to advertisements unless you specify (other adblockers allow advertisers to pay extra to allow their ads through the blocker). I have never had a problem with uBlock, there is no nonsense about it and it has a large team of people working on it. Since it's open-source, the entire program is public to read, so it is almost undoubtedly safe
-------------------------
block
Works great, lots of options to dial in exactly what you want, and lets you choose to block almost any element on a web page, even if it's not an add, by right clicking and adding a filter. Been using uBlock Origin for years, definitely my favorite adblock extension.
-------------------------
block
I find this to be the most reliable and easy to use of ad-blockers. No nonsense, and it really does a great job of blocking malicious websites and pop-ups. If anything it's too effective sometimes.
-------------------------
block
It amazes me how people still complain about ads on YouTube videos. Either watch them and shutup, or get an adblock. They don't even know they've existed for like 20 years now. And this one happens to be the most comprehensive, lightweight, and most efficient overall ad block.
-------------------------
block
I love this ad-blocked 
It blocks all of the ads and bypass the anti adblockers ITS AWSOME it even block ghost CPU miners witch is great  

but only sometimes it capture a "NOT" ad and the website stopes loading like trust piolet but doesnt matter its great i love it
-------------------------
block
Best ad blocker. It let us block almost all ads from the internet.
-------------------------

amazing adblocker that has worked right out of the block for me for several years. could not have asked for anything more.

i love it doesn't try to bs me easy to use blocks ads and doesn't ask me to pay for anything would download agien

Best ad and content blocker, the real deal. Even if something slips past once, you can block it manually and it will never appear again.
-------------------------
block
i love this and i wounded how they earn money from blocking ads , i am little bit of scared of collecting data..good work its make mo productivity
-------------------------
block
You can whitelist the sites, or even specific pages quite easily, by clicking the extension icon when it is over aggressively blocks site elements.. Presto changeo!
-------------------------

OMG! I just figured out how to block the ANNOYING pop-ups that Facebook throws up because I refuse to create an account. Now, I can look at my son's school's Facebook page in peace. THANK YOU!!!!!
-------------------------
block
It has saved my life on my computer MULTIPLE TIMES! And it blocks ads. It does it's job and gets you out of websites that might steal your personal information which is really handy. This is one of the times today that it has saved me and that's why i'm writing this review. I had another extention on and it said my credit card information was public. I meant to hit the X but it sent me to a site and uBlock Origin saved me because it was going to steal my information. Thank you and this is why I give you five stars.
-------------------------
block
Love it but I wish it supported blocking twitch ads. I'd even pay for that.
-------------------------
block
Doesn't even block Youtube ads anymore. It was a good run UBlock, I gave you two weeks to figure it out.
-------------------------
block
Its very POG blocks viruses and ads on any website (thats on chrome)
-------------------------
block
This is the perfect extension, if your me; a normal school peep who needs this for websites that pop up SO many ads, there rlly annoying for me. Dont hesitate to get this, its free and perfect to block ads :D
-------------------------
block
This is actually so good, just need to right click on what I wanted to delete and highlight it and boom gone permanently and if I needed to get a part back, I can just go into the my filters and delete it from there and I learned all this just a few minutes ago when this post was made, so I highly recommend anyone who has that annoying feature on their favourite site or for any ads (which this does automatically), this is very good indeed. (Edit): When it stopped blocking ads I just reinstalled and that did the job, until they update that's probably the way to fix the issue. And you can import anything you want removed.
-------------------------
block
Works perfectly. Blocks all ads on youtube, and all pop up ads. Even blocks ads on spotify and more! Absolutely incredible, highly recommend it to anyone who is sick of ads.

Blocks ads and other unwanted elements and does it incredibly well, Never had an issue for the past 2 years.

 Thank you for making it

Dear Raymond Hill,

This adblocker... is unlike any adblocker I've ever seen. One time when I was on PowerPoint Mobile online, I saw that Ublock Origin blocked 103 ads on that page. That's insane. The adblocker I had before this adblocker was called Adblocker - Stop Ads on Every Site. This adblocker didn't even block ads on YouTube!!! But this one does. That's very convenient for me and is AWESOME to see. I love your product, man!!! ❤
-------------------------
block
Hands down best ad blocking extension I have used over the years. After switching to this one 4-5 years ago, I haven't looked back. I did however getting some youtube ads starting today 5/20/2021. It would be awesome if those go away soon so I don't have to consider other extensions.
-------------------------
block
By far the best ad blocking software, used Ad Block for years but after trying UBlock I will tell anyone reading this review it def works on those nasty pop up ads so I can watch my favorite movies TV shows sports, hopefully you get my drift...lol
Well done UBlock team, keep up the great work.

This is an adblocker I have been using for about 3 weeks now, and I just have to say that I love it. It's amazing, and works just fine for me. When I go to sites to watch dramas, they usually have a lot of pop-up ads. With this extension, it doesn't happen anymore. Same for youtube. I don't have to deal wit ads there anymore! There's also another website that I use to watch dramas. If anyone in here likes to watch kdramas/cdramas/jdramas/reality shows, you have definitely hear if Viki. I use the basic account, no Viki Pass/Viki Pass Plus, so I have to go through the ads and all. This adblocker actually blocks them all. Some inefficient ones can't go through Viki and Viki will usually tell you to turn off your adblocker. Howevere, this adblocker is just amazing. Anyways, I don't think theres any bad parts (not any yet, at least).

Fantastic ad blocker. Very occasionally you'll find it fails to block the 5 second "Vrbo" ads with the little pie-shaped countdown on YouTube, but I haven't had the jarring noises of ads in my ear in years.
-------------------------

I hate ads. 
I have been using this extension for quite a bit now, without realizing what it was doing. Recently, I had to format my PC, and I was shocked with the amount of ads present in my everyday websites!! YouTube is impossibly irritating, every video now has an ad prior, which I didn't know BECAUSE THIS EXTENSION WORKS!! (Even Gmail has some fake emails to display ads, which I also didn't know, because this blocks even that!)

Definitely recommend

Never had a problem with ublock. also, it has helped me a lot since I've entered unwanted websites and ublock, blocks them, and it's the most powerful ad blocker out there. I've never had an ad since I installed ublock.

I've been using this app for a long time. It doesn't pester me to buy anything, doesn't pester me to check my settings all the time. Sometimes, I forget I have it.

It just WORKS, quietly and efficiently, in the background, blocking more ads than any other extension. 

Absolutely indispensable. Thank you to the person or people who made it.

i LOVE how you can block specific elements

Perfect ad blocker. It's not the built in opera one that still lets in youtube ads that are just blank. It blocks everything but google page ads. Can't do anything about that one.

Fantastic x1000!!! My favorite feature is the element zapper (the lightning bolt after you click the ublock icon in the top right) - this gets rid of banners that follow you through the whole page which blocks a huge chunk of the screen and any other intrusive part of a website. I wish I could get this on my phone and really, in my life!
-------------------------
block
The best ads block, hope i day it can block facebook ads again.
-------------------------

DYNAMITE! This extension supremely exceeds my expectations. All I expected it to do when I first added it to my web browser was to just block annoying pop-ups but it also blocks my YouTube ads. Not only that, there is also a neat feature called "Block element..."! This may be TMI, but I had an assignment on Google Classroom from a previous semester which I wasn't satisfied with my grade, though my teacher would not let me redo it. Sometimes I would accidentally click on old assignments, and it the grade on that assignment still haunted me every time I saw it, even though it was from the past. I used the "Block element" feature to hide my grade and comments from my teacher on that specific assignment from my view. Bam! I don't have to see any unwanted negativity from the past. This extension is a MUST-HAVE! 😁
-------------------------
block
I've been using uBlock Origin for years and it's the best ad blocker out there! It blocks every single kind of ad aggressively. Pages even load much faster as a result, I also love the element blocking feature. BTW, great job! much more than an ad blocker!

Literally the best adblocker on the web. Even bypasses those stupid "verification" things on sites like Linkvertise and just gives you the direct link. IDK how it works, but I am extremely thankful. <3
-------------------------

I use it in addition to AdBlock. It's a lot more effective at blocking bothersome content. It's worth noting that once in a while but rarely it blocks content you want to see such as a video. So if something like a video appears blank then turn off uBlock and refresh the page. The best aspect of uBlock is that lots of website have picked up on people using the most common blocker, AdBlock, and so these websites insist that you turn off AdBlock before proceeding. The websites always fail to do this with uBlock though so you can still do what you set out to and block those bothersome ads. Brilliant.

I love this ad blocker, it blocks all ads on everything. It even blocks YouTube adds which I really like.

Highly recommend this extension for blocking ads. It works exactly the way it says it does.

The issue with Twitch ads coming through is annoying, but I think that is Twitch not Ublock failing.

Great adblock (unlike adblock plus) this blocks all the ads I've seen and is very light. Even improves performance in some cases due to the removal of ads that were taking up processing power

Best adblocker I have ever used. Most websites can't even detect it, so if there is a website saying ''disable your adblocker to enter'', it won't do that for uBlock Origin.

been using it for a year now and it blocks all adds on youtube and other websites

After this latest update Twitch ads came back. This extension was incredible. If it starts blocking Twitch ads again then it will officially be the best in my opinion.

the only ad block worth using

Pretty good adblocker until it stopped blocking ads on Youtube and Twitch.

For an essential extension, the features are minimal and the expectation is only on performance and how well the extension is in blocking the ads. Had no performance issues and definitely had more effect than its competitors.

Came here to write a review after getting ads again on Twitch.tv. This is hands down the best adblock out there and I hope they find a way to block twitch.tv ads again.

I normally use Adblock plus however, they don't block the ad blocker popup so I switched to uBlock and I'm very happy and can confirm that they are also removing that. So I will be using this software.  Thank You!!!

great to block malicious content when visiting websites

blocks about every ad out there. i recommend this to everyone i know.

block
Absolutely brilliant product, blocks almost every ad and redirect on almost every site. Way better than I expected.

The absolute best. Even for ads it doesn't detect, it gives you a little tool to have them removed for yourself permanently. This just blows all the other adblockers out of the water. i tried adblock, adblock plus, and other various blockers, once i found Ublock there was no turning back. its free and gives you the internet the way it was meant to be.

uBlock Origin works like a CHARM!!! You will have a complete protection against ads, cookies and malwares if you use these: Google built in Cookies block, uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger.

Google built in Cookies block, uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger = Complete protection

I've used this extension for years and I love it.  Continues to work and stops 99.9% of the ads you don't want to see.  And whitelisting sites that detect an ad blocker is easy to do as well.

Never had an issue using uBlock Origin. I use it on all my browsers along with Decentraleyes, and Cookie Autodelete. I highly recommend using all 3 together as a regimen for protection.

It's nice but it doesn't block white pop up ads on youtube videos

Literally the most amazing adblocker. Started using it in 2019. Absolutely amazing. Never once had a problem. Only complaint is that some ads aren't blocked but since there is a manual element blocker it's practically not a complaint but a TINY flaw which is fine. Nothing's perfect.
-------------------------

Blocks EVERYTHING. Its reliable and keeps ads away from me at all times. Would recommend.

The best of the best ad blockers! I have used this ad blocker for years and has always worked 1000% better than the competing ad blockers! If you want to block all ads then say no more because uBlock Origin has you covered!
-------------------------
block
The best Adblocker, ever. 0 ads everything blocked :)
-------------------------
block
Pretty good adblocker with room for improvement.  While ublock does have the most stringent ad blocking it's a completely scorched earth product by default.  Unlike the original adblock there's not an easy way to operate in a blacklist mode instead of a whitelist mode (blacklist meaning ads are allowed unless you blacklist the site you are on at which point they are blocked).  .Ideally with one or two clicks it could be changed to a blacklist mode blocker.

The performance is good, and the amount of ads that are blocked is unrivaled.  Good product overall but I prefer the original adblock so I can allow more easily allow sites some ad revenue by default and only block them if their ads are obnoxious.
-------------------------
detect
I haven't had a single ad since adding to Chrome and few sites detect it. It also has interesting tools for changing the view of a website.
-------------------------
block
Very good @ blocking annoying ads and dangerous malvertisements. Would recommend it.

Have used this for years and it has worked well. In the last couple of day I've notice that it seems to block nothing. I uninstalled it and reinstalled and seems to work fine now. Thanks for keeping junk off my browser.
-------------------------

Good AdBlocker, but causes an error with YouTube when it blocks an ad on a video. That definitely needs working on.
-------------------------
block
this app is strong. i Love the interface. specially for using Block All Popups Button easily
-------------------------
block
The best ad block extension I have ever used. Undetectable by pages that require whitelist, blocks all ads on pages, not only popups, but TrafficJunky and similar services as well. No more annoying ads on YouTube, Twitch.tv and similar pages. Custom rules, filters, whitelists, IP blocks, everything can be edited in HTML as well as be transferred across clients and platforms (for advanced users and developers). Extension is supported on GitHub as well. I absolutely love it! 5 stars!
-------------------------
block
FANTASTIC extension. element picker mode is very underrated. i blocked a lot of clutter using it. unwanted sidebars, footers, advertisement panels, unwanted videos and sections, etc.  you can literally reshape what some websites look like. highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
It is user-friendly and does its job well. Ever since I installed this app, it has helped me blocked many unnecessary adds and at the same time it has allowed chrome to run faster
-------------------------

uBlock is extremely effective. It blocks all ads before YouTube videos, during Spotify jam sessions, and on those sites that are normally covered in pop-ups. It has not slowed my computer or browsing experience at all, and I am very satisfied with its performance.

Switched from adblock plus over to this and all I can say is its even better!!! I should have made the switch years ago, this literally blocks ALL popups. There were certain sites that even adblock plus failed to block but this extension is amazing!!!

this is literally the best ad block in the world
-------------------------

uBlock Origin is a fantastic ad-blocker; it's the only one I use. Easy on system resources, and 100% effective against blocking ads and tracking scripts. The pop-up interface is straightforward and customizing the extension's settings is very easy. Highly recommend.
-------------------------

Best adblocker ever. Even blocks ads from Youtube and hulu!
-------------------------

This is the best adblock out there for me. it worked better than AdBlock which blocked some ads but after refresh it didn't but UBlock did the work and perfectly. Recommended
-------------------------

I've tried almost every adblocker that doesn't look like it will give your computer a virus and this one was by far the best. Didn't affect battery life and I haven't seen a single ad since i downloaded it, while other adblockers let a few ads through here and there. Also, it's the only adblocker of the multiple I've tried that actually blocks ads on twitter. By far the best adblocker out there.
-------------------------
detect
Easily 5 stars despite being detected on some websites. Built-in anti-anti adblocker doesn't really work but that doesn't matter since it is already convenient enough to enable and disable the extension with just two clicks.
-------------------------

-------------------------
block
So used to this app and how well it works that using a machine without it looks bizarre and bloated. Works great "out of the box" but with a few tweaks you'll never see annoyances or ads again. Be sure to know how to whitelist a site if you find its blocking an element you need. Don't leave a negative review because you don't understand or know how to do something, that's on you not uBlock.
***Be sure to use uBlock ORIGIN only not uBlock***

I've been using this for years and recommend it to EVERYONE. It doesn't block 100% of the ads, but I would say a close 98%. Facebook is so much easier to read now without all the ads. And I love looking up to the corner and seeing how many ads have been blocked. :)
-------------------------

Ive tried a few different ad blockers and this by far is the best so far blocks all ads and even by passes sites that have restrictions on blocking ads big thumbs up here

Best adblocker by far. Extremely efficient, blocks almost all of those "please disable your adblocker" popups, and has useful features like the element zapper. Full recommendation from me.

Finally, an adblock that blocks even the "You're using ads! Ads."

No problems, works great.

I've been using it for a couple months now. It works amazingly, though for some sites it blocks too much, but turning it off for select sites just by pressing the power button in the corner is easy.

I like this extension, it really block unwanted ads from popping up my screen. recommended
-------------------------
block
A functional and efficient open-source extension with customizable block lists that are updated frequently.

This extension is useful for many things, not just ad blocking. For instance, if I want to take a screenshot of a webpage, I can use the thunderbolt icon to remove elements from a webpage I don't want, then take the screenshot. 
You can remove elements aside from ads.

I don't really use ublock for adblock, I mainly just use it to block malware (enabling the malware lists and unbreak filters) and remove elements as I see fit. It's good for this purpose because of its excellent customizability.
-------------------------
block
Saves lots of clicks. Blocks most annoying in your face ads. Easy to disable for one site, and it automatically remembers the setting for that site.

I literally googled this extention after having it for months. It's blocked hundreds of thousands of ads and it even lets me watch Hulu uninterrupted. Best blocker ever.

Flawlessly blocks ads, especially the ones on twitch which other adblockers seem to struggle with. I'm curious though if there's any other adblockers that can block twitch ads now.
-------------------------

This extension sometimes doesnt work and shows ads i noticed this on roblox and YouTube but overall it's pretty good Edit: It seems to work alot more better as it has yet to let ads through or fail to block. Idk how old this review is since i cannot find it myself. Been using this for years tho id say its a great adblocker.

block
It was amazing for a while, but starting to see ads on Twitch and Youtube now. Please update! This was my only saving grace for ad blocking.
-------------------------
block
I was so sick of mediocre ad blocking extensions, but then I found this one. No, its name and interface aren't as attractive as some of the bigger ones out there, but the point of an effective ad blocker is to do its job in the background. You're supposed to be able to forget it's there while it performs at 100%. And it's supposed to actually block ads instead of just letting some of them slip through.
This does exactly that.
Recommended use: Combine with Anti Adblock Killer.
-------------------------

Very efficient, easy to use, and able to back up your own whitelists. Excellent ad / popup blocking extension!

Thanks Raymond Hill for making this awesome extension. Super easy, configurable and less heavy on resources. It's sad to see Chrome finally going to make this extension unusable in few months. But till then I'll use it faithfully. Tried switching to Firefox for privacy but a lot of websites had very sluggish performance and it became quite unresponsive with a few sites. 

Thankfully, I got Steven Black host file installed to be prepared for the D-day. It is not as effective as uBlock Origin and doesn't block Google search ads, Youtube ads. But still it's working okayish.
-------------------------

Actually I'm amazed by how small yet powerful it is.
It can block ads in videos, by all means. in China, it worked although not great but fine.
Hope they will continue to maintain it.

Outstanding all around, works extremely well. Protects my computer from harmful sites, blocks ads everywhere, and allows easy workarounds if I need to set up website-specific permissions. 
100% recommended, easy and free.

excellent extension.  Just worried that Google is going to block this in an upcoming Chrome patch.  We value privacy and freedom to surf.    Please do not block nor inhibit this extension.   Thanks.

My default adblocker. It blocks with impunity.

Blocks pretty much every ad!

ive had it for 10 minutes. Its blocked over 15k ad elements. i love it

It's the best ad-blocker I have ever used! So many options for blocking, you can even block things that are just unwanted in a web-page!
-------------------------
block
3 stars now as it no longer blocks ads on Twitch. definite 5 stars if it's fixed!
-------------------------
protect
It's a shame we have to use this to protect ourselves like this but in the battle against raging spamfests and infected flash ads, Raymond Hill should be heralded as an angel of freedom. Ublock Origin is the most seemless undemanding and efficient blocker I've ever used.(and I used host files in the late 80's)   Highly recommended

Waaaaaaaaaaaay better than Adblock. I like to watch some stuff from CBS on the laptop and it detects Adblock and I have to sit through ads. CBS doesn't detect uBlock and I can watch an entire show AD FREE!!!
-------------------------

Works even on pages where other adblocks gets detected and page locks content!

Works like a charm but once again places like Crunchyroll bypassed it for their overblown ads to show on everything. Needs updated again.

Ekstensi block iklan terbaik,
sudah coba ABP, Adguard, uBlock, tapi masih kalah dengan ublock origin 

Open Source, Free, Ringan, Konfigurasi Mudah
-------------------------
block
I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.

"Our website is having trouble interacting with your ad blocking software. If you’re experiencing issues we apologize and suggest that you try disabling your current ad blocker or switching to a different ad block provider. Thank you.

-------------------------
block
This is the only ad blocker that works right for me. 
I have tried some of the others and they block on almost everything. 
This is the only one that does not slow down  my PC 
And Vivaldi Browser works so much better than CHrome. IMO
-------------------------
block
I could never go back to how horrible the web was before ad-blockers, with pop-ups and blinking banner-ads everywhere. Now all is clean and nice. Web developers need to make advertising less intrusive or people will always block ads.
-------------------------
block
This is the best aadblock no doubt about it, and the function to block specific elements from loading in a specific webpage is a very useful tool.
-------------------------
block
Great ad block add on. The best ever!
-------------------------
block
This extension is excellent and blocks an enormous number of ads and behavior tracking systems for me. Use this as your ad blocker. I've never had any issues with it. 

It's also built by a few developers who don't even take donations and are doing it for the common good - such an inspiration.
-------------------------
block
The best ad-blocker I've tried. I particularly like how easy it is to turn on or off. There are some sites I don't want to block the ads for, such as when I'm watching a YouTuber who depends on ad revenue. uBlock remembers which sites you don't want to block the ads for as well, so you don't have to remember to switch it back on or off.
-------------------------
block
I think this is the best Ad block so far. Thank you
-------------------------
block
Ublock is the best ad blocker i've seen by miles. Blocks ads that others couldn't.
-------------------------
block
good work and the best ad blocking extension , thanks !
-------------------------
block
I love being able to forget that YouTube has ads. And Spotify's web player.

Notable features: Element zapper (hold shift to keep using it), disable all blocking for the current site with one click (with complimentary reload button nearby), manual site blocking, premade lists for malicious and undesireable site blocking (sites such as ad redirects), easy options to disable said blocking temporarily (a few minutes) or permanently when encountering a blacklisted site.

I haven't used these, but it seems useful to have options to block "all popups," "large media elements" (i.e. autoplaying videos), and JavaScript (I'm afraid to know when you'd need that).
-------------------------
block
By now a lot better than ABP. Takes less time to load and there's practically no site targeting it. What I would love is to have the possibility to block Cookie Agreements as well, they've become more annoying than ads itself. They're everywhere. I don't know whether this is possible or not, but would be a great great feature.
-------------------------
block
Works perfectly and can block most adds in every site. Love it!
-------------------------
block
Really helpful in blocking popups and ads that usually give my PC problems or even downloads viruses. Would recommend!
-------------------------
block
It is open source ... so I could glance at the code if I wanted to. And it allows me to just block what I want: malware and those annoying card overlays on YouTube while allowing other sites to support themselves. (Repo: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)
-------------------------
block
It has a lot of options and can delete really any block. I have tried several other addblockers - but this one is the only one with really a lot of options!
-------------------------
block
Super easy to enable/disable and super helpfull community!! Totally recommend.

I've had a couple sited that didn't get blocked properly, one post on reddit forum and within hours it was fixed :D
-------------------------
block
Blocks ads and popups on pornhub!! I love it!!!
-------------------------
block
The best adblocker out there; it blocks every single ad.
-------------------------
block
Just a heads up: this extension blocks some *not* popups. Notably on Canvass & other University related websites.
-------------------------
block
Use the Logger for X sites. And when you see an entry like "Popup" for the specific site, click on it, select Block, then click on Create to make a custom filter for that Popup. Also, the uBlock drop-down menu has a button that says "click to block popups on this site", click on it.
-------------------------
block
Excellent ad blocker that seamlessly functions while I use the browser. Doesn't slow it down so far and truly blocks everything!
-------------------------
block
Excellent. Blocks everything and it's really good for low-resource computers.
-------------------------
block
Been using this extension for years now, and thoroughly enjoy having it. It has saved me so much time from not having to watch advertisements and I am very grateful for that. However, please come out with an update to block Twitch ads again.
-------------------------
block
Amazing. Blocks more then any other ad blocker. Using it for years already
-------------------------
block
Reliable, Fast and and thorough! uBlock Origin is seriously one of the best add-ons you can get for a browser and should be running on everyone's internet browser. It doesn't get in your way and block the websites you want to access [unless they're actually malicious] like other AdBlocker services do.
-------------------------
block
This from my experience is the greatest ad block extension available, you can filter for what you want manually, or add in bulk by copying filter lists, allowing for great versatility over other ad block software I've tried, it's also a relatively light extension as far as high end ad block extensions come, so that's another big plus, I can't fault Ublock-Origin at all, it's a must.
-------------------------
block
[ Overview ]   Best product. Blocks ads and unwanted content most of the time most of the time
[ To advertisers ]   If you break through, I close the page and make sure to NOT buy your stuff
[ To devs ] Often I CAN select the only valuable part of the website (actual text) with "block selected". Please add feature "only show selected". Otherwise wide empty margins (for killed ads) show up.
Also, please add features "toggle/remove user filter for this page".
-------------------------
block
First one that have blocked advanced coin mining
Thank you
-------------------------
block
I just want to say to the devs. You are like gods. The gods haveth bestowed a blocker that kills everything. ABP doesn't even compare! This isn't an adblocker as sites don't see it as one. It's a "U" blocker as in i block all "U" ads.
-------------------------
block
I love it /block disturb advertising
-------------------------
block
First thing I did was go to twitch.tv, and attempt to view a stream. And an ad played, so going back to my old ad blocker which actually blocks all ads.
-------------------------
block
I use a LAN level micro-server to block about 90% of ads on my network, but the few that manage to slip through are always caught by uBlock Origin. I've used it for as long as I can remember, and it's still the best in my honest opinion. 10/10 would recommend
-------------------------

This is the best ad block that you can get. I had it with Mozilla Firefox and wondered why Firefox always blocked more adds and pop-ups than Chrome did and this is the answer.
-------------------------

Awesome. Blocks all the noise.

In short terms, the best ad blocker I have ever used. It blocks every ad I've seen so far, and it doesn't slow down Chrome at all. A must have, for sure.
-------------------------

thanks for the ad-blocker, it works great and you can choose elements to block

Love this so much! It blocks all ads; youtube, google ads, everything

Really good ad-blocker, also allows you to block certain elements that you don't like

Since AdBlock sold out and is now serving custom ads, uBlock is a MUST HAVE.
Blocks advertisements so well I cant even imagine the internet without it.

First thing I reinstall after an OS wipe.

Blocks way more ads than ADBP, very simple and easy to use interface.
-------------------------
detect
With so many sites detecting AdBlock and it eating so many resources, switching to this was an easy choice, especially after reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews for the tool. I already use it in Mozilla and I kept forgetting to install it here. Now I've done it, and all is well with my world.
-------------------------
block
Amazing, blocks 30% more ads than AB and ABP and blocks 110% more ads than AdGuard. 10/10
-------------------------
block
It has more ads info to block ads almost from anything.
-------------------------
block
You really can't go wrong with this. Low resource usage, effective ad-blocking, and a little bit of security on top of it all, blocking dangerous popups from running on your browser. They offer an easy-access method of allowing certain ads as well, to support sources that you believe deserve them. Overall, just easy to use, effective, and very minimal in it's footprint for being so effective. It beats out every competitor, in every way.
-------------------------
block
uBlock is by FAR the best ad blocker I've used, it has a clean control panel, and it actually blocks every single ad, no popups.
-------------------------
block
uBlock better than adblock plus, bc adblock plus can't block so many popups ads, uBlock totally resolved my issue, no more popups now
-------------------------
block
Love this adblocker! one of the best ones that I have found. But still there is one problem where it wont block ads on some other sites like fandom.wikia I would love for that to be fixed.

Anyway, it is a great extension!
-------------------------
block
Great alternative to adblock which in my case would not block a single ad for some reason. Fast and Lite what's not to like?
-------------------------
block
Adblock and Adblock plus stopped blocking a lot of video websites a while ago. This does the trick! :D
-------------------------
block
They don't accept money from advertisers to unblock their ads, unlike AdBlock Plus does. It has more  ad blocking power; it's clean and lightweight.
-------------------------
block
AMAZING!!!

i love it so much there are websites such as gogoanime that have so many ads but this blocked them all. i no longer see any in fact i'm grateful they were very disturbing.

 Thank you

It is a very good ad blocker. It blocks most things without an issue and handy to unblock things as needed.

I like that it does not make anything slower.

Ah, uBlock Origin. That little icon sits in the top corner, never getting looked at. Until you log on to a new computer for the first time and realise how much undesirable web content it manages to block. Adding this and Privacy Badger are my first two steps after opening a new computer's browser for the first time.
-------------------------
block
This is the best extension for Chrome that you should use. Stops junk ads, trackers, js miners, etc. If they were to perfect blocking malicious websites actions, this would be the only blocker you'd ever need.
-------------------------
block
Works great!  It even blocks ads on video streaming.
-------------------------
block
uBlock is an amazing blocker that'll block just about everything you come across. Pair it with uMatrix, and you'll be protected against scripts as well.

Keep in mind, uBlock lost support for blocking YouTube ads a while back, so you will need to pick up a separate YouTube ad blocker on the Chrome Web Store.
-------------------------
block
Switched after I got fed up with AdBlock failing to block intrusive ads on multiple sites. And works great and an i like the ui.
-------------------------

How can I donate?
Efficient and reliable.
Also includes additional options to increase navigation speed.
The best so far to block pop-up windows.
Best app removing ad-blocker warning.

Absolutely love it!
blocks ads, pop-ups, bitcoin miners, easily the best ad-blocker i've ever tried.

Really good extension! Blocks ads wonderfully and my pages load in just a matter of seconds!
-------------------------
block
use add block for YouTube to completely eradicate add's.
-------------------------
block
Runs marvelously! Came from using adblock plus as it basically allowed many ads that should have been blocked since the dev's grey area of "acceptable ads" was getting wider and wider by the second. To each his own and there's no shame in making money and I'll just exercise my freedom to go with Ublock Origin. Also, Ublock is WAY WAY lighter on memory than adblock plus which was one the two major reasons I switched, great work!
-------------------------
block
This is still by far the best straight ad-blocker

• It uses significantly less CPU and memory resources than ABP, AB or Adblock Edge (check the µBlock github wiki page for benchmarks). The codebase is brand new, and openly developed on Github.

• It blocks as well or better than these do.

• It doesn't track you like AB does.

The developer is very friendly and active (as well as being open about his intentions), also check out his more detailed blocking extension, HTTPSwitchboard. An amazing extension!
-------------------------

It really is the best popup blocker and I'm taking into account every aspect of efficiency including speed, AI, interface, popups blocked, 'false positives', etc...

Really happy with this so far. Has a better interface than ABP and has more options (e.g. $important, so I can override list exceptions, e.g. ||facebook.com$important to block all facebook.com content, overriding the EasyList exceptions. Seems a lot faster than ABP as well.
-------------------------
block
A great ad and tracking blocker, that lets the users define how much they want to block. 
A great way to only accept a minimal amount of ads that's not ridiculously annoying.
-------------------------
block
Works great, blocks ads, doesn't take as much memory and is open source. What more could you ask for?
-------------------------
block
This is very helpful! I love it! It blocks all the ads on the websites I visit!

The settings are quite customizable and user friendly.The optimization for what is blocked on a page allows for precise targeting with great efficiency.

It does it's job. I watch Twitch stream and it blocks ads. I mean it may be bad for the streamer, but uh.. I get to watch 100% of the stream. 
This works with YouTube. 
I haven't tried Crunchyroll, because I use a different website to watch anime. I don't know if it'll work for hentai though.

-------------------------

Awesome!!! This is a MUST-HAVE extension.

I am an advanced user and have tried virtually every major ad and tracker blocker. 

Without hesitation, this is the best one for both blocking ads and trackers.

Whether you're an advanced or casual user, it gives you the amount of control that you want to take.  If a site is having problems because of blocked content, uBlock Origin makes it easy to fix it.

And if you mess up any of the settings, going back to default or unblocked is super easy.
-------------------------
block
The absolute best! It blocks ads and it's the least site-detectable of all rivals extensions! Don't take my word for it - add some adblock extensions and make a/b comparisons! The results will amaze you!

The greatest adblocker of all. Only complaint: the "strict tracking" blocks are a little on the annoying side, but the author's heart's in the right place.

The good
• I love it. It is owned and supported by a friendly community. Not a corporation. More secure because its code is publicly available for review and contributions on GitHub at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
• Easy to use. With both basic or advanced modes.
• Lightweight on memory and CPU resources
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome
• Clear Manifesto:
......• The user decides what web content is acceptable or not in their browser.
......• The uBlock project does not support Adblock Plus' "Acceptable Ads Manifesto", because the "Acceptable Ads" marketing campaign is really the business plan of a for-profit entity.
......• Users are best placed to know what is or is not acceptable to them. uBlock's sole purpose is to give users the means to enforce their own choices.
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome.
• Lots of features
• uBlock Origin has a better track record at fully protecting your privacy, than AdBlock Plus (ABP). There is a controversy around ABP and its related for profit corporation trying to monetize ABP via ad whitelisting. Which means that corporation sales your privacy for profit :( Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adblock_Plus#Controversy_over_ad_filtering_and_ad_whitelisting

The bad
• Confusion with the names. Between "uBlock Origin" and "uBlock". For those not familiar with those names, uBlock Origin is better than uBlock. Mostly because as of May 2017 Ublock Origin is still actively maintained and updated. Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin#uBlock_.28ublock.org.29uBlock Compare to uBlock which as not been maintained and updated for more than 2 years, since 2015, and is trying to monetize an open source project.

Skynet level efficiency, Terminator level blocking!

All with incredibly low system resource footprint- save power and free up your CPU cycles!

This is the ad-blocker you want!  
Best browser-level ad-block I've seen. Install and it works. With an additional 60 seconds you can configure it and subscribe to more known & maintained ad-network lists. On top of this, it's one-click-easy to backup & export your settings and subscriptions in case you need to import them to another PC.

If you aren't using this, walk away from your PC...

way overzealous adblocker, blocks EVERYTHING everywhere. It's like the chainsaw of adblockers, there is no subtlety it's everything everything in existence so no site ever works or nothing without individual tinkering. Annoying.

Oh, this is fantastic! In just three web pages, 35 ads were blocked, and the speed the web pages are loading is great! I use a lot of recipe pages, and they always have boatloads of ads.  My computer is not high-end, and low on RAM, so it's fast enough for pages without ads, but throw in those ads and things move at a snail's pace.  Thank you uBlock Origin/Raymond Hill for making this available.  Makes browsing so much better.

Literally the best ad blocker I have used. I tried a few, Got a new PC and didn't even bother with an ad blocker because sometimes they just didn't do anything. But this one is amazing blocks nearly if not all ads I have ran into :D Thanks for this! If you need a ad blocker download this!
-------------------------
block
The best adblocker on the market by far.

Very low memory footprint, properly block 95+% of ads, has custom ads blocking, UI is very intuitive if you need to activate ads for a specific website or change some settings.

What about AdBlock Plus? They are now selling whitelisting, so advertisers are paying to go through the adblocking. Screw that!

Thankfully uBlock Origin isn't doing any of that crap (so far), its record is 100% clean, perfect for me.

Right click any annoying element of a website even if it is not an ad, select "block element", select the wrapper html element  in the popup that shows up and enjoy the website without that SIGN UP HERE or whatever crap they are throwing at you!
-------------------------
block
BEST ad blocker...   MAKE SURE YOU ALSO INSTALL TAMPERMONKEY AND GET ANTI AD BLOCK KILLER
-------------------------
block
The best out there compared to the likes of ABP. Effective blocking of trackers. Plenty of customisation options for advanced users.
-------------------------
block
it's great at blocking ads BUT it recently started to NOT block ads that play on YouTube videos. That is not okay my people, i'm getting 1 minute ads with NO skip button! get it together! block that ads!
-------------------------
block
Best adblocker, blocks all ads, also very lightweight compared to adblock/adblock+
-------------------------
block
This blocks lots of pop-up, pop-unders and generally most annoying advertising.
-------------------------
block
What you need to do. is install Tampermonkey and an add on called ANTI AD BLOCK KILLER

it removes those 'please whitelist our site' pop ups
-------------------------
block
Based on what I've read about this, including recommendations from web anonymity and security researchers, I'm glad to have it. I switched from Adblock which worked well (not perfectly) and I'm already appreciating uBlock's features. However, I knew it was going to be perfect when I saw it was from the same developer as uMatrix, which allows blocking of elements of a website based on type (script, cookie, image…) and/or source domain, and also uses lists to block all elements from ad/malware domains. It by default blocks certain elements from all external domains, although all default rules are fully editable. Speed and flexibility of the visual interface to change site rules is notable. This 'matrix' also allows us to see what is going on on the webpage- how many X from domain Y being allowed/blocked. Both uBlock and uMatrix are strongly recommended though uBlock for *everyone* and uMatrix if you're a technophile and/or especially care about minimising your footprint online. uBlock is for everyone because I don't think anyone likes ads, especially these days when they are more aggressive, even on very respectable websites. The reduced memory use and marketer tracking are two other major reasons, if you're not convinced.
-------------------------
block
Brilliant! Flexible and effective solution to block ads and whatever annoys you.
-------------------------
block
This app is perfect! It blocks EVERYTHING unlike FairAds By Stands.
-------------------------
block
BEST ADD BLOCK. better than ad block pro and ad blocker.

Used ad block pro but some shady pop ups were still getting through. I have had NO issues after I started using uBlock Origin.
-------------------------
block
A very good extension. Does a very good job blocking ads and the author clearly has the users' privacy in mind with no intention of selling out.
-------------------------
block
Good news, they have a feature where you can manually block ads!
-------------------------
block
Blocks almost every ad
-------------------------
block
best add blocking app
-------------------------
block
The option to block specific elements manually really puts this ad blocker a step beyond all the others, I highly recommend it!
-------------------------
block
Does a pretty great job! On occasion it does block legitimate pop ups though.. such as when opening an extra window on a product you're shopping for. This is very rare tho. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
Better than AdBlock and other alternatives. This is the only one that blocks sneaky ads with auto generated id-s and other stuff. It seems that they do not take money for whitelisting ads which is great.
-------------------------
block
This is the best adblocker out there. Not only does it block ads, but it also protects you from phishing sites and sites that might give you malware.

It’s very easy on the CPU; it doesn’t slow down my browser in the slightest.

I recommend this extension to you if you:
• Are human
• Use the Internet
-------------------------
block
Excellent, but I'd love to have a simpler way to enable/disable all blocking globally, though.
-------------------------
block
good job,
data text base64 ads has been blocked
-------------------------
block
Its satisfying to block ads & prevent revenue from helping click bait sites & sites with talentless pseudo journalists like gizmodo.
-------------------------
block
Absolutely the best ad blocking extension out there for Google Chrome!
-------------------------
block
dear uBlock Origin team
i love your services
pls contenues services always provide by your side this is very difficult bcoz your team block many company add but you great i am with you best team tnx for this master blaster app i see result 
tnx regard sanjay
-------------------------
block
Best ad blocking extension you can get.
-------------------------
block
Previously used AdGuard: this is marginally better performance-wise, but being open-source, without ulterior agenda, and both in addition to the core functions, makes this product the best available (at this time).

The Block Element feature could be improved but I haven't really needed to use it.
-------------------------
block
THE BEST option for ad blocking ever! I've tried them all folks...nothing beats this, especially the built-in sync feature. Something that is lacking in every other Chrome ad blocker!
-------------------------
block
I have loved this extension for a really long time. Used to use Adblocker but this one is even easier to disable and enable, plus it seems to be more intuitive when blocking spam popups. <3
-------------------------
block
UBlock Origin is currently the best overall set-it-and-forget-it ad blocker/general-purpose blocker browser extension with the lowest RAM and CPU usage in my opinion, and it is the only one that I have used so far that can block most annoying pop-up ads.

Keep up the good work,
-John Jr
-------------------------
block
Blocks many ads and even blocks some ads that may be harmful. A great extension for Chrome for the ad-haters out there.
-------------------------
block
is gud, it blocks
-------------------------
block
Just a request for the dev. This ad blocker is not working well with vipbox - a streaming website. There are still way too many ads and popups on that site. In the past, this extension was working well on vipbox but now all the ads and popups are coming up again. These streaming websites are infested with all sorts of malicious ads and popups and a working ad block would be really helpful. Thanks.
-------------------------
block
Best ad block ever! with less ram usage of course :p
-------------------------
block
The best there is, esp. the advanced setting + logging. 
Make manual blocking of certain stuff, also stuff like anti-adblocker scripts, a lot easier.
Combined with uMatrix a real power house.
-------------------------
block
This is a great addon it not only blocks annoying ads and popups it blocks redirects on websites to malicious content. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
awesome, blocks all the annoying ads
-------------------------
block
I didn't know about blocking to ad. Suddenly my one of the friends recommended this extension, I swear this extension is freaking good! U guys can enjoy about no more ad!!
-------------------------
block
blocks everything!!!!
-------------------------
block
This thing is amazing! I'm so used to it now, so I don't notice how good it is until I use someone else's device and I realize just how many things it has blocked for me, and if you need it to be disabled, piece of cake. A couple of clicks, and it's fine. 10/10. (Or 5/5 I guess :)
-------------------------
block
It simply blocks more of the ads I encounter than popular competitors I've used.
-------------------------
block
Blocks ALL ads. Much better than ABP!
-------------------------
block
Ad Blocker is clunky, the amount of times I've had slow loading of pages with "waiting for ad blocker" at the bottom and then I noticed it wasn't dealing with pop ups and letting YouTube ads through so I wondered what the point of it was.  Someone mentioned this on a friend's facebook thread so I went for it and I've never looked back.  It's pretty cool, no need to know lots of scripting and you can block certain parts of a page as well.  It's also great with shutting down those annoying new tab ads that certain sites have started doing now.
-------------------------
block
Best Adblocker ever. It blocks the ads other ones don't. Finally an adblocker that really works. Kudos..

PS: Hey Stephen Murad, do you have it turned om? lol
-------------------------
block
Possibly the best ad blocking extension there is for Web Browsers.
-------------------------
block
Works well to block ads while not slowing down browsing.
-------------------------
block
Блокирует рекламу больше чем add block. Я довольна. Спасибо разработчикам ))
-------------------------
block
Very useful! It blocks YouTube ads, deceptive sites, and much more than AdBlock or other adblockers would! Open source. Highly, highly recommended!
-------------------------
block
great better than add block plus
-------------------------
block
finally, i had to learn how to use the various filters but in 5 to 10 min i finally got to view a site i love with out 50 pop ups blocking the view and love the "cosmetics" setting, thx soo much. 
to quote rick and morty:
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!!!
Ublock presented...
I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT!
GOOD JOB!!!
-------------------------
block
Outstanding software!  My trusty Ad-Block Plus was starting to get blocked on various sites.  I upgraded to this and it works flawlessly.  It also seems to have a much lighter footprint.
-------------------------
block
Love Media contents blocking ...Thank you
-------------------------
block
Please block ads on www.voot.com & www.hotstart.com

as well. These are Indian TV streaming websites. They load ads dynamically from there server.

Don't know how you guys might go around blocking but seriously if you guys do.....its a great achievement
-------------------------
block
FINALLY! I was constantly being tormented by mgid.com ads (sponsored content, fraught with malware and new tab ads). This is the first blocker that is able to filter their connections.

I literally love you.

[EDIT]
I did some testing to see to what extent it could block things, it also manages to close the connection of my nemesis: The invisible "click here and a new tab opens up telling you to trade binary options" ad.

HOW DO I PAY YOU FOR THIS
-------------------------
block
This is the best one I ever tried, adblock, adblock plus is hell, they dont block any ads and Browser so fast without adblock and  ublock dosen't need any memory.
-------------------------
block
"Adds by mgid" was messing with some site functions, it was blocking buttons. None of the malware software could deal with it, but ublock did it. The pages work as they were intended. I`m very impressed. Thank You very much. Very impressive work!
-------------------------
block
Taking over from Adblock Plus as the torchbearer in making the web somewhat saner.

It could be slightly better at allowing me to pick a background image to block.
-------------------------
block
Adblock+ was no longer effective in blocking ad.

Did search via google and uBlock Origin was very effective in blocking ads with minimal tweaking (if any) from user.  

I installed on my iMac desktop and immediately ads that Adblock+ allowed went poof!
-------------------------
block
Easy on the memory and blocks all adds. Lightweight extension.
-------------------------
block
excellent blocks everything in its range 

and ill tell you why

memory efficient low consumption rate
-------------------------
block
Since Adblock sold out, this is the best blocker I've seen (should have changed to this ages ago).

I've been using this for a while now and it's much better, blocks more efficiently annoying ads and performance is quite nice.

Extensive filter lists to choose from (defaults are fine without any addition).
Plus also same (and extended) "own filtering" as Adblock, which you can import.
-------------------------
block
Adblock betrayed me by giving me the ads that I wanted to remove. uBlock blocked them out right away without a hassle with much less memory space. I highly recommend it.
-------------------------
block
The best adblocker by far. Lightweight and blocks all ads (not sellout like Adblock Plus which shows acceptable ads). Plus you can whitelist any site very easily. However best thing is the speed, it's consumes very little memory. Good job developers!
-------------------------
protect
Protects against malicious .JS attacks in default mode.
-------------------------
block
This is the best adblocker i have tried so far, it seems to be blocking all ads and its light on system usage and a bonus is it blocks some ad urls as well! definitely recommend getting this over any adblockers out there
-------------------------
block
Perfect, Install and press the power button and Ads are blocked just like that.
-------------------------
block
It's great! blocks every ads now
-------------------------
block
I went onto the most-ad-of-all-time website and Ublock blocked them all. That's nice because it makes my computer run super fast compared to if there were ads
-------------------------
block
Great!

Open source!

Way better than AdBlock plus.

Love the little details. The little number of items blocked. and the clean pop down with more details.
-------------------------
block
It is a nice adblocker, I used to have adblock plus and they now SELL ADS exclusive to their users, therefore using them to milk out revenue. This adblocker is actually honest and isn't like abp. It is a adblocker but with way more features. it dosen't only block ads, but it blocks malware and tracking aswell.
-------------------------
block
I wish it were easier to pick out elements that you DO want allowed, for example navigation buttons on certain sites are blocked when they're perfectly innocent, otherwise this is a great extension.
-------------------------
block
Good ad block!
-------------------------
block
The best ad-blocking software. Easily modified in the options, with lots of custom blocking lists than can be used together.

Also didn't sell out like AdBlockPlus.
-------------------------
block
This much much much better than ABP that has recently started selling ads. It blocks most of the ads and the desired page loads a lot faster without the adblocker
-------------------------
block
blocks ads!
-------------------------
block
It works. It's light weight.

Summary- much better than Ad Block Plus.
-------------------------
protect
Currently the best content blocker around. Makes sites very much faster to load and protects your privacy. Very customizable and open source which is a plus.
-------------------------
block
block all
-------------------------
block
This extension is great. It blocks ads silently and I don't have to worry about ads anymore.

Croatian:
Ovo proširenje je izvrsno. Blokira reklame tiho u pozadini i ne moram više brinuti o njima.
-------------------------
block
An all-round excellent ad-blocker that still struggles with some very ad-heavy sites, and can be a little heavy-handed with the script blocking at times.
-------------------------
block
Originally got AdBlock+ because I wanted it to block ads. Since they want to play the oxymoron game, I got this instead, works like a charm.
-------------------------
block
Much better than other blocking solutions such as AdBlock, AdBlock+ (whitelisted some ads because money) et.c
-------------------------
block
It is the best. Open source and with advanced user mode, you can block scripts and other trackers. Plus it has a nice list of extra filters to choose from. Way better than ABP, which whitelists many ads from big companies, like Google and Microsoft
-------------------------
block
Block YouTube ads, scrubs!
-------------------------
block
Blocks everything! love it
-------------------------
block
I used ADP for a long time but Facebook has recently taken measures to make ad blockers not work (August 2016). I decided to try uBlock and it worked to block the Facebook ads! 100% pleased with this extension. It did exactly what I wanted it to do. Thank you!
-------------------------
block
Best !
I have used all ad blockers and even some paid ones but  one thing it is best at is low on system resources and best on blocking ads.
Thank you for this app.
-------------------------
block
The best ad blocking extension out there. ABP < AB < uBlock Origin
-------------------------
block
It's like NBA game, and you blocks enemies' attacks all the time!
-------------------------
block
Ad Block Plus was failing me lately, and I saw this suggested on reddit, thank you!
-------------------------
block
Best out there, but help feels like a developer with no people skills.  The best walkthroughs are NOT by the developer.

  Left is global, Right is per current site.  Green/Red is allow/deny and Gray is allow unless explicitly denied from a filter(rule).... like allow unless my adblock list blocks something from a */advertisement/* type filter. 

uMatrix is the super-advanced version, with even worse documentation... not worth the extra effort, but uBlock rocks.  Make sure you use the Origin version.
-------------------------
block
Absolutely blocks all ads, and makes it easier to surf the web!
-------------------------
protect
Easy on cpu and RAM. Publishers don't do anything fishy. Comes with great web filters that protect your computer. I recommend it to anyone who asks.
-------------------------
block
I have tested all the ad block extensions memory usage, and this one considerable consumes less memory (about 45mb). So its my pick. Thanks!
-------------------------
block
very good extension for blocking
-------------------------
block
better and blocks more than ads, also scripts etc
-------------------------
block
amazing
100 times beter and stronger than ad block and ADP 

and make pages load much much more faster without leaking local IP

love you !

release new version and make it even beter $$
BOOM
-------------------------
block
Switched from Adblock Plus which was a bigtime resource hog. uBlock Origin is much better. It is a resource-efficient, feature-rich and user-friendly ad blocker and privacy extension. I also disabled Disconnect since uBlock Origin has the ability to enable the same features Disconnect offers via blocking lists by Disconnect. I can now enjoy opening tabs again without much worrying about slowdowns. Not as stylish as Adblock Plus, but it does a better job. Cloud storage synchronization is also a cool feature.
-------------------------
block
The only popup blocker that I've tried that actually blocks popups. Thank you!
-------------------------
detect
uBlock Origin helped me detect a rogue extension Imgur Uploader that was redirecting my clicked links to cityadspix.

Thanks and keep up the good work Mr gorhill.
-------------------------
block
Slim down all the crap your browser is told to download by the sites you're visiting. Great for users more comfortable tweaking settings as well as those who just want a cleaner surfing experience. 

For those in the latter category: be prepared for more interaction with your browser as you may find videos, images, comment sections, etc., not loading like you're accustomed to. 

Once you learn the ad block way, you can never go back. 

Want to support sites by allowing ads? Whitelist them.
-------------------------
block
Excellent. Could benefit from cookie blocking rules.
-------------------------
block
Not on my computer.  Which browser do you use?  I know it doesn't work well with UC Browser for PC because they have their own built in ad blocker.  But it works perfectly in Chrome, Firefox and Opera.  It blocks every ad in my browsers. It's 110x's better than ABP which was once my favorite.
-------------------------
block
really love this feature "Block media elements larger than"
-------------------------
block
Best content blocking extension on the planet.
-------------------------
detect
really awsome. my old adblocker was detected by sites this one dosent. love it
-------------------------
block
Its Light Weight and Can Block Approx. all Ads.
Thanks
-------------------------
block
Really like it. The best I have found. What I really like is that you CAN block individual elements of a whitelisted site. 

I actually don't like to take away someone's bread and butter by blocking the ads. So I was looking for a filter to protect me from spyware and malware which they all do but I also wanted a way to block individual horrendously annoying elements easily which this does pretty well. The others don't let you do anything on a whitelisted site. This one does. This is important to me because I actually whitelist most sites.

Actually, I just tried it on a site, just on a large ad in the top right block. When you ad the filter it disappears, but each refresh brings another one back. 

I will still stick with this though. Out of 7 I tried, only one comes close to this. 

Maybe I really don't even need this though because I do not go to any "questionable" sites. It is comforting for first time visits.

Thank you for this fine piece of software.
-------------------------
block
good block
-------------------------
block
After trying adblocker and adblocker plus etc. I can tell you this one blows the rest out of the water. Literally blocks everything. While adblocker let an ad through once in awhile. I would highly recommend this to everyone.
-------------------------
block
Works great! Other ad blockers will still show ads on some websites and other stuff like that. But uBlock Origin blocks all ads. If you want to get rid of ads I HIGHLY recommend this.
-------------------------
block
This is probably the most flexible adblocking software I've ever used. Not only does it easily bypass adblock killers and allow you to pick elements to block, but it also has an extensive, fully customizable filter list. Overall, it's my personal favorite.
-------------------------
block
Great blocks everything while still being able to view sites
-------------------------
block
this is just great! i pirate games and the sites have popups every time you click but with ublock origin, you can completely block them out. i've never seen an ad block this good
-------------------------
block
So far the best blocker I've ever used...and I used them ALL!  Pretty easy to understand.  Allows changes and exceptions. Disable pre-fetching (to prevent any connection for blocked network requests) Disable hyperlink auditing/beacon
Prevent WebRTC from leaking local IP addresses. Sweeeet :)
-------------------------
bypass
so far no issues, able to bypass forbes anti adblock
-------------------------
block
Its Good working.
Best ad-blocker. Extremely efficient and blocks everything
-------------------------
block
best adblocker. blocks everything
-------------------------
block
Best ad-blocker. Extremely efficient and blocks everything. Way better than the classic Adblock.
The best thing about this extension is that it still closes the popups if it failed to prevent them from opening! Keep it up.
-------------------------
block
Definitely better than AD Block ... I recommend it
-------------------------
block
Blocking too much on USAToday.com . I hope this can get fixed soon.

But I love it. Everyone should use it.
-------------------------
block
Ever since switching to this ad block I've been so much happier browsing the web.
-------------------------
block
absolutely amazing. i dont know how i was able to browse the internet before. all ads are blocked, and nothing else. even youtube and crunchyroll ads!
-------------------------
block
The Best Ad Blocking Extension Better than the Original.
-------------------------
block
This ad blocker works better than any others I've tried. It blocks pop ups and pesky ads with ease. 5/7, perfect app.
-------------------------
block
> If for example you block a page element and that same element is shown again in multiple locations on the webpage or domain. This really needs to be able to block all similar items or block parent items across similar pages or entire domains.

The element picker tells you you can use <Ctrl>-click: this will effectively select all similar elements on the page.

It also offers you the all the parent elements of the element you clicked, it's just a matter of clicking on an entry other than the first one in the list to select one of the parent element.
-------------------------
block
Almost used every blocker but no one has the ability to block the adds. Randomly I found uBlock, this is One of the Best and most efficient ADD Blocker..
Say Bbye to other Add blockers and Use uBloack.
-------------------------
prevent
This app has worked great to prevent ads from popping up since I have been using it.  You can select an ad that does pop up and prevent it from happening again.
-------------------------
block
great app for blocking ads and more!
-------------------------
block
The best blocker out there! Blocks both ads and trackers, also it's easy on the RAM.
-------------------------
block
Love being able to block entire elements like sidebars filled with advertisements. This is also much less memory intensive than Adblock or Adblock Plus.
-------------------------
block
Blocks taboola ads! Thank you. They are the worst ads out there - but allowed in adblock plus...
-------------------------
block
Keep up the good work, guys! This works far better than ADB+ ever did, and blocks essentially nothing that's not an ad. Cheers.
-------------------------
block
This extension is so much more than a simple AD Blocking add-on. 

- AdBlock Plus now lets through a lot of ads. You can get around that, but if you actually donated that doesn't unwound your psyche. 
- uBlock Origin does. uBlock Origin is the new warm blanket of intrusive Internet avoidance.
-------------------------
block
Definitely, I wrote this back before I even discovered the advanced dynamic filtering, which allows me to have on-the-fly customization of how web-content is blocked. (Eg: If a certain list/global rule blocks some element/web-script you need, then set a local rule to white list it for that particular website.) Nice how they added protocol blocking as well.
-------------------------
block
Ethics aside, this isn't an "ad blocker" but a comprehensive "content blocker" (gorhill's words, not mine. See his GitHub repo.) It can do a whole lot more than block ads.
-------------------------
block
Does exactly what it says on the tin and does it well. Blocks ads/tracking elements reliably without interrupting other site content, integrates with the standard adblock filter formats used in other adblock extensions, provides an easy interface to custom-pick elements to create custom blocking rules without even needing to know the adblock script syntax. A must-have piece of the puzzle for convenience, privacy, and security concerns.

Also it was recommended by Taylor Swift on Twitter.
-------------------------
block
Best when it blocks all the advs screwing my live streaming of football matches. Thanks
-------------------------
block
it does what I want it to, I also find it easy to add new content to the block lists.
-------------------------
block
Love this extension, would be lost without him!
(especially element block)
-------------------------
prevent
best adblocker i've ever seen, and preventing to open malware site :)
-------------------------
block
- A frontline and essential part of my computer security preventing malware via rogue adverts.
- Makes sites that use third party advert services usable.
- Useful element blocking for removing invasive non-advert elements such as autoplay videos, fixed social-media buttons or newsletter sign-up popups.
-------------------------
block
This addin give you more than just an add blocker - advanced users can control / block many aspects of the browser interaction.
-------------------------
block
Great App does it job perfectly. Only question I have is can I use the uBlock filters(So those from the uBlock github) as well in another ad block program?
-------------------------
block
The best ad blocking extension available at the moment, much smaller memory footprint than other's I've tried and much more customisable if you want that.
-------------------------
block
FINALLY! hahaha this is actually the most decent blocker that I have encountered lol It tried to block all of the pop up ads that I have been getting.. I just hope for you to continue this consistency :) thankss
-------------------------
block
Blocks ads well (I rarely if ever see any now), and does so with good performance.
-------------------------
block
Trust me I have tried them all on every different platform and browser. uBlock Origin not only does a better job at blocking ads than all others, but also uses far less system resources than the likes of adblock plus etc.. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
-------------------------
block
Absolutely brilliant, so many lists to choose from, better than ABP.  Can't recommend highly enough. Temporary unblocking is brilliant if you're online shopping etc.

Only missing feature is that you can't see exactly what has been blocked and what is allowed but if you turn advanced mode on you get some way towards showing this.
-------------------------
block
The logger:
uBlock Origin comes with a logger, which gives the ability to inspect what uBlock is doing with network requests and DOM elements, whether something is blocked or allowed, and which filter, if any, matched a network request or DOM element
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger
-------------------------
block
Better than all other adblockers I've tried.  uBlock Origin does the job perfectly and uses so little resources, you don't notice it being there.  It also starts up much faster in Chrome compared to the other popular adblockers.  Very rarely needs turning off, as 99.9% of sites work absolutely fine with it.  uBlock Origin also enhances privacy (not just by blocking ads), so another good reason to add it to Chrome.
-------------------------
protect
Both Adblock and Adblock plus have recently failed for me.

This software restores full protection from having my bandwidth hijacked for ads and other purposes that I both don't want and don't authorize.

The others are sellouts.
This open source. This is the real deal and closest to Noscript for chrome.

"Free.

very good at blocking annoying ads
-------------------------
detect
This is the most aggressive ad blocker I've used. Too aggressive to recommend to non-tech users but good for those that know their way around detecting if an ad blocker is causing problems.
-------------------------
block
Blocks everything and I like the owner better than the other ones.
-------------------------
block
Best Ad blocking software I've used for Chrome.
-------------------------
block
This is way better than AdBlock since it has no conflict of interest & would block ALL ads. Thank you so much for developing this.
-------------------------
block
By far the absolute best ad blocker on any market. AdBlockPlus failed for years and had a clunky interface compared to uBlock Origin. Get this Ad Blocker because it really works! Works so good I can't say enough good things about it. Try it and find out for yourself. By default it adds a few good repositories but you can add more and they've done the work for you to, just check the ones you need added and Apply changes. Also comes with a eye dropper to block anything on screen. That was always an extension to AdBlockPlus. uBlock Origin all the way!
-------------------------
block
Was skeptical... but this is an excellent program. I thoroughly tested it with Youtube, and ya'al can get rid of Adblock for Youtube... if you guys even use it because this blocks those too! Thanks!
-------------------------
block
I heard that uBlock Origin was less resource hungry than other adblock plug-ins, so I gave it a try. Wow, it completely blew me away. It effectively blocked out all kinds of ads. Even Pandora ads are blocked. The other plug-ins don't do that. I love it so much that I installed it on all my browsers.
-------------------------
protect
3rd party lists add an additional layer of well needed protection
-------------------------
block
Lightweight, fast and blocks all the ads. The best adblocker So far.
-------------------------
block
Much better than Adblock and Adblock plus. This actually blocks ads.
-------------------------
block
Managed to block some frames that AdBlock could not. Cudos!
-------------------------
block
Does what adblock doesn't.... it blocks ALL ads
-------------------------
block
Screw Adblock who got sold out. This one has more customisation and blocks every ads just as it's supposed to!
-------------------------
block
This adblocker is the best. People talking about Ad Blocker plus etc. They need to checkout ublock origin. This app is easy on your CPU. I did a side by side by having Adblock plus along side ublock origins to see the number of ads that are blocked. Ublock origins shows more numbers of ads blocked than adblocker plus. Get this now.
-------------------------
block
Very useful for blocking unwanted tracking and speeding up page loads by disabling tons of scripts from attempting to download and run code.

UPDATE: 3 stars because I have to enable it every time I start it up. Also, Twitch ads have started to slip through so that's pretty annoying.

Works extremely well and is very light on resources. I'm constantly impressed with ease of functionality and it's effectiveness in identifying and blocking not only ads but also malicious sites as well.
-------------------------
block
Does exactly what you want it too, blocks ads, no more, no less. Spot on.

I find that this is currently the best ad blocker that I have used in Chrome. It blocks all of the ads for me in YOU-TUBE, which has proved useful when watching some of the longer documentary videos in there, and I find I have no problems with ads in Websites. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
block
great adblocker. how do i disable blocking on youtube though?
-------------------------
block
Excellent utility. With proper adblock lists. Blocks out bad stuff.
-------------------------
block
Small and very fast.

The request grid feature is great to fine-tune blocked requests
-------------------------
block
Great adblock extension. My favorite feature is the toggling of certain filtering/blocking (i.e. cosmetic filtering, strict blocking, etc.) It makes it really helpful on sites that say turn off your adblock. Most of the time I toggle the cosmetic blocking and it doesn't even recognize the extension. Plus, it has a ton of filter lists to boot so it's my favorite and I've tried all of them.

loved it good add blocking

best adds block ihave tried,, keep devoloping

Best blocker out there. Fixed issues they used to have with playwire videos. Much better than the competition at block individual elements

After AdBlockPlus sold its soul to allow Taboola ads and other content to bypass filters, I needed a new solution.  uBlock Origin delivers as promised.  Good Bye, Taboola and the rest of your similar garbage.
-------------------------
protect
Read the explanation for the new permissions before rating. They are actually very well justified and giving the extra protection that was missing before.
-------------------------

Great problem. Does everything I need to block unwanted ads or pop ups. 

I was a little concerned about the new permissions until I read what they were and why they were needed.

This is a great program and I highly recommend it. :)
-------------------------

perfect! blocks everything and easy on CPU. 
there are alot of fake "uBlock" now but this is the original.
-------------------------

Awesome add blocker. Blocked over 500 ads over the course of 4 hours. Beautiful.
-------------------------
protect
An excellent blocker that adds lots of extra protection with minimal intervention required.
-------------------------
block
Super user tool for all users. Should really be called "block all the unwanted, crappy website annoyances that pop up while you are browsing tool". I would even rate it higher. :)
-------------------------
block
it really helpful and i think its best way to block
-------------------------
block
Long-time Adblock user.

Installed this, and instantly noticed an difference in speed.

And it blocks everything and anything I'd need it to, just as much as Adblock or Adblock Plus have done for me in the past.

Props to gorhill, good work!
-------------------------

Simple, and easy to use. Light on CPU usage, blocks ads like a charm, includes Block Element feature for other obtrusive elements if you need it. Perfect as is.

Who would have thought that I fall in love with ad block extension ;)

This is the best ad blocking plugin available. Low memory usage and does what it is supposed to, without a bunch of extra popups or clutter. I wouldn't browse without it.
-------------------------

Fastest ad blocking extension out there. I'm amazed that at the same settings as competition, my Chrome is performing noticeably faster.
-------------------------
block
Blocks better than Adblock. Very fast.
-------------------------
block
I could not uninstall ABP quick enough after reading about its paid acceptable ads campaign.  This uBlock works much better.  It blocks more stuff, its faster, and takes up less memory.  Oh and its open source to boot so you can see what its doing if you are so inclined.
-------------------------
block
The only extension I've reviewed. As soon as I saw that it could block page elements and REMEMBER them, I knew I had to leave a positive review. Much better on Memory than ABP. So glad I found this extension because it's easily my favorite. Now I don't have to see the stupid facebook chat I never use! :D
-------------------------
block
Works great, but I do have to agree with Connor W. who stated that it blocked things on Google Translate. It supposedly blocked about 15 ads as I translated a work and clicked on the "Listen" button. Other than that, it seems to work really well.
-------------------------
block
Excellent both for novice and for power users (the dynamic blocking popup as well as inspector are purely awesome). Also very impressive research behind performance and blocking.
-------------------------
block
Much better than ABP, however, it does tend to block a bit too much. It would be nice if it was easier to block individual page elements like you can in ABP. 

Like, for instance, when on certain video sites, it manages to block the ads, but it also blocks some content. And therefore I can't turn it off because I'd lose the adblocking, but I'm also losing some content. 

But either way, it is still infinitely better than ABP. Thanks for creating this!
-------------------------
block
It's pretty good ad block!
Thanx!
-------------------------
block
Very good addon, excellent! It blocks all adds and use keeps very low RAM memory usage when compared to old AddBlock addon. Very good this one is also OpenSource on github!
-------------------------
block
It can do exaclty what i needed: block a single url from downloading.
-------------------------
block
Fantastic adblock, easily the best, ever! It is VERY light weight, extremely customization with a ton of pre-configured block lists with support for your own, and specific element blocking. It's open source, with great documentation on GitHub! By far my favorite chrome/chromium extension, and I will continue to use it until the end of time.
-------------------------
block
Top marks for this ad blocking app, it really is the best in it's class. I would advise all Adblock(+) users to install µBlock immediately. You'll notice that pages load like the speed of lightning as its far more efficient and doesn't require dumping 20megs of css rules into the DOM for every page and iframe :)
-------------------------
block
This is very good and blocks all ads!
-------------------------
block
Love how it block the ads. Not only that it's not a memory hag extension unlike the other extension that I have tried. 5*
-------------------------
block
My first AD blocker recommended by a friend which works great.  I even tried out the URL posted in David Mason's comment that uBlock blocked 3 ADs at this site so I am pleased with it.
-------------------------
block
ive tried like ten different adblockers and this one works the best it pre blocks tons of ads and u dont have to do it manually
-------------------------
block
This is pretty comprehensive protection, blocking more than any single protection extension in Google's Catalog right out of the box. Tweaking it is surprisingly easy and I've never had a single issue with it breaking a website to date.
-------------------------
block
Its fantastic. Uses less memory that Adblock and ABP whilst being as functional as both blockers. It does need better pop-up blocking though, so far so good
-------------------------
block
Would be really usefull to have "Pause all blocking" (or similar) button
-------------------------
block
I love it. Works well and easy on memory. 

One thing I would like to see is the blacklist feature. I would love to have an abbility to only block web pages that are filled with ads.
-------------------------
block
Good twitter and FB plugin to be blocked too
-------------------------
block
Fast but overly zealous blocker. Blocks much more than ads, like Google Analytics, Google and Facebook-based single sign-ons, etc.

I just want an ad blocker.
-------------------------
block
Half the mem usage of ABP. Been an avid ABP for 10 years... but going to uBlock! Better blocking and no need for Ghostery either.
-------------------------
block
Excellent! I don't notice the efficiency (I've got plenty of power to spare) difference, but why waste by using other services?

It's really simple to block specific elements, too, which is great. Easier to do so on µBlock than it is on Adblock, I'd say.
-------------------------
block
This is a very good blocker that needs refinement. It blocks too many non-ad fields, such as blanks to enter passwords and usernames. This app could be the best with tweaks, but AdBlock Plus remains the reference standard.
-------------------------
block
Really good! Seems to have increased my browsing speeds compared to AdBlock Plus. Also blocks all Ads which is awesome as well.
-------------------------
block
Very impressed so far. I didn't have many slowdown issues with Adblock (Adblock Plus was really problematic for me, plus sellout-concerns), but the ones I had this fixed.

I'm not quite sure I am on board with the default loadout of blocks, because I also run Ghostery and I suspect the privacy-related stuff is superfluous as a result. Still, a very good extension and heartily recommended.
-------------------------
block
I'm impressed at how well this works compared to Adblock/Adblock Plus. I'd just like to see the addition of whitelisting website and blocking elements manually.
-------------------------
block
Already works well and blocks ads/elements before page load (i.e, faster, more secure). Keep up the great work and looking forward to completed product.
-------------------------
block
gorhill is known for developing both µBlock and the more powerful HTTP Switchboard extensions. µBlock is more lightweight than its spiritual predecessor, featuring reliable blocking with minimal memory use. In its current state, µBlock trumps alternatives in terms of UI, out-of-box list selection, and even performance, making it a clear all-around choice for users who desire sleek ad-blocking software.

Go to the Costco site by entering the URL in the address bar. If it blocks it do the following while still on that page... Just find the extension icon for Ublock Origin (on Chrome its under the puzzle looking piece unless you pinned it) LEFT Click on it Press the BIG Blue Power Button Now Click the Refresh Symbol that just appeared to the right of the Blue Power Button! If you are being redirected to sites it may block the site... Again you can turn off Ublock Origin from any site by doing what I described above. This is the best blocker out there! Its really easy to use, you will learn! Its Easy!

Dear developers, Nowadays website layouts are optimized to display ads and teasers. I use "block element" for each unwanted element in header/footer/side panels. End result - huge empty margins. This is much better than ads, but can still be improved. Desired features for "preview/bock/pick/quit" panel: * Add button "Only show selected" that hides everything BUT selected and sets margins/padding of outer containers to zero. Use case: select the only relevant pane in one click and maximize the pane. * Add controls to toggle "show/hide/highlight" and to unblock unblock elements affected by user defined filters. Use case: restore accidentally blocked element.

1. add button "undo recently added block rule". This is useful in case we didn't set a good rule after all, as it might have ruined the website a bit 2. Show visual list of what was blocked, to be able to unblock what we actually want This is useful even for cases that the default blocker has done bad things to how the website work. 3. Ability to reset all settings of current website. 4. report a website has bad behavior after using default blocking rules. This can help with others who might visit it.

Dear gorhill, I'm a long time user of your extension and I really admire and appreciate your work on uBlock. The things I like the most about uBlock over other extensions are its performance, low memory usage and extensions to the EasyList grammar which makes it really powerful especially for blocking anti-adblock contents. Currently you are including some of your rules and replacement contents namely resources.txt, filters.txt and badware.txt as static assets as part of your extension itself. Since the replacement resources in resources.txt are highly effective in dealing with anti-adblock scripts, I'm wondering if you are willing to host them as part of other crowd-sourced filters like EasyList so that the community can contribute more replacement scripts for anti-adblock detection scripts and it could potentially be used by other extensions as well. Please let me know your thoughts on this suggestion. Thanks, K'vel

uBlock Origin can block ads in Pandora, and Spotify Web flawlessly. It used to do the same with Google Play Music radio stations. That's not the case anymore, Google found the way to bypass uBlock Origin. If would be awesome if you fixed this. Thanks! I love this extension!

EasyList without element hiding rules 4. EasyPrivacy 5. Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List 6. Fanboy’s Annoyance List 7. Fanboy’s Social Blocking List B. Are there any other list included by Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List then the above 7 lists? C.

Thank you very much for your replay BilBg, Great respect for your wonderful work regardin uBlock Origin. I don't have to post here the lists witch are not checked, because those ones show "0 used of XXXX" too. These are the "0 used of XXXX" checked lists: 1. Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List (forums.lanik.us): 0 used out of 909 2. Fanboy’s Social Blocking List (forums.lanik.us): 0 used out of 12,864 But tell me please, if i will use Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List I can uncheck all those above 7 lists from the first post? Is it a good idea, considering: 1.hardware resources used by loading the lists 2.how often is Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List updated compared with the 7 lists? 3. Number of lines included in Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List compared with the 7 lists. Many appreciations for you excellent work with the uBlock Origin. Warm regards.

Hi, My apologies if this question/topic has already been disused, I've tried to find, but I couldn't. Please answer to the next three questions. I will number them to be easier for you to answer: 1. Referring to used hardware resources (CPU) which of the above two alternatives is better to use: -All Fanboy lists + All EasyLists OR - Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List 2. Referring to number of blocking lines which alternative of the two ones is more often updated and have more blocked lines? -All Fanboy lists + All EasyLists OR -Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List ? 3. Is it better to use both of the two alternatives regarding the first two questions? Thank you very much.

As a frequent internet user, it is hard to not get ads shoved down your throat. The uBlock Origin extension is like a force field protecting me from intrusive ads and annoying elements of webpages. It makes browsing Fandom wikis and other websites with 100 septillion ads a whole lot easier. It is also helpful for blocking websites; as a matter of fact, I use it to block embedded TikTok videos and the TikTok site itself (so the CCP spies can't get me). So all in all, uBlock Origin is worth the download.

It's not perfect, it's best to have a backup adblocker but there's a reason I've kept this one for many years while the backup often changes. This is the toughest most reliable adblocker I've ever had, too tough for some as it can break some websites. It might not always catch all the ads but the manual blocking tool works great and the ads stay blocked. This extention with a supplementary kinder adblocker for those sites that can't take it has made being on the internet so much easier and less annoying

Does anyone else deal with the blocker blocking the screens that pop up on YouTube when trying to unsubscribe or add something to a playlist? I would just disable the blocker but I also use it as my main ad blocker for YouTube. And if anyone has any ideas on how to fix that'd be cool. Love this blocker though, really good for getting into websites that either want an account or just have hundreds of popups.

It does what is says, it is a ad-blocker and it it amazing for low-end computers! No ads or pop-ups about how many ads you blocked, it just gets blocked!

It works perfectly! It's heavily customizable and very versatile as not just an adblocker, but also a tool to hide various annoying prompts, like cookie prompts and newsletter signups.

Best adblocker available to download. If this ever goes paid I will absolutely buy it.

Quite literally essential when browsing the internet. There are so many intrusive, distracting, obstructive and just annoying ads nowadays, you can't go without a solid adblocker, and this one is the solid-est of them all.

Also works with annoying UI elements on websites that don't contribute to anything and just waste space, like most of the fandom wiki website.

You can even block entire websites from appearing at all! You can even block the little recommendation bar that appears when you pause a youtube video on a third-party website

Never got an ad ever in YouTube for a year now and I'm surprised and it works perfectly fine. It blocks every ads but there are some ads that still displays if you go into a sussy website but I don't rlly mind since it's on the side but it blocks annoying ads that are like fake messages, redirect popups suspicious links, popups, etc. This is the best adblock extension in my opinion.

The plugin works incredibly well, it completely blocks advertisements, tracking cookies like the little facebook icon, and all of the pop-ups that appear. Unlike some Adblocker programs, uBlock doesnt make exceptions to advertisements unless you specify (other adblockers allow advertisers to pay extra to allow their ads through the blocker). I have never had a problem with uBlock, there is no nonsense about it and it has a large team of people working on it. Since it's open-source, the entire program is public to read, so it is almost undoubtedly safe

I find this to be the most reliable and easy to use of ad-blockers. No nonsense, and it really does a great job of blocking malicious websites and pop-ups. If anything it's too effective sometimes.

This is actually so good, just need to right click on what I wanted to delete and highlight it and boom gone permanently and if I needed to get a part back, I can just go into the my filters and delete it from there and I learned all this just a few minutes ago when this post was made, so I highly recommend anyone who has that annoying feature on their favourite site or for any ads (which this does automatically), this is very good indeed. (Edit): When it stopped blocking ads I just reinstalled and that did the job, until they update that's probably the way to fix the issue. And you can import anything you want removed.

This is an adblocker I have been using for about 3 weeks now, and I just have to say that I love it. It's amazing, and works just fine for me. When I go to sites to watch dramas, they usually have a lot of pop-up ads. With this extension, it doesn't happen anymore. Same for youtube. I don't have to deal wit ads there anymore! There's also another website that I use to watch dramas. If anyone in here likes to watch kdramas/cdramas/jdramas/reality shows, you have definitely hear if Viki. I use the basic account, no Viki Pass/Viki Pass Plus, so I have to go through the ads and all. This adblocker actually blocks them all. Some inefficient ones can't go through Viki and Viki will usually tell you to turn off your adblocker. Howevere, this adblocker is just amazing. Anyways, I don't think theres any bad parts (not any yet, at least).

DYNAMITE! This extension supremely exceeds my expectations. All I expected it to do when I first added it to my web browser was to just block annoying pop-ups but it also blocks my YouTube ads. Not only that, there is also a neat feature called "Block element..."! This may be TMI, but I had an assignment on Google Classroom from a previous semester which I wasn't satisfied with my grade, though my teacher would not let me redo it. Sometimes I would accidentally click on old assignments, and it the grade on that assignment still haunted me every time I saw it, even though it was from the past. I used the "Block element" feature to hide my grade and comments from my teacher on that specific assignment from my view. Bam! I don't have to see any unwanted negativity from the past. This extension is a MUST-HAVE! 😁

So used to this app and how well it works that using a machine without it looks bizarre and bloated. Works great "out of the box" but with a few tweaks you'll never see annoyances or ads again. Be sure to know how to whitelist a site if you find its blocking an element you need. Don't leave a negative review because you don't understand or know how to do something, that's on you not uBlock.
***Be sure to use uBlock ORIGIN only not uBlock***

It's the best you can use, period. It does a better job as a first line defense of keeping annoying and malicious garbage websites can through at you at bay. I do understand that some of the smaller sites do rely on ad revenue to keep going and it's a very simple matter to disable ublock on a site to site basis. On the other hand most sites have gotten abusive to their visitors and for this I cannot express my gratitude to the author by making this extension available. Very lightweight. I don't know it's there on both my Apple and Windows systems although it's obvious it gets the job done well. Yes I am a fanboy!

I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.

I could never go back to how horrible the web was before ad-blockers, with pop-ups and blinking banner-ads everywhere. Now all is clean and nice. Web developers need to make advertising less intrusive or people will always block ads.

I love being able to forget that YouTube has ads. And Spotify's web player.

Notable features: Element zapper (hold shift to keep using it), disable all blocking for the current site with one click (with complimentary reload button nearby), manual site blocking, premade lists for malicious and undesireable site blocking (sites such as ad redirects), easy options to disable said blocking temporarily (a few minutes) or permanently when encountering a blacklisted site.

I haven't used these, but it seems useful to have options to block "all popups," "large media elements" (i.e. autoplaying videos), and JavaScript (I'm afraid to know when you'd need that).
-------------------------

By now a lot better than ABP. Takes less time to load and there's practically no site targeting it.

By just using it a few minutes I can already tell this is my new adblocker. I was in my fury using three of the classic adblockers before this one, at the same time.

It'll be only days and everyone I know will be using this one too. Thanks!

You really can't go wrong with this. Low resource usage, effective ad-blocking, and a little bit of security on top of it all, blocking dangerous popups from running on your browser. They offer an easy-access method of allowing certain ads as well, to support sources that you believe deserve them. Overall, just easy to use, effective, and very minimal in it's footprint for being so effective. It beats out every competitor, in every way.

A great ad and tracking blocker, that lets the users define how much they want to block. 
A great way to only accept a minimal amount of ads that's not ridiculously annoying.

Working great so far! Has solved my super annoying ad  invasion on my Outlook email! Super helpful with smoother scrolling because no ads are loading and sucking up resources! Saving on bandwidth too! Huge thank you to the creators!

One of the best out there, block any pop-ups or any harmful ads without much modification.

paid
Excellent. Necessary. If everyone used this extension we'd have less clickbait and sensation news, and a sensible way to pay the sites we visit. All ads you view makes the content provider on average about $10 per month. I'd much rather just pay that directly. Then I could also control who does not get paid because of bad content quality. The whole internet would be elevated and those who do a good job would make good money.

Been using this for a month now and I wish I switch sooner. ABP been letting pop-ups on a few websites I visit. At least with this one it have a sheld to protect those annoying fullscreen ones.

I have been a long time user of this extension and it has never failed me yet. I highly recommend this to everyone who wants to get rid of annoying ads and banners. I also recommend getting the "uBlock Protector" extension so you stop getting anti-adblock warnings when visiting websites.

Absoulutly amazing. I have not seen an ad on youtube or any other site since getting this extension! if you  are annoyed of ads you should defintely get this ad blocker.

I don't know if I got a pre configured one but I synced Chromium on my Pi to the Chrome on my PC and this little add on came with and it only struck me today how I have gotten no pop up windows or anything since then and honestly this might be the best and most powerful popup and add blocker I have ever had the pleasure of using. Good job to the team behind this and thanks a ton!

way overzealous adblocker, blocks EVERYTHING everywhere. It's like the chainsaw of adblockers, there is no subtlety it's everything everything in existence so no site ever works or nothing without individual tinkering. Annoying.

THIS is the greatest popup blocker ever. I especially love the block element function! Right click any annoying element of a website even if it is not an ad, select "block element", select the wrapper html element  in the popup that shows up and enjoy the website without that SIGN UP HERE or whatever crap they are throwing at you!

This blocks lots of pop-up, pop-unders and generally most annoying advertising.

UBlock Origin is currently the best overall set-it-and-forget-it ad blocker/general-purpose blocker browser extension with the lowest RAM and CPU usage in my opinion, and it is the only one that I have used so far that can block most annoying pop-up ads.

Just a request for the dev. This ad blocker is not working well with vipbox - a streaming website. There are still way too many ads and popups on that site. In the past, this extension was working well on vipbox but now all the ads and popups are coming up again. These streaming websites are infested with all sorts of malicious ads and popups and a working ad block would be really helpful. Thanks.

Ad Blocker is clunky, the amount of times I've had slow loading of pages with "waiting for ad blocker" at the bottom and then I noticed it wasn't dealing with pop ups and letting YouTube ads through so I wondered what the point of it was.  Someone mentioned this on a friend's facebook thread so I went for it and I've never looked back.  It's pretty cool, no need to know lots of scripting and you can block certain parts of a page as well.  It's also great with shutting down those annoying new tab ads that certain sites have started doing now.
-------------------------
annoy
It simply works better than adblock! Adblock allow some annoying ads and I can't remove annoying adds even with manual way. Ublock origin simply do it so easily!
-------------------------
annoy
Since Adblock sold out, this is the best blocker I've seen (should have changed to this ages ago).

I've been using this for a while now and it's much better, blocks more efficiently annoying ads and performance is quite nice.

Extensive filter lists to choose from (defaults are fine without any addition).
Plus also same (and extended) "own filtering" as Adblock, which you can import.
-------------------------
popup
For the moment, this add-on seems to be really better than Adblock. For a long while now I started to have annoying pop-ups passing through Adblock. I tried Ublock (first heard about it today in a FB comment) and no more annoying pop-up!!! With Adblock being sold outs now, this is a great alternative!

Ads is not a problem that this extension solves... generally it helps to deal with unrequested embeddables.
A single blog website may contain 20-30 of them and you can safely turn off 80% of that stuff to reduce requests to external sources without losing visual experience.(marketing SaaS and social networking widgets, tracking scripts)
I use it paired with uMatrix and it provides full control over traffic (with system-wide firewall of course).
This tool can help you to become a bit more tech-savvy. You will learn to understand what a single webpage consist of, what type of sources are necessary, how CDN works and how many steps it takes for youtube video to be displayed on a website. You'll have to tune settings for each favorite website. It's all not much harder than learning TV remote, so you can adjust your web experience and consume content in your own way.
-------------------------
annoy
The best blocker yet!!!Thanks UBlock Origin...I can actually listen to my playlists on youtube without annoying adds!
-------------------------
annoy
Really like it. The best I have found. What I really like is that you CAN block individual elements of a whitelisted site. 

I actually don't like to take away someone's bread and butter by blocking the ads. So I was looking for a filter to protect me from spyware and malware which they all do but I also wanted a way to block individual horrendously annoying elements easily which this does pretty well. The others don't let you do anything on a whitelisted site. This one does. This is important to me because I actually whitelist most sites.

Actually, I just tried it on a site, just on a large ad in the top right block. When you ad the filter it disappears, but each refresh brings another one back. 

I will still stick with this though. Out of 7 I tried, only one comes close to this. 

Maybe I really don't even need this though because I do not go to any "questionable" sites. It is comforting for first time visits.

Thank you for this fine piece of software.

Fantastic extension! Very customizeable and eliminates the need for many other extensions if you dig into the settings and make informed choices. Low on system resources and works perfectly with no nagging or other nuisances. Don't forget to use the eye-dropper function for selectively eliminating annoying frames in certain Web pages (like Facebook's right side ad panel).

It would be 5 star if it had the option to allow unobtrusive ads. This application incentivizes marketers to come up with new, innovative ways to annoy you. ABP incentivizes marketers to advertise in a way that's not distracting to the content, which is a step in the right direction for a better web. It lets me still support the websites I visit to boot. uBlock please add this feature!

It's not perfect, it's best to have a backup adblocker but there's a reason I've kept this one for many years while the backup often changes. This is the toughest most reliable adblocker I've ever had, too tough for some as it can break some websites. It might not always catch all the ads but the manual blocking tool works great and the ads stay blocked.

Better than Adblock Plus. ABP is great especially combined with a browser with built in adblocking, but it only goes so far, there are still some ads that can get through them such as ones built into video player clients (no other adblocking method I've tried has been able to stop them besides uBlock Origin). uBlock also blocks other ads too, but I was mostly concerned with trying to get the ads baked into video players to go away.

Dear Raymond Hill,

This adblocker... is unlike any adblocker I've ever seen. One time when I was on PowerPoint Mobile online, I saw that Ublock Origin blocked 103 ads on that page. That's insane.

That's very convenient for me and is AWESOME to see. I love your product, man!!! ❤

I've been using uBlock Origin for years and it's the best ad blocker out there! It blocks every single kind of ad aggressively. Pages even load much faster as a result, I also love the element blocking feature. BTW, great job! much more than an ad blocker!
-------------------------
fail
I use it in addition to AdBlock. It's a lot more effective at blocking bothersome content. It's worth noting that once in a while but rarely it blocks content you want to see such as a video. So if something like a video appears blank then turn off uBlock and refresh the page. The best aspect of uBlock is that lots of website have picked up on people using the most common blocker, AdBlock, and so these websites insist that you turn off AdBlock before proceeding. The websites always fail to do this with uBlock though so you can still do what you set out to and block those bothersome ads. Brilliant.
-------------------------

In my opinion, and many reviews aswell, best adblocker which reduces website load times the most, while also being the most efficient and using least memory and CPU resources. Awesome!

Highly recommend this extension for blocking ads. It works exactly the way it says it does.

The issue with Twitch ads coming through is annoying, but I think that is Twitch not Ublock failing.

Pretty good adblocker until it stopped blocking ads on Youtube and Twitch.

fix
This is the best adblock by far, except now that twitch ads are back again, please fix!

You should really give it 5 stars not 1 star if you've used it for so long and relied on it to stop twitch ads. Show some support perhaps they'll fix it and you'll carry on taking advantage of this amazing plugin.

Beware of imitators (Google / Chrome apparently don't care to stop them). This is the real deal and one of the few relatively "safe" ways to use a web cluttered with ads and malware.

Been using this for years and it has never failed me once

Flawless. Just works really well and shows no bugs or problems.
-------------------------

this is the first ad blocker app and/or extention ive ever used and ive tried them all the way backto my 386 with a 280 (something) baud modem! does exactly what it claims and even some more too. Since i added it i really have not seen even 1 youtube ad exept for the ones in the actual vids done by the channel themselves (like for skill share, mubi, or of course RAID SHADOW LEGEND or fn wikibuy! but not one previd or even the random inside the video ones either. Not only that but if you are familiar  fmovies or putlocker or 123movies etc, you will know the way those sites make you click ads 3-5 times one after the lother over and over again till they finally stop to start a movie and then at least 1 more to change volume and 1 to click full screen too, well i havnt had to click even one. seriously it goes straight into EVERY VID!!! i cant say enough how well this works. and i Am a real person. i mean look at my spelling. a app developer or a review bot would spell better than me. unless i was programmed to spell incorrectly to seem real. wait ... am i real. i dont actually rember my mom or my brothers. just hazy implanted memories???but, i feel real! i dont know now oh well either way, this shiz really works a 5...out of 5

Works better than AdBlock Plus. The popups on DailyMail.co.uk were getting really bad and uBlock stopped all of them.
-------------------------
fix
3 stars now as it no longer blocks ads on Twitch. definite 5 stars if it's fixed!
-------------------------
access
I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.
-------------------------

This is the best aadblock no doubt about it, and the function to block specific elements from loading in a specific webpage is a very useful tool.
-------------------------
error
Ah yes look into the PEBKAC error code, that'll help!
-------------------------
stop
Ublock Origin stopped me from clicking through to several tracking websites from email today and yesterday and showed me a great message about what was exactly wrong with the links and where they were sending me to. Absolutely awesome, even better than Adblock Plus
-------------------------
reload
I love being able to forget that YouTube has ads. And Spotify's web player.

Notable features: Element zapper (hold shift to keep using it), disable all blocking for the current site with one click (with complimentary reload button nearby), manual site blocking, premade lists for malicious and undesireable site blocking (sites such as ad redirects), easy options to disable said blocking temporarily (a few minutes) or permanently when encountering a blacklisted site.

I haven't used these, but it seems useful to have options to block "all popups," "large media elements" (i.e. autoplaying videos), and JavaScript (I'm afraid to know when you'd need that).
-------------------------
load
By now a lot better than ABP. Takes less time to load and there's practically no site targeting it. What I would love is to have the possibility to block Cookie Agreements as well, they've become more annoying than ads itself. They're everywhere. I don't know whether this is possible or not, but would be a great great feature.

best adblocker is the best and hasn't failed me just yet

Best adblocker to date, it has all the lists built in that you can choose from, it also seems to be the fastest, most efficient, and therefore uses less battery when I'm using a laptop.  I had to stop using Adblock Plus because the battery drain on laptops was absolutely terrible.  Thank you Raymond Hill (gorhill)!

access
Reliable, Fast and and thorough! uBlock Origin is seriously one of the best add-ons you can get for a browser and should be running on everyone's internet browser. It doesn't get in your way and block the websites you want to access [unless they're actually malicious] like other AdBlocker services do.
-------------------------
break
[ Overview ]   Best product. Blocks ads and unwanted content most of the time most of the time
[ To advertisers ]   If you break through, I close the page and make sure to NOT buy your stuff
[ To devs ] Often I CAN select the only valuable part of the website (actual text) with "block selected". Please add feature "only show selected". Otherwise wide empty margins (for killed ads) show up.
Also, please add features "toggle/remove user filter for this page".

Just one of the best browser security tool, period. You cannot imagine just how some attacks are sophisticated nowadays and deployed on a large scale. Some of the nastiest malware are distributed on webservers and with javascript we leave the door open. Also thumbs up for the performance and customization available.

I used ADB for years, but it stopped working and the performance hit was always meh. I'm very happy with uBlock Origin -- strong filters, strong performance.
I'm a big fan of its ability to pause links that redirect you to ad middlemen. A normal and rarely dangerous thing, but it's nice to have full control over my browser.
-------------------------
mess
Awesome!!! This is a MUST-HAVE extension.

I am an advanced user and have tried virtually every major ad and tracker blocker. 

Without hesitation, this is the best one for both blocking ads and trackers.

Whether you're an advanced or casual user, it gives you the amount of control that you want to take.  If a site is having problems because of blocked content, uBlock Origin makes it easy to fix it.

And if you mess up any of the settings, going back to default or unblocked is super easy.
-------------------------
stop
I have been a long time user of this extension and it has never failed me yet. I highly recommend this to everyone who wants to get rid of annoying ads and banners. I also recommend getting the "uBlock Protector" extension so you stop getting anti-adblock warnings when visiting websites.

Oh, this is fantastic! In just three web pages, 35 ads were blocked, and the speed the web pages are loading is great! I use a lot of recipe pages, and they always have boatloads of ads.  My computer is not high-end, and low on RAM, so it's fast enough for pages without ads, but throw in those ads and things move at a snail's pace.  Thank you uBlock Origin/Raymond Hill for making this available.  Makes browsing so much better.

As has been mentioned earlier, this is a FAR better extension than Adblock Plus because:

* it's smaller
• it's faster
• it requires less memory
• it doesn't hang or crash Chrome

I use it in conjunction with another extension called "Disconnect". Here is an article (for techies) with a head to head benchmark test demonstrating why uBlock is far superior to ABP.

Works perfectly with the Ublock origin extra extension. Works very well for 99.9% of the sites I visit. I absolutely hated the ad bombs that news sites put up. They have so many ads on their sites that I can't even load the page up. It takes 5 minutes for it to load up and takes me awhile to close all the ads.

Even adblock didn't work on news sites as well as many others. ublock origin is the real deal and I'll be donating to them once I get more funds.

I really like it, runs nice and quiet in the background. It's so quiet, in-fact I can't tell when it UNINSTALLS itself every day. I have no idea how to fix it; the app preferences have no way to solve this. It really IS the best ad blocker around you'll find.

Ad Blocker is clunky, the amount of times I've had slow loading of pages with "waiting for ad blocker" at the bottom and then I noticed it wasn't dealing with pop ups and letting YouTube ads through so I wondered what the point of it was.  Someone mentioned this on a friend's facebook thread so I went for it and I've never looked back.  It's pretty cool, no need to know lots of scripting and you can block certain parts of a page as well.  It's also great with shutting down those annoying new tab ads that certain sites have started doing now.

Slim down all the crap your browser is told to download by the sites you're visiting. Great for users more comfortable tweaking settings as well as those who just want a cleaner surfing experience. 

For those in the latter category: be prepared for more interaction with your browser as you may find videos, images, comment sections, etc., not loading like you're accustomed to. 

Once you learn the ad block way, you can never go back. 

Want to support sites by allowing ads? Whitelist them.

By far the absolute best ad blocker on any market. AdBlockPlus failed for years and had a clunky interface compared to uBlock Origin. Get this Ad Blocker because it really works! Works so good I can't say enough good things about it. Try it and find out for yourself. By default it adds a few good repositories but you can add more and they've done the work for you to, just check the ones you need added and Apply changes.

Significantly reduced memory usage vs ABP even with many more filters enabled.  Reduced CPU usage, reduced load times.

ABP was revolutionary for its time, but now it's been surpassed.

Ugly looking icon?  I think not.  I like the new icon.  It's about time.  The old one looked just like the adblock stop sign.  I'm sticking with this origin version since it is run by the original author.

Keep up the good work Mr. Hill.  Your work, dedication and passion on this program are appreciated.

Great extension for browsing especially with the amount of ads on pages anymore. Speeds up page loading due to less needing to be downloaded from servers.

I've been using AdBlock for a year and finally switched due to my subscriptions not loading properly in YouTube. Well this extension fixed all of that and Chrome runs quite a bit faster now.

Top marks for this ad blocking app, it really is the best in it's class. I would advise all Adblock(+) users to install µBlock immediately. You'll notice that pages load like the speed of lightning as its far more efficient and doesn't require dumping 20megs of css rules into the DOM for every page and iframe :)

This is pretty comprehensive protection, blocking more than any single protection extension in Google's Catalog right out of the box. Tweaking it is surprisingly easy and I've never had a single issue with it breaking a website to date.

It's good;  And its definitly quite a bit faster.  Howerver it breaks a lot of websites.  If you're not paying attention or not thinking about it, the web page you're looking for won't be loading or won't be working properly; and this guy is the culprit.

Definitely light on CPU and works great except when it works too great.

As capable as Adblock Plus but uses ~1/2 the ram, allows pages to load a little faster, and no company behind it to take money to allow select/"premium" website ads through vs the little guys.

Very impressed so far. I didn't have many slowdown issues with Adblock (Adblock Plus was really problematic for me, plus sellout-concerns), but the ones I had this fixed.

I'm not quite sure I am on board with the default loadout of blocks, because I also run Ghostery and I suspect the privacy-related stuff is superfluous as a result. Still, a very good extension and heartily recommended.

Hi, I appreciate this extension ALOT. Thank you. Is there a way to run uBlock OFF by default? As a webdev, sometimes I need to disable uBlock and it's a pain in the butt to manually do it every time I load a new page. Sometimes I forget it's on and I spend 20 mins debugging something when if I had turned it off it would've taken me 5. Thanks!

JW Player Version 7.11.12 . Player works in incognito mode or when the uBlock Origin is disabled from that site, it's not on my user based filters as it is on the auto filters generated and expired every 4 days. If you could isolate the issue and fix it thank you for your browser plugin its been very handy these past years. https://www.watchcartoononline.io/playlist-cat/396/yu-gi-oh-gx-episode-119-english-dubbed

Hi, and thanks for the great extension :) I noticed that for the past week or so that, on a specific news website, UBO blocks all the ads and paywall (as it should) but it also prevent the site from loading images. It happens only on the front page; all secondary pages work fine with the extension. Not sure if it's been happening with other news portals or websites, but I thought I'd let you guys know.

TL;DR: Consider the following filters ||www.google.com/logos/doodles/$image will stop doodles from downloading, www.google.com###lga will hide the entire block. To get in-depth advice you should ask questions on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/ or better yet, you could read the docs and be able to use uBlock Origin the way you like: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger

I run a simple website, www.sustainable-properties-forsale.com which has lots of photos of properties. There are no adverts on the site but the pictures are being blocked. Can you tell me why this is and what I can do to stop it since it is inhibiting people from using the site.
-------------------------
load
Hi, First off, thank you for this incredible extension, it's easily the best ad-blocker I've ever used. But I have a website that won't let me read its content unless I disable it. I don't want to do that because the site then takes much longer to load etc. I was thinking you could develop a "light" or "incognito" mode that blocks the maximum number of elements without being recognized.

Thank you for your quick reply. I indeed didn't see the "Apply Changes" button popping up on the other side of my screen. On a FullHD screen this button pops up way out of my area of attention: http://i.imgur.com/N7a109H.jpg You might wanna change the design in this section. Two ideas from me: 1. Fix all buttons to the top so they remain visible when you scroll down. Put the "apply" button right next to the other two buttons. Disable (grey out) the button, when no changes are available. Make it orange, when changes were made that have to be confirmed. 2. Drop the "apply" button alltogether. People coming from the other two ad-blocker apps are used to not having to confirm any changes. Box ticked, change applied. Works like a charm. Awesome app by the way. Keep up the good work. :)

Thank you very much for your replay BilBg, Great respect for your wonderful work regardin uBlock Origin. I don't have to post here the lists witch are not checked, because those ones show "0 used of XXXX" too. These are the "0 used of XXXX" checked lists: 1. Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List (forums.lanik.us): 0 used out of 909 2. Fanboy’s Social Blocking List (forums.lanik.us): 0 used out of 12,864 But tell me please, if i will use Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List I can uncheck all those above 7 lists from the first post? Is it a good idea, considering: 1.hardware resources used by loading the lists 2.how often is Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List updated compared with the 7 lists? 3.

tracking - 26
redirect
Never got an ad ever in YouTube for a year now and I'm surprised and it works perfectly fine. It blocks every ads but there are some ads that still displays if you go into a sussy website but I don't rlly mind since it's on the side but it blocks annoying ads that are like fake messages, redirect popups suspicious links, popups, etc. This is the best adblock extension in my opinion.
-------------------------
redirect
Best spectrum content blocker, I have ever used. Never had a problem with it. It blocks all ads, pop-ups, redirects, trackers and malicious links. Very Happy with the Extension🙂🙂
-------------------------
vpn
I mean it's good, works but not really the best but it's good that it works and it's free. Also is this a vpn as well? just asking.
-------------------------
redirect
Absolutely brilliant product, blocks almost every ad and redirect on almost every site. Way better than I expected.
-------------------------
javascript
I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.
-------------------------
javascript
I love being able to forget that YouTube has ads. And Spotify's web player.

Notable features: Element zapper (hold shift to keep using it), disable all blocking for the current site with one click (with complimentary reload button nearby), manual site blocking, premade lists for malicious and undesireable site blocking (sites such as ad redirects), easy options to disable said blocking temporarily (a few minutes) or permanently when encountering a blacklisted site.

I haven't used these, but it seems useful to have options to block "all popups," "large media elements" (i.e. autoplaying videos), and JavaScript (I'm afraid to know when you'd need that).
-------------------------

It's simply great! Switched to it after ABP and never regretted. Simple to set up and use with a bunch of built-in 3rd party filters. My kudos to devs for all their generous efforts keeping such a feature-rich app up-to-date and ABSOLUTELY FREE!!!
-------------------------

No spyware and malicious javascript injections like in AdBlock. Works great!

Just one of the best browser security tool, period. You cannot imagine just how some attacks are sophisticated nowadays and deployed on a large scale.

I used ADB for years, but it stopped working and the performance hit was always meh. I'm very happy with uBlock Origin -- strong filters, strong performance.
I'm a big fan of its ability to pause links that redirect you to ad middlemen. A normal and rarely dangerous thing, but it's nice to have full control over my browser.

This is a great addon it not only blocks annoying ads and popups it blocks redirects on websites to malicious content. Highly recommended.

Go to the Costco site by entering the URL in the address bar. If it blocks it do the following while still on that page... Just find the extension icon for Ublock Origin (on Chrome its under the puzzle looking piece unless you pinned it) LEFT Click on it Press the BIG Blue Power Button Now Click the Refresh Symbol that just appeared to the right of the Blue Power Button! If you are being redirected to sites it may block the site... Again you can turn off Ublock Origin from any site by doing what I described above. This is the best blocker out there!

It's not perfect, it's best to have a backup adblocker but there's a reason I've kept this one for many years while the backup often changes. This is the toughest most reliable adblocker I've ever had, too tough for some as it can break some websites. It might not always catch all the ads but the manual blocking tool works great and the ads stay blocked. This extention with a supplementary kinder adblocker for those sites that can't take it has made being on the internet so much easier and less annoying

Overall great but I don't like that it blocks Honey by default and it's hard to stop it unless you just turn it off. It gives me the option to add to whitelist, so I choose that and it opens a page with a bunch of code and no other instructions. I figure it's good to go and it's still blocking honey. Would be nice if it made it more clear on how to whitelist chrome addons.

Ublock has been a nice reliable and customizable blocker over the years. There is more power there than I need. The best features are the automated ones and ability to right clock block elements since most people aren't going to spend a lot of time figuring out complex options.

PLEASE add ability to easily block entire sites. Look at all the low quality site blocker/time management apps people download. Ublock could be getting some of that traffic by simply add in the ability to block entire sites or even add in time periods to block sites at certain times as these are SUPER easy options compared to the other coding the developers have done to filter out specific elements. A nice right click block entire site option would be nice.

This is actually so good, just need to right click on what I wanted to delete and highlight it and boom gone permanently and if I needed to get a part back, I can just go into the my filters and delete it from there and I learned all this just a few minutes ago when this post was made, so I highly recommend anyone who has that annoying feature on their favourite site or for any ads (which this does automatically), this is very good indeed. (Edit): When it stopped blocking ads I just reinstalled and that did the job, until they update that's probably the way to fix the issue. And you can import anything you want removed.

This is an adblocker I have been using for about 3 weeks now, and I just have to say that I love it. It's amazing, and works just fine for me. When I go to sites to watch dramas, they usually have a lot of pop-up ads. With this extension, it doesn't happen anymore. Same for youtube. I don't have to deal wit ads there anymore! There's also another website that I use to watch dramas. If anyone in here likes to watch kdramas/cdramas/jdramas/reality shows, you have definitely hear if Viki. I use the basic account, no Viki Pass/Viki Pass Plus, so I have to go through the ads and all. This adblocker actually blocks them all. Some inefficient ones can't go through Viki and Viki will usually tell you to turn off your adblocker. Howevere, this adblocker is just amazing. Anyways, I don't think theres any bad parts (not any yet, at least).
-------------------------

Omg- out of all the ad blockers i had this is by far the best one! if your a weeb or like to watch anime and u use crunchyroll then this is the right ad blocker for u! as soon as i clicked on an anime for example attack on titans.. ive always had trouble with watching that show since theres been so many ads and when the ad blockers did work it would always be buffering. This one removes all the ads and theres no buffering which is just- ASTRONOMICAL!! HOW EXQUISITE IS THIS AD BLOCKER! Also this is good for youtube :))

Fantastic x1000!!! My favorite feature is the element zapper (the lightning bolt after you click the ublock icon in the top right) - this gets rid of banners that follow you through the whole page which blocks a huge chunk of the screen and any other intrusive part of a website. I wish I could get this on my phone and really, in my life!

DYNAMITE! This extension supremely exceeds my expectations. All I expected it to do when I first added it to my web browser was to just block annoying pop-ups but it also blocks my YouTube ads. Not only that, there is also a neat feature called "Block element..."! This may be TMI, but I had an assignment on Google Classroom from a previous semester which I wasn't satisfied with my grade, though my teacher would not let me redo it. Sometimes I would accidentally click on old assignments, and it the grade on that assignment still haunted me every time I saw it, even though it was from the past. I used the "Block element" feature to hide my grade and comments from my teacher on that specific assignment from my view. Bam! I don't have to see any unwanted negativity from the past. This extension is a MUST-HAVE! 😁

I use it in addition to AdBlock. It's a lot more effective at blocking bothersome content. It's worth noting that once in a while but rarely it blocks content you want to see such as a video. So if something like a video appears blank then turn off uBlock and refresh the page. The best aspect of uBlock is that lots of website have picked up on people using the most common blocker, AdBlock, and so these websites insist that you turn off AdBlock before proceeding. The websites always fail to do this with uBlock though so you can still do what you set out to and block those bothersome ads. Brilliant.

very good and block element also helps many of my friends struggle to respawn in some games after long ads but me i have this powerful extension best for anime website too and if something is that u want to remove like donation part or blah blah just take block element and is free also has a block pop up option and make it permanent when we click more.

this is the first ad blocker app and/or extention ive ever used and ive tried them all the way backto my 386 with a 280 (something) baud modem! does exactly what it claims and even some more too.

Not only that but if you are familiar  fmovies or putlocker or 123movies etc, you will know the way those sites make you click ads 3-5 times one after the lother over and over again till they finally stop to start a movie and then at least 1 more to change volume and 1 to click full screen too, well i havnt had to click even one. seriously it goes straight into EVERY VID!!! i cant say enough how well this works. and i Am a real person. i mean look at my spelling. a app developer or a review bot would spell better than me. unless i was programmed to spell incorrectly to seem real. wait ... am i real. i dont actually rember my mom or my brothers. just hazy implanted memories???but, i feel real! i dont know now oh well either way, this shiz really works a 5...out of 5

Literally the most amazing adblocker. Started using it in 2019. Absolutely amazing. Never once had a problem. Only complaint is that some ads aren't blocked but since there is a manual element blocker it's practically not a complaint but a TINY flaw which is fine. Nothing's perfect.

best ad blocker out there, it can help on even adfly, where it automatically skips to the end without waiting for the ads to finish.

Pretty good adblocker with room for improvement.  While ublock does have the most stringent ad blocking it's a completely scorched earth product by default.  Unlike the original adblock there's not an easy way to operate in a blacklist mode instead of a whitelist mode (blacklist meaning ads are allowed unless you blacklist the site you are on at which point they are blocked).  .Ideally with one or two clicks it could be changed to a blacklist mode blocker.

The performance is good, and the amount of ads that are blocked is unrivaled.  Good product overall but I prefer the original adblock so I can allow more easily allow sites some ad revenue by default and only block them if their ads are obnoxious.

I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.
-------------------------

The best ad-blocker I've tried. I particularly like how easy it is to turn on or off. There are some sites I don't want to block the ads for, such as when I'm watching a YouTuber who depends on ad revenue. uBlock remembers which sites you don't want to block the ads for as well, so you don't have to remember to switch it back on or off.

I love being able to forget that YouTube has ads. And Spotify's web player.

Notable features: Element zapper (hold shift to keep using it), disable all blocking for the current site with one click (with complimentary reload button nearby), manual site blocking, premade lists for malicious and undesireable site blocking (sites such as ad redirects), easy options to disable said blocking temporarily (a few minutes) or permanently when encountering a blacklisted site.

I haven't used these, but it seems useful to have options to block "all popups," "large media elements" (i.e. autoplaying videos), and JavaScript (I'm afraid to know when you'd need that).

This from my experience is the greatest ad block extension available, you can filter for what you want manually, or add in bulk by copying filter lists, allowing for great versatility over other ad block software I've tried, it's also a relatively light extension as far as high end ad block extensions come, so that's another big plus, I can't fault Ublock-Origin at all, it's a must.

Ads is not a problem that this extension solves... generally it helps to deal with unrequested embeddables.
A single blog website may contain 20-30 of them and you can safely turn off 80% of that stuff to reduce requests to external sources without losing visual experience.(marketing SaaS and social networking widgets, tracking scripts)
I use it paired with uMatrix and it provides full control over traffic (with system-wide firewall of course).
This tool can help you to become a bit more tech-savvy. You will learn to understand what a single webpage consist of, what type of sources are necessary, how CDN works and how many steps it takes for youtube video to be displayed on a website. You'll have to tune settings for each favorite website. It's all not much harder than learning TV remote, so you can adjust your web experience and consume content in your own way.

> If for example you block a page element and that same element is shown again in multiple locations on the webpage or domain. This really needs to be able to block all similar items or block parent items across similar pages or entire domains.

The element picker tells you you can use <Ctrl>-click: this will effectively select all similar elements on the page.

It also offers you the all the parent elements of the element you clicked, it's just a matter of clicking on an entry other than the first one in the list to select one of the parent element.

Better than all other adblockers I've tried.  uBlock Origin does the job perfectly and uses so little resources, you don't notice it being there.  It also starts up much faster in Chrome compared to the other popular adblockers.  Very rarely needs turning off, as 99.9% of sites work absolutely fine with it.  uBlock Origin also enhances privacy (not just by blocking ads), so another good reason to add it to Chrome.

Great adblock extension. My favorite feature is the toggling of certain filtering/blocking (i.e. cosmetic filtering, strict blocking, etc.) It makes it really helpful on sites that say turn off your adblock. Most of the time I toggle the cosmetic blocking and it doesn't even recognize the extension. Plus, it has a ton of filter lists to boot so it's my favorite and I've tried all of them.

-------------------------

Much better than ABP, however, it does tend to block a bit too much. It would be nice if it was easier to block individual page elements like you can in ABP. 

Like, for instance, when on certain video sites, it manages to block the ads, but it also blocks some content. And therefore I can't turn it off because I'd lose the adblocking, but I'm also losing some content. 

But either way, it is still infinitely better than ABP. Thanks for creating this!

Hi, I'm really confused as to whether I have Ublock Origin on my phone or not. I got no feedback as to whether it had downloaded when I tried the process yesterday, then had a message flash up on my surface this morning (although it was my phone I'd tried downloading to). I clicked on the message, thinking it would open with more info, but it disappeared and I'm unable to find any sign of the software on either device. I really want to use this so would appreciate your help. Many thanks, Miriam

Go to the Costco site by entering the URL in the address bar. If it blocks it do the following while still on that page... Just find the extension icon for Ublock Origin (on Chrome its under the puzzle looking piece unless you pinned it) LEFT Click on it Press the BIG Blue Power Button Now Click the Refresh Symbol that just appeared to the right of the Blue Power Button! If you are being redirected to sites it may block the site... Again you can turn off Ublock Origin from any site by doing what I described above. This is the best blocker out there! Its really easy to use, you will learn! Its Easy!

Dear developers, Nowadays website layouts are optimized to display ads and teasers. I use "block element" for each unwanted element in header/footer/side panels. End result - huge empty margins. This is much better than ads, but can still be improved. Desired features for "preview/bock/pick/quit" panel: * Add button "Only show selected" that hides everything BUT selected and sets margins/padding of outer containers to zero. Use case: select the only relevant pane in one click and maximize the pane. * Add controls to toggle "show/hide/highlight" and to unblock unblock elements affected by user defined filters. Use case: restore accidentally blocked element.

Hi, I've discovered your extension thanks to Martin's post on ghacks.net; great work, I really like it. Two questions/suggestions: 1. Could you add an overview of all whitelisted (I mean: whitelisting by clicking the enable/disable button in the drop down menu) sites to the settings? What would be even better: an option to import/export those filters. 2. It would be nice to be able to globally enable/disable the filtering (without having to disable the whole extension). Sometimes I want to browse multiple sites without adblockers and it's much easier to temporarily pause filtering globally than to turn it off (and then on back again later on) for each site separately. Thanks for your effort! Simon

Ublock has been a nice reliable and customizable blocker over the years. There is more power there than I need. The best features are the automated ones and ability to right clock block elements since most people aren't going to spend a lot of time figuring out complex options.

PLEASE add ability to easily block entire sites. Look at all the low quality site blocker/time management apps people download. Ublock could be getting some of that traffic by simply add in the ability to block entire sites or even add in time periods to block sites at certain times as these are SUPER easy options compared to the other coding the developers have done to filter out specific elements. A nice right click block entire site option would be nice.

This is actually so good, just need to right click on what I wanted to delete and highlight it and boom gone permanently and if I needed to get a part back, I can just go into the my filters and delete it from there and I learned all this just a few minutes ago when this post was made, so I highly recommend anyone who has that annoying feature on their favourite site or for any ads (which this does automatically), this is very good indeed. (Edit): When it stopped blocking ads I just reinstalled and that did the job, until they update that's probably the way to fix the issue. And you can import anything you want removed.

Pretty good adblocker with room for improvement.  While ublock does have the most stringent ad blocking it's a completely scorched earth product by default.  Unlike the original adblock there's not an easy way to operate in a blacklist mode instead of a whitelist mode (blacklist meaning ads are allowed unless you blacklist the site you are on at which point they are blocked).  .Ideally with one or two clicks it could be changed to a blacklist mode blocker.

The performance is good, and the amount of ads that are blocked is unrivaled.  Good product overall but I prefer the original adblock so I can allow more easily allow sites some ad revenue by default and only block them if their ads are obnoxious.

The best ad block extension I have ever used. Undetectable by pages that require whitelist, blocks all ads on pages, not only popups, but TrafficJunky and similar services as well. No more annoying ads on YouTube, Twitch.tv and similar pages. Custom rules, filters, whitelists, IP blocks, everything can be edited in HTML as well as be transferred across clients and platforms (for advanced users and developers). Extension is supported on GitHub as well. I absolutely love it! 5 stars!

So used to this app and how well it works that using a machine without it looks bizarre and bloated. Works great "out of the box" but with a few tweaks you'll never see annoyances or ads again. Be sure to know how to whitelist a site if you find its blocking an element you need. Don't leave a negative review because you don't understand or know how to do something, that's on you not uBlock.

A functional and efficient open-source extension with customizable block lists that are updated frequently.

This extension is useful for many things, not just ad blocking. For instance, if I want to take a screenshot of a webpage, I can use the thunderbolt icon to remove elements from a webpage I don't want, then take the screenshot. 
You can remove elements aside from ads.

I don't really use ublock for adblock, I mainly just use it to block malware (enabling the malware lists and unbreak filters) and remove elements as I see fit. It's good for this purpose because of its excellent customizability.

uBlock Origin has been the king of adblocking on Chrome for years now, and for very good reason. It's efficient and provides sane defaults, all while allowing power users to customize everything as they see fit.

The cloud storage support is also one of the top features to note, allowing you to easily synchronize all your filters, rules and whitelists across different machines.
-------------------------
filter
I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.
-------------------------
list
I love being able to forget that YouTube has ads. And Spotify's web player.

Notable features: Element zapper (hold shift to keep using it), disable all blocking for the current site with one click (with complimentary reload button nearby), manual site blocking, premade lists for malicious and undesireable site blocking (sites such as ad redirects), easy options to disable said blocking temporarily (a few minutes) or permanently when encountering a blacklisted site.

I haven't used these, but it seems useful to have options to block "all popups," "large media elements" (i.e. autoplaying videos), and JavaScript (I'm afraid to know when you'd need that).
-------------------------

Thank you for creating and maintaining this extension. It is quite a different Internet when the extension is turned off.

It has worked perfectly for me so far. Not a single ad has gone through in my time using it. The element zapper is pretty fun to mess around with for a few minutes. The large selection of filters is also nice.

Use the Logger for X sites. And when you see an entry like "Popup" for the specific site, click on it, select Block, then click on Create to make a custom filter for that Popup. Also, the uBlock drop-down menu has a button that says "click to block popups on this site", click on it.

This from my experience is the greatest ad block extension available, you can filter for what you want manually, or add in bulk by copying filter lists, allowing for great versatility over other ad block software I've tried, it's also a relatively light extension as far as high end ad block extensions come, so that's another big plus, I can't fault Ublock-Origin at all, it's a must.

The good
• I love it. It is owned and supported by a friendly community. Not a corporation. More secure because its code is publicly available for review and contributions on GitHub at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
• Easy to use. With both basic or advanced modes.
• Lightweight on memory and CPU resources
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome
• Clear Manifesto:
......• The user decides what web content is acceptable or not in their browser.
......• The uBlock project does not support Adblock Plus' "Acceptable Ads Manifesto", because the "Acceptable Ads" marketing campaign is really the business plan of a for-profit entity.
......• Users are best placed to know what is or is not acceptable to them. uBlock's sole purpose is to give users the means to enforce their own choices.
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome.
• Lots of features
• uBlock Origin has a better track record at fully protecting your privacy, than AdBlock Plus (ABP). There is a controversy around ABP and its related for profit corporation trying to monetize ABP via ad whitelisting. Which means that corporation sales your privacy for profit :( Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adblock_Plus#Controversy_over_ad_filtering_and_ad_whitelisting

The bad
• Confusion with the names. Between "uBlock Origin" and "uBlock". For those not familiar with those names, uBlock Origin is better than uBlock. Mostly because as of May 2017 Ublock Origin is still actively maintained and updated. Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin#uBlock_.28ublock.org.29uBlock Compare to uBlock which as not been maintained and updated for more than 2 years, since 2015, and is trying to monetize an open source project.

The best network filter ever!

list
Skynet level efficiency, Terminator level blocking!

All with incredibly low system resource footprint- save power and free up your CPU cycles!

This is the ad-blocker you want!  
Best browser-level ad-block I've seen. Install and it works. With an additional 60 seconds you can configure it and subscribe to more known & maintained ad-network lists. On top of this, it's one-click-easy to backup & export your settings and subscriptions in case you need to import them to another PC.

If you aren't using this, walk away from your PC...

whitelist
The best adblocker on the market by far.

Very low memory footprint, properly block 95+% of ads, has custom ads blocking, UI is very intuitive if you need to activate ads for a specific website or change some settings.

What about AdBlock Plus? They are now selling whitelisting, so advertisers are paying to go through the adblocking. Screw that!

Thankfully uBlock Origin isn't doing any of that crap (so far), its record is 100% clean, perfect for me.
-------------------------
list
Incredible. Highly customizable, allowing you to select which adblocking lists you want to use, or even create your own. None of this bribery from global conglomerates in exchange for whitelisting BS, like Adblock Plus has done.
-------------------------
whitelist
What you need to do. is install Tampermonkey and an add on called ANTI AD BLOCK KILLER

it removes those 'please whitelist our site' pop ups
-------------------------
list
Based on what I've read about this, including recommendations from web anonymity and security researchers, I'm glad to have it. I switched from Adblock which worked well (not perfectly) and I'm already appreciating uBlock's features. However, I knew it was going to be perfect when I saw it was from the same developer as uMatrix, which allows blocking of elements of a website based on type (script, cookie, image…) and/or source domain, and also uses lists to block all elements from ad/malware domains. It by default blocks certain elements from all external domains, although all default rules are fully editable. Speed and flexibility of the visual interface to change site rules is notable. This 'matrix' also allows us to see what is going on on the webpage- how many X from domain Y being allowed/blocked. Both uBlock and uMatrix are strongly recommended though uBlock for *everyone* and uMatrix if you're a technophile and/or especially care about minimising your footprint online. uBlock is for everyone because I don't think anyone likes ads, especially these days when they are more aggressive, even on very respectable websites. The reduced memory use and marketer tracking are two other major reasons, if you're not convinced.

You ave to be kidding. All other adblockers use way more memory with the same filter lists.

If you don't like rough (ugly) interfaces, this adblocker is not for you. However, it's actually so fast that it speeds up your browsing experience and it does an amazing job. Bonus: it's not maintained by a company with conflicting interests, as many other (good) ad-blockers actually are.
-------------------------

Dropped Adblock and Adblock plus. No matter what those extensions did not filter harmful clickbait and hidden ads on certain sites. This does the trick. Even if the downloaded list of filters doesn't catch everything, it's built in element picker (which lets you get rid of elements on a webpage) catches everything and anything. 
Honestly, adblocker and its plus cousin had faulty element pickers which is why I dropped them. This is light weight, effective and more efficient. Thank you!

FINALLY! I was constantly being tormented by mgid.com ads (sponsored content, fraught with malware and new tab ads). This is the first blocker that is able to filter their connections.

I literally love you.

[EDIT]
I did some testing to see to what extent it could block things, it also manages to close the connection of my nemesis: The invisible "click here and a new tab opens up telling you to trade binary options" ad.

HOW DO I PAY YOU FOR THIS
-------------------------
list
Works amazingly well, fast and clean. Doesn't seem to let any ads through unlike AdBlock Plus that has it's list of ads it does let through.
-------------------------
filter
Since Adblock sold out, this is the best blocker I've seen (should have changed to this ages ago).

I've been using this for a while now and it's much better, blocks more efficiently annoying ads and performance is quite nice.

Extensive filter lists to choose from (defaults are fine without any addition).
Plus also same (and extended) "own filtering" as Adblock, which you can import.
-------------------------
whitelist
The best adblocker by far. Lightweight and blocks all ads (not sellout like Adblock Plus which shows acceptable ads). Plus you can whitelist any site very easily. However best thing is the speed, it's consumes very little memory. Good job developers!
-------------------------
whitelist
Does what it is supposed to...easily whitelist pages you want to help that have unobtrusive ads.
-------------------------
whitelist
Not a bad blocker, but my main problem (and the thing that I really enjoyed about ABP before they sold out) is the fact that when you put a website on the whitelist it only allows adds ON THAT PAGE. ABP allowed you to whitelist entire domains, not just individual pages. The ability to do that with uBlock would be nice as well.
-------------------------
list
The best ad-blocking software. Easily modified in the options, with lots of custom blocking lists than can be used together.

Also didn't sell out like AdBlockPlus.
-------------------------
whitelist
Much better than other blocking solutions such as AdBlock, AdBlock+ (whitelisted some ads because money) et.c
-------------------------
filter
It is the best. Open source and with advanced user mode, you can block scripts and other trackers. Plus it has a nice list of extra filters to choose from. Way better than ABP, which whitelists many ads from big companies, like Google and Microsoft
-------------------------
filter
Best out there, but help feels like a developer with no people skills.  The best walkthroughs are NOT by the developer.

  Left is global, Right is per current site.  Green/Red is allow/deny and Gray is allow unless explicitly denied from a filter(rule).... like allow unless my adblock list blocks something from a */advertisement/* type filter. 

uMatrix is the super-advanced version, with even worse documentation... not worth the extra effort, but uBlock rocks.  Make sure you use the Origin version.

Switched from Adblock Plus which was a bigtime resource hog. uBlock Origin is much better. It is a resource-efficient, feature-rich and user-friendly ad blocker and privacy extension. I also disabled Disconnect since uBlock Origin has the ability to enable the same features Disconnect offers via blocking lists by Disconnect. I can now enjoy opening tabs again without much worrying about slowdowns. Not as stylish as Adblock Plus, but it does a better job. Cloud storage synchronization is also a cool feature.
-------------------------
blacklist
So much faster than uMatrix or ADB (even with most blacklists enabled) and very flexible; love it !

Slim down all the crap your browser is told to download by the sites you're visiting. Great for users more comfortable tweaking settings as well as those who just want a cleaner surfing experience. 

For those in the latter category: be prepared for more interaction with your browser as you may find videos, images, comment sections, etc., not loading like you're accustomed to. 

Once you learn the ad block way, you can never go back. 

Want to support sites by allowing ads? Whitelist them.
-------------------------
filter
quite fantastic really.. tho i must admit even with the serious increased filter options which is very nice... i honestly dont see it being any faster compared to the normal adblock extension...

Well at least ublock does not have whitelisting like adblock does :) so im happy with this extension for now.
-------------------------
maintain
Well developed and maintained extension many thanks to the Developers
-------------------------
filter
Really like it. The best I have found. What I really like is that you CAN block individual elements of a whitelisted site. 

I actually don't like to take away someone's bread and butter by blocking the ads. So I was looking for a filter to protect me from spyware and malware which they all do but I also wanted a way to block individual horrendously annoying elements easily which this does pretty well. The others don't let you do anything on a whitelisted site. This one does. This is important to me because I actually whitelist most sites.

Actually, I just tried it on a site, just on a large ad in the top right block. When you ad the filter it disappears, but each refresh brings another one back. 

I will still stick with this though. Out of 7 I tried, only one comes close to this. 

Maybe I really don't even need this though because I do not go to any "questionable" sites. It is comforting for first time visits.

Thank you for this fine piece of software.
-------------------------
filter
This is probably the most flexible adblocking software I've ever used. Not only does it easily bypass adblock killers and allow you to pick elements to block, but it also has an extensive, fully customizable filter list. Overall, it's my personal favorite.
-------------------------
filter
Best ad-blocker extension ever but still not invincible. 

In 2 weeks had to add over a dozen domains in "My Filters" (I don't browse "dangerous" sites)
-------------------------
list
> If for example you block a page element and that same element is shown again in multiple locations on the webpage or domain. This really needs to be able to block all similar items or block parent items across similar pages or entire domains.

The element picker tells you you can use <Ctrl>-click: this will effectively select all similar elements on the page.

It also offers you the all the parent elements of the element you clicked, it's just a matter of clicking on an entry other than the first one in the list to select one of the parent element.
-------------------------
filter
I love this extension, i had uBlock, but i would like that this extension would have a customizable filter, like AdBlock.
-------------------------
filter
Definitely, I wrote this back before I even discovered the advanced dynamic filtering, which allows me to have on-the-fly customization of how web-content is blocked. (Eg: If a certain list/global rule blocks some element/web-script you need, then set a local rule to white list it for that particular website.) Nice how they added protocol blocking as well.
-------------------------
filter
Does exactly what it says on the tin and does it well. Blocks ads/tracking elements reliably without interrupting other site content, integrates with the standard adblock filter formats used in other adblock extensions, provides an easy interface to custom-pick elements to create custom blocking rules without even needing to know the adblock script syntax. A must-have piece of the puzzle for convenience, privacy, and security concerns.

Also it was recommended by Taylor Swift on Twitter.
-------------------------
list
it does what I want it to, I also find it easy to add new content to the block lists.

Annoying banner ads, pop-ups, redirections are a thing of the past with this amazing extension. Filters out almost everything unwanted to give a soothing experience. Kudos and thumbs up to the developers.

Have tried several adblockers and found this one to be most effective and reliable. It's also unobtrusive, as one would expect.

much more effective than ad-block with all the custom filters enabled. extra nice if you have some use for non-english filter lists.

Absolutely brilliant, so many lists to choose from, better than ABP.  Can't recommend highly enough. Temporary unblocking is brilliant if you're online shopping etc.

Only missing feature is that you can't see exactly what has been blocked and what is allowed but if you turn advanced mode on you get some way towards showing this.

uBlock Origin comes with a logger, which gives the ability to inspect what uBlock is doing with network requests and DOM elements, whether something is blocked or allowed, and which filter, if any, matched a network request or DOM element

Great adblock extension. My favorite feature is the toggling of certain filtering/blocking (i.e. cosmetic filtering, strict blocking, etc.) It makes it really helpful on sites that say turn off your adblock. Most of the time I toggle the cosmetic blocking and it doesn't even recognize the extension. Plus, it has a ton of filter lists to boot so it's my favorite and I've tried all of them.

After AdBlockPlus sold its soul to allow Taboola ads and other content to bypass filters, I needed a new solution.  uBlock Origin delivers as promised.  Good Bye, Taboola and the rest of your similar garbage.

Significantly reduced memory usage vs ABP even with many more filters enabled.  Reduced CPU usage, reduced load times.

ABP was revolutionary for its time, but now it's been surpassed.

I'm glad I discovered this addon; wish I knew about it earlier.

Guten Tag Ich versuchte/verwendete viele Werbeblock Filter. Finde diesen von UBlock Origin 1.21.6 sehr gut!!! Nun ist es so, dass der Filter die Abspielung/Play Funktion auf einmal auf dem Laptop Now blockiert, was vor ca.1 Monat nicht der Fall gewesen war. Nun deinstallierte ich gar die App kurz. Ich installierte es dann nochmal und es ist immer noch so, dass es die Abspielung blockiert (nichts verändert, also wie es geladen wurde!). Es geht nur, wenn ich diese sofort kurz ausschalte und nach dem Laden sofort wieder einschalte ca.1-2 Sekunden! Sonst kommen viele Werbungen rein beim gucken. Das was mich sehr wundert, dass genau die gleiche App vorher die Seite zuverlässig wie jetzt blockierte, aber vor 1 Monat es nicht immer mühsam mit manuell Ein und Abschalten ging wegen dem Blocker, um die Sendungen auf Tv Now ( Berlin Tag und Nacht) zu schauen können. Das mühsame ist, das wenn ich vor dem Laden den Filter deaktiviere und gleich beim Laden schnell aktivieren muss, sonst rattern mir die Werbeblöcke nur so rein beim gucken der Sendung!! Also ist der Filter nach dem Laden sofort in ca.1- max 2 Sek einzuschalten! Stress pur :-)). Leider fand ich beim Googeln auch keine Hilfe, in der Sache. Unten beim anklicken vom Blocker hat es ja 5 Symbole zur Anwendung sowie hat es 4 Symbole auch oben, finde auch da keine wirkliche Funktion die es irgendwie unterbinden tut. Dankeschön.

Dear developers, Nowadays website layouts are optimized to display ads and teasers. I use "block element" for each unwanted element in header/footer/side panels. End result - huge empty margins. This is much better than ads, but can still be improved. Desired features for "preview/bock/pick/quit" panel: * Add button "Only show selected" that hides everything BUT selected and sets margins/padding of outer containers to zero. Use case: select the only relevant pane in one click and maximize the pane. * Add controls to toggle "show/hide/highlight" and to unblock unblock elements affected by user defined filters. Use case: restore accidentally blocked element.

1. add button "undo recently added block rule". This is useful in case we didn't set a good rule after all, as it might have ruined the website a bit 2.

Ability to reset all settings of current website. 4. report a website has bad behavior after using default blocking rules. This can help with others who might visit it.

This would make a tremendous difference. It's very inconvenient to make custom filters on tons of websites if you just want to temporarily pause Ublock. It's also very inconvenient to have a extra tab open just for the purpose of pausing Ublock. Adblock has had this feature for years (day one probably) and it's the only thing holding me back from fully switching. Please make Ublock even better by reconsidering this idea! :)

Dear gorhill, I'm a long time user of your extension and I really admire and appreciate your work on uBlock. The things I like the most about uBlock over other extensions are its performance, low memory usage and extensions to the EasyList grammar which makes it really powerful especially for blocking anti-adblock contents. Currently you are including some of your rules and replacement contents namely resources.txt, filters.txt and badware.txt as static assets as part of your extension itself. Since the replacement resources in resources.txt are highly effective in dealing with anti-adblock scripts, I'm wondering if you are willing to host them as part of other crowd-sourced filters like EasyList so that the community can contribute more replacement scripts for anti-adblock detection scripts and it could potentially be used by other extensions as well. Please let me know your thoughts on this suggestion. Thanks, K'vel

I'm pretty sure this is a feature in ABP, so it would be nice to see in uBlock Origin: Whitelisting specific YouTube channels. YouTube URLs are randomly generated and don't include the channel name/id in them, so there isn't a way to simple whitelist them from a domain-level. It would be nice if there was simply a button you could press in the extension menu while you're on the page to whitelist all videos from that channel.

Hi, I've discovered your extension thanks to Martin's post on ghacks.net; great work, I really like it. Two questions/suggestions: 1. Could you add an overview of all whitelisted (I mean: whitelisting by clicking the enable/disable button in the drop down menu) sites to the settings? What would be even better: an option to import/export those filters. 2. It would be nice to be able to globally enable/disable the filtering (without having to disable the whole extension). Sometimes I want to browse multiple sites without adblockers and it's much easier to temporarily pause filtering globally than to turn it off (and then on back again later on) for each site separately. Thanks for your effort! Simon

Hi,I am using 9.7.5 version and sometimes when I open links or videos of some websites by a new tab and then the new tab is closing quickly by Ublock.I will be happy if you will fix this issue.Good works

0.8.8.2 uBlock at Firefox addons store 0.9.3.5 Beta2 Firefox at github 0.9.3.0 at Chrome Web Store 0.9.4.1with ₀ ,at Chrome Web Store ... These are all the versions availlable. My question is; what is this new 9.4.1 with an ₀
-------------------------

I am the original developer of uBlock. I transferred maintainership to Chris Aljoudi because what is a hobby had become a big burden, with not as much help as I had wished, and I was no longer able to code as I wished. I continue my own fork of my own original project, and this is what this version is.

Tested with Version 42.0.2292.0 dev (64-bit), and it worked all fine. What are your custom filters and dynamic filtering rules (if any)?

Would be soooooo much useful on Android ! I hope you are working on an android version of this perfect ad blocker !

After countless years of using countless ad blockers, finally the best one bar none.
Lightweight and fast. No ads nor premium: it's free and open source. Perfect default settings. Customization for everything. Extremely powerful if one wants and knows how. Educational too given the documentation. I love it.
-------------------------
default
Can't recommend enough. Lots of great default filters for the less techy types, and easy to add more filter lists for more cautious folks as well.
-------------------------
default
Overall great but I don't like that it blocks Honey by default and it's hard to stop it unless you just turn it off. It gives me the option to add to whitelist, so I choose that and it opens a page with a bunch of code and no other instructions. I figure it's good to go and it's still blocking honey. Would be nice if it made it more clear on how to whitelist chrome addons.
-------------------------
sync
An essential for the upmost secure and private browsing experience. Just make sure to periodically go in the settings, use the "back up to file" function and store that file in a cloud, such as Google Drive or preferably a privacy-respecting provider (Proton Drive or Sync).

If it's recommended by PrivacyTools.io, it's good on my book. If you haven't checked them out, they have other solid privacy recommendations.
-------------------------
default
Pretty good adblocker with room for improvement.  While ublock does have the most stringent ad blocking it's a completely scorched earth product by default.  Unlike the original adblock there's not an easy way to operate in a blacklist mode instead of a whitelist mode (blacklist meaning ads are allowed unless you blacklist the site you are on at which point they are blocked).  .Ideally with one or two clicks it could be changed to a blacklist mode blocker.

The performance is good, and the amount of ads that are blocked is unrivaled.  Good product overall but I prefer the original adblock so I can allow more easily allow sites some ad revenue by default and only block them if their ads are obnoxious.
-------------------------
default
ok, i just needed to "reset to default setting" and it fixed. so who will have my same issue in the future, it's all about reset the extension like default. Top app!
-------------------------

You should enable more filters (by default, extension uses the minimum number of filters that would benefit all the users):

uBlock Origin has been the king of adblocking on Chrome for years now, and for very good reason. It's efficient and provides sane defaults, all while allowing power users to customize everything as they see fit.

The cloud storage support is also one of the top features to note, allowing you to easily synchronize all your filters, rules and whitelists across different machines.
-------------------------
sync
Please add syncing to whitelists, and please add option for blacklisting instead of whitelisting. But syncing is definitely more important.

Otherwise very grateful for this extension.
-------------------------
sync
This is an insanely great add-on.

Also, enable cloud sync if you have custom filters and use the same filters everywhere.
-------------------------
sync
Syncs w/ ublock origins & https everywhere. I Love the combo. Thank yous very much Sir Raymond Hill.
-------------------------
default
Awesome!!! This is a MUST-HAVE extension.

I am an advanced user and have tried virtually every major ad and tracker blocker. 

Without hesitation, this is the best one for both blocking ads and trackers.

Whether you're an advanced or casual user, it gives you the amount of control that you want to take.  If a site is having problems because of blocked content, uBlock Origin makes it easy to fix it.

And if you mess up any of the settings, going back to default or unblocked is super easy.
-------------------------
sync
I don't know if I got a pre configured one but I synced Chromium on my Pi to the Chrome on my PC and this little add on came with and it only struck me today how I have gotten no pop up windows or anything since then and honestly this might be the best and most powerful popup and add blocker I have ever had the pleasure of using. Good job to the team behind this and thanks a ton!
-------------------------
default
Based on what I've read about this, including recommendations from web anonymity and security researchers, I'm glad to have it. I switched from Adblock which worked well (not perfectly) and I'm already appreciating uBlock's features. However, I knew it was going to be perfect when I saw it was from the same developer as uMatrix, which allows blocking of elements of a website based on type (script, cookie, image…) and/or source domain, and also uses lists to block all elements from ad/malware domains. It by default blocks certain elements from all external domains, although all default rules are fully editable. Speed and flexibility of the visual interface to change site rules is notable. This 'matrix' also allows us to see what is going on on the webpage- how many X from domain Y being allowed/blocked. Both uBlock and uMatrix are strongly recommended though uBlock for *everyone* and uMatrix if you're a technophile and/or especially care about minimising your footprint online. uBlock is for everyone because I don't think anyone likes ads, especially these days when they are more aggressive, even on very respectable websites. The reduced memory use and marketer tracking are two other major reasons, if you're not convinced.
-------------------------
sync
THE BEST option for ad blocking ever! I've tried them all folks...nothing beats this, especially the built-in sync feature. Something that is lacking in every other Chrome ad blocker!
-------------------------
default
Since Adblock sold out, this is the best blocker I've seen (should have changed to this ages ago).

I've been using this for a while now and it's much better, blocks more efficiently annoying ads and performance is quite nice.

Extensive filter lists to choose from (defaults are fine without any addition).
Plus also same (and extended) "own filtering" as Adblock, which you can import.
-------------------------
default
Protects against malicious .JS attacks in default mode.
-------------------------
default
By far the absolute best ad blocker on any market. AdBlockPlus failed for years and had a clunky interface compared to uBlock Origin. Get this Ad Blocker because it really works! Works so good I can't say enough good things about it. Try it and find out for yourself. By default it adds a few good repositories but you can add more and they've done the work for you to, just check the ones you need added and Apply changes. Also comes with a eye dropper to block anything on screen. That was always an extension to AdBlockPlus. uBlock Origin all the way!
-------------------------
default
This extension brilliantly serves 2 different sets of users: by default it is an 'install it and forget it', just works, and works very well. But if you really want to explore your options, switch to advanced mode, and there is really no limit on how intricate you want your configuration to be. 
 Far ahead of adblock, adblock plus and other similar projects.
-------------------------
default
Very impressed so far. I didn't have many slowdown issues with Adblock (Adblock Plus was really problematic for me, plus sellout-concerns), but the ones I had this fixed.

I'm not quite sure I am on board with the default loadout of blocks, because I also run Ghostery and I suspect the privacy-related stuff is superfluous as a result. Still, a very good extension and heartily recommended.
-------------------------
default
The only way I've found to watch videos, including and especially the live news broadcast on the WHIO ( https://www.whio.com/whio-tv/ ) website is to Allow w3.cdn.anvato.net within the uBO browser extension. My goal is to help make this viewable to all. I found the solution by becoming an "advanced user". Please make this allowable by default rules or filters in the next release. * Please note that many of us in the WHIO broadcast cannot receive a stable over-the-air television signal, and as such rely on the website to retrieve our news updates. If there is something I'm missing, please let me know at your earliest convenience. Thank you all so much for your hard work and dedication to this project! _

Hi, I appreciate this extension ALOT. Thank you. Is there a way to run uBlock OFF by default? As a webdev, sometimes I need to disable uBlock and it's a pain in the butt to manually do it every time I load a new page. Sometimes I forget it's on and I spend 20 mins debugging something when if I had turned it off it would've taken me 5. Thanks!
-------------------------

1. add button "undo recently added block rule". This is useful in case we didn't set a good rule after all, as it might have ruined the website a bit 2. Show visual list of what was blocked, to be able to unblock what we actually want This is useful even for cases that the default blocker has done bad things to how the website work. 3. Ability to reset all settings of current website. 4. report a website has bad behavior after using default blocking rules. This can help with others who might visit it.

Hey glad u are kin to work together to create a better uBlock/ uBlock origin:D 1. I use all ad blockers at default settings to test at the best and most fair level. 2. Webpages measures are all random but most frequents are google.com, youtube.com, hotmail.com etc. 3. Windows7 Profession with no bloatwares, viruses spywares just fully clean pc. Latest windows 7 updates to the best stability. Hopefully we will see a reborn UBlock from you:D

Add the following to your rules (My rules pane in dashboard): no-remote-fonts: * true This way remote font resources will be blocked everywhere by default, and you an allow on a per-site basis with the font button in the popup.

I try outlook.com with the default settings, and it works all fine as far as I can tell. What settings did you change from default settings?
-------------------------

@Raymond Hill I completely forgot this setting (on my win7 machine I unchecked it ages ago and since then I came to consider it as off by default). Chromium now closes all processes properly while Chrome leaves some behind still. I didn't mean to high-jack your thread for general browser maintenance, but thank you for taking the time to answer. that's very cool of you.

Youtube is HTML5 by default now, and the HTML5 player works fine with default uBlock settings.

Looks like all is working fine here using default settings + default filter lists.
-------------------------

I know that you have given us the per-site popup blocker button but would it be possible for you to give us an option to enable the popup blocker for all websites by default? I would rather selectively enable popups than to disable them for each sites. Your extension is truly the one and only. It gives us the total control of scripts unlike anything on the Chrome store.
-------------------------

Works fine for me using default settings. What filter lists do you have enabled? Enumerate all the settings which differ from default ones.

It would be great to get Chrome’s extension syncing capabilities into µBlock so we could sync our custom filters, filter lists and other settings across instances of Chrome. Here’s some documentation: http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage

Better than Adblock Plus. ABP is great especially combined with a browser with built in adblocking, but it only goes so far, there are still some ads that can get through them such as ones built into video player clients (no other adblocking method I've tried has been able to stop them besides uBlock Origin). uBlock also blocks other ads too, but I was mostly concerned with trying to get the ads baked into video players to go away.

DYNAMITE! This extension supremely exceeds my expectations. All I expected it to do when I first added it to my web browser was to just block annoying pop-ups but it also blocks my YouTube ads. Not only that, there is also a neat feature called "Block element..."! This may be TMI, but I had an assignment on Google Classroom from a previous semester which I wasn't satisfied with my grade, though my teacher would not let me redo it. Sometimes I would accidentally click on old assignments, and it the grade on that assignment still haunted me every time I saw it, even though it was from the past. I used the "Block element" feature to hide my grade and comments from my teacher on that specific assignment from my view. Bam! I don't have to see any unwanted negativity from the past. This extension is a MUST-HAVE! 😁

Thanks Raymond Hill for making this awesome extension. Super easy, configurable and less heavy on resources. It's sad to see Chrome finally going to make this extension unusable in few months. But till then I'll use it faithfully. Tried switching to Firefox for privacy but a lot of websites had very sluggish performance and it became quite unresponsive with a few sites. 

Thankfully, I got Steven Black host file installed to be prepared for the D-day. It is not as effective as uBlock Origin and doesn't block Google search ads, Youtube ads. But still it's working okayish.

-------------------------
chrome
I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about this extension sooner. AdBlock (and its various forks) have been quite useful over the years, but uBlock Origin is on another level.

The interface puts everything at your fingertips. Simply clicking the extension icon gives you access to a simple but powerful set of toggles, controls and statistics.

I particularly like the ease of access to features like the element zapper and the element picker. If you want to block something on-demand or build a custom rule, these features are huge. Toggles for JavaScript as well as for blocking popups, media, and/or fonts have been very useful to me in the past and I'm sure I'll use them in the future... however, this is the the first non-developer extension I've encountered that includes them all and right up front.

What's more, there's plenty more under the hood. For one, the built-in list of auto-updated filters are pretty thorough and, of course, there's the ability to import other lists. What led me to this extension was the inclusion of Fanboy's Cookie List (I've finally had it with all the cookie warnings) and uBlock implements the list exactly as advertised.

To be fair, a lot of the above can be accomplished with AdBlock. The difference is that uBlock does it in a considerably more intuitive way and it's more efficient. Even on a couple of older machines I'm using it on it's responsive and not bloating Chrome's usage of resources.

In the end, nothing is perfect and some of the controls that are in (or even buried in) the settings would be useful to have directly under the extension icon. But since the Chrome Web Store doesn't allow for a 4.75 star rating, the next closest rating is a full 5 stars.

You really can't go wrong with this. Low resource usage, effective ad-blocking, and a little bit of security on top of it all, blocking dangerous popups from running on your browser. They offer an easy-access method of allowing certain ads as well, to support sources that you believe deserve them. Overall, just easy to use, effective, and very minimal in it's footprint for being so effective. It beats out every competitor, in every way.

Just one of the best browser security tool, period. You cannot imagine just how some attacks are sophisticated nowadays and deployed on a large scale. Some of the nastiest malware are distributed on webservers and with javascript we leave the door open. Also thumbs up for the performance and customization available.

Install this on every browser you access. Make the world safer.

Ah, uBlock Origin. That little icon sits in the top corner, never getting looked at. Until you log on to a new computer for the first time and realise how much undesirable web content it manages to block. Adding this and Privacy Badger are my first two steps after opening a new computer's browser for the first time.

This is the best extension for Chrome that you should use. Stops junk ads, trackers, js miners, etc. If they were to perfect blocking malicious websites actions, this would be the only blocker you'd ever need.

I usually don't take the time to write reviews for browser extensions these days, but for gorhill's extensions, as an IT Security guy, I'm making an exception, because he has been a rock solid, consistently trustworthy and capable extension developer for several years now, and I would probably just flat out quit using the web if I didn't have tools like his uBlock Origin and uMatrix extensions on my browser's side to let me keep the garbage littering the internet today out of my machine. I do not browse without these extensions, and it's likely that I never will again. These tools are that necessary in today's world because the bad guys and the "not bad" bad guys have so ruined the internet today.

Raymond Hill is a true internet hero.

uBlock is an amazing blocker that'll block just about everything you come across. Pair it with uMatrix, and you'll be protected against scripts as well.

Keep in mind, uBlock lost support for blocking YouTube ads a while back, so you will need to pick up a separate YouTube ad blocker on the Chrome Web Store.

Great little add-on. Better than the bloated ABP. So good that I use it on my mobile browsers as well. 5 stars.
-------------------------

Best adblocker for your browser!
-------------------------
chrome
Does what it says on the tin. There are several different ad blocking extensions and programs out there, but this is the best one you can get from the Chrome Web Store due to it's great features and nearly undetectable impact on system performance across several devices.
-------------------------
chrome
Improves Chrome performance because of the minimal resource footprint. It works great out of the box, but for experienced users, uBlock Origin provides extremely granular filtering of web content. Opensource. Two thumbs up!
-------------------------

Blocks ads really well and speeds up the browser considerably.  Makes "smooth scrolling" better too.   Very good.
-------------------------
chrome
best adblocker for chrome. blocks everything. stupid random tabs/new windows. scripts.

First fell in love with this wickedly excellent extension using FF. Now, I've added it to Chrome. It is indispensable in any supported browser, its effects immediately tangible, and it just might drive curious users to discover more about what goes on behind all the glossy webpages we are served day after day. Many Thanks to Raymond Hill for this powerful tool!
-------------------------
browser
Great program. Speeds up the browser by knocking back the ads.
-------------------------
browser
I used ADB for years, but it stopped working and the performance hit was always meh. I'm very happy with uBlock Origin -- strong filters, strong performance.
I'm a big fan of its ability to pause links that redirect you to ad middlemen. A normal and rarely dangerous thing, but it's nice to have full control over my browser.
-------------------------
browser
Like the extension and have also added the extra ublock to chrome browser.
-------------------------
browser
Have been using uBlock Origin forever and never have had my browser hijacked or setting changed. It works perfectly and is the one of the few that is light on PC and didn't sellout to ad companies. 
Check if there is false from your AV and maybe you installed a different version or have a virus who is masking as this extension.

This is a great chrome extension. Blocks advertisements and protects you from malicious websites.

one word is not just enough i found this is the best from chrome store.
  ui is outstanding.........
totally magnificient, sprb

I don't know if I got a pre configured one but I synced Chromium on my Pi to the Chrome on my PC and this little add on came with and it only struck me today how I have gotten no pop up windows or anything since then and honestly this might be the best and most powerful popup and add blocker I have ever had the pleasure of using. Good job to the team behind this and thanks a ton!

Needed an open source replacement for no script on Chrome and my first impression is that this utility is every bit as capable as no script. Actually it is more intelligent it seems out of the box.

The good
• I love it. It is owned and supported by a friendly community. Not a corporation. More secure because its code is publicly available for review and contributions on GitHub at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
• Easy to use. With both basic or advanced modes.
• Lightweight on memory and CPU resources
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome
• Clear Manifesto:
......• The user decides what web content is acceptable or not in their browser.
......• The uBlock project does not support Adblock Plus' "Acceptable Ads Manifesto", because the "Acceptable Ads" marketing campaign is really the business plan of a for-profit entity.
......• Users are best placed to know what is or is not acceptable to them. uBlock's sole purpose is to give users the means to enforce their own choices.
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome.
• Lots of features
• uBlock Origin has a better track record at fully protecting your privacy, than AdBlock Plus (ABP). There is a controversy around ABP and its related for profit corporation trying to monetize ABP via ad whitelisting. Which means that corporation sales your privacy for profit :( Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adblock_Plus#Controversy_over_ad_filtering_and_ad_whitelisting

The bad
• Confusion with the names. Between "uBlock Origin" and "uBlock". For those not familiar with those names, uBlock Origin is better than uBlock. Mostly because as of May 2017 Ublock Origin is still actively maintained and updated. Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin#uBlock_.28ublock.org.29uBlock Compare to uBlock which as not been maintained and updated for more than 2 years, since 2015, and is trying to monetize an open source project.

I've used this ad blocker on Firefox, and now on Chrome; and it is by far the best ad blocker available.
-------------------------

Awesome extension,must have , beats adblocker and others,provides malware and ransomware protection for your browser..
-------------------------
chrome
As has been mentioned earlier, this is a FAR better extension than Adblock Plus because:

* it's smaller
• it's faster
• it requires less memory
• it doesn't hang or crash Chrome

I use it in conjunction with another extension called "Disconnect". Here is an article (for techies) with a head to head benchmark test demonstrating why uBlock is far superior to ABP.

This is the best adblocker out there. Not only does it block ads, but it also protects you from phishing sites and sites that might give you malware.

It’s very easy on the CPU; it doesn’t slow down my browser in the slightest.

I recommend this extension to you if you:
• Are human
• Use the Internet
-------------------------
chrome
Absolutely the best ad blocking extension out there for Google Chrome!
-------------------------
chrome
THE BEST option for ad blocking ever! I've tried them all folks...nothing beats this, especially the built-in sync feature. Something that is lacking in every other Chrome ad blocker!
-------------------------
browser
UBlock Origin is currently the best overall set-it-and-forget-it ad blocker/general-purpose blocker browser extension with the lowest RAM and CPU usage in my opinion, and it is the only one that I have used so far that can block most annoying pop-up ads.

Keep up the good work,

Was an adblock plus user (which is very good) but this is better (it amazes me the amount of junk it filters out. Works seamlessly with chrome beta. Supposedly uses less memory and cpu resources which might be valuble on older slower systems. Es Bueno!
-------------------------
chrome
I have tried a ublock (original !)several times and always uninstall frustrated with lack of any simple, user-friendly tutorial. Numerous features such as icon that mouse over says is Element Picker. I can pick element but don't know what to do then. I can't replicate which buttons took me to a blog or forum with long "Notes" or Log page strings of code  and alternate backend modifications information. Click the support tab next to this Review tab. Then page down and read the posts. If you understand the questions and appreciate the responses go forward with installing this.

Chrome store description seems like a very good product..  If you're a mid level  Firefox user I recommend going back to Adblock. 

I am an intermediate level Windows and Firefox user and familiar with support and  how to pages.
-------------------------
browser
you're a legend brother, keep up the good work. I dare not imagine going back to a browser experience without this extension/addon. This is one extension that is worth being paid for/donated to. However in saying that I wouldnt have the finances to donate at the moment but you can be sure that when I do, you'll be receiving a nice sum for all the headaches that you've helped me avoid.

This is the best one I ever tried, adblock, adblock plus is hell, they dont block any ads and Browser so fast without adblock and  ublock dosen't need any memory.
-------------------------

This is hands down the best ad blocker for chrome I have used. It is a breeze to set up and is very good at what it does. I see no slowdowns in page loads and the extension somehow manages to use VERY LITTLE memory and cpu.

Must have for any browser.

I must say that this extension immediately increased my browser experience on my Asus Flip 2 GB model.
-------------------------

Slim down all the crap your browser is told to download by the sites you're visiting. Great for users more comfortable tweaking settings as well as those who just want a cleaner surfing experience. 

For those in the latter category: be prepared for more interaction with your browser as you may find videos, images, comment sections, etc., not loading like you're accustomed to. 

Once you learn the ad block way, you can never go back. 

Want to support sites by allowing ads? Whitelist them.
-------------------------
browser
Not on my computer.  Which browser do you use?  I know it doesn't work well with UC Browser for PC because they have their own built in ad blocker.  But it works perfectly in Chrome, Firefox and Opera.  It blocks every ad in my browsers. It's 110x's better than ABP which was once my favorite.
-------------------------

I won't visit a website without this running. Essential part of the browser these days.

It's honestly the best adblocker for chrome. Everything else just consumes excessive memory.

-------------------------
browser
This addin give you more than just an add blocker - advanced users can control / block many aspects of the browser interaction.
-------------------------
browser
This is the best browser extension of all time.  

There is no reason to worry about granting full permission for uBlock to monitor everything.  It's an open source project, everyone can examine the code and see for themselves what's going on.
-------------------------
chrome
The best extension of its kind I 
have used for both Chrome & Firefox,without a doubt.
-------------------------
browser
Trust me I have tried them all on every different platform and browser. uBlock Origin not only does a better job at blocking ads than all others, but also uses far less system resources than the likes of adblock plus etc.. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
-------------------------
chrome
Better than all other adblockers I've tried.  uBlock Origin does the job perfectly and uses so little resources, you don't notice it being there.  It also starts up much faster in Chrome compared to the other popular adblockers.  Very rarely needs turning off, as 99.9% of sites work absolutely fine with it.  uBlock Origin also enhances privacy (not just by blocking ads), so another good reason to add it to Chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
Both Adblock and Adblock plus have recently failed for me.

This software restores full protection from having my bandwidth hijacked for ads and other purposes that I both don't want and don't authorize.

The others are sellouts.
This open source. This is the real deal and closest to Noscript for chrome.

I heard that uBlock Origin was less resource hungry than other adblock plug-ins, so I gave it a try. Wow, it completely blew me away. It effectively blocked out all kinds of ads. Even Pandora ads are blocked. The other plug-ins don't do that. I love it so much that I installed it on all my browsers.
-------------------------

This is the best browser firewall available.  Hands down!

Smaller and less memory and resource demand than ABP, works well, takes control of my browser back. This is MY computer again.

I find that this is currently the best ad blocker that I have used in Chrome. It blocks all of the ads for me in YOU-TUBE, which has proved useful when watching some of the longer documentary videos in there, and I find I have no problems with ads in Websites. Highly recommended.
-------------------------
chrome
This is officially my favorite adblocker for Chrome. It's compatible with ADP filters, and hasn't broken any site compatibility.
Also, idk what's with the complaints about Twitch; it works on my end.
-------------------------
chrome
uBlock Origin works good like Adblock, so I would recommend either uBlock or Adblock. 

Sometimes users need to switch back and forth between good apps from time to time, e.g. Firefox and Google Chrome.

Choice is good.
-------------------------
browser
The best adblock I've every used. 30MB of RAM vs over 100MB for ABP and doesn't slow down the browser like other extensions.

New icon looks quite ugly though.

Excellent work, gorhill. Immensely appreciated :)

Edit: I'm not worried about the new permissions because this is an opensource extension so you have access to the code to see exactly how the permission is used.
-------------------------
browser
Awesome work. I love that this is open-source, and it doesn't slow down my browser.

Gorhill and the ublock dev team are amazing. Fantastic extension. Run it with ghostery and chrome is still fast and light (light as chrome can really be)

I've been using AdBlock for a year and finally switched due to my subscriptions not loading properly in YouTube. Well this extension fixed all of that and Chrome runs quite a bit faster now. Very good extension I recommend that you switch or at least try it out if you're using AdBlock or AdBlock Pro.
-------------------------

Fastest ad blocking extension out there. I'm amazed that at the same settings as competition, my Chrome is performing noticeably faster.

Best ad blocker I know! It's lighter than AdBlock Plus, and it doesn't take bribes from Google and Microsoft like AdBlock Plus does!

Please uBlock, make a version of your extension for Firefox and MS's new Spartan browser. Now that AdBlock Plus has a bad reputation because of this dishonest bribery thing, it's the perfect time for uBlock to expand!
-------------------------

Even better than ABP for Chrome. Lean and mean.

By far the best ad blocker for Chrome. Much lighter than Adblock (Plus) both objectively and subjectively, without sacrificing functionality. The author deserves only superlatives.

If you are being redirected to sites it may block the site... Again you can turn off Ublock Origin from any site by doing what I described above. This is the best blocker out there!

The only way I've found to watch videos, including and especially the live news broadcast on the WHIO ( https://www.whio.com/whio-tv/ ) website is to Allow w3.cdn.anvato.net within the uBO browser extension.

Please make this allowable by default rules or filters in the next release. * Please note that many of us in the WHIO broadcast cannot receive a stable over-the-air television signal, and as such rely on the website to retrieve our news updates. If there is something I'm missing, please let me know at your earliest convenience. Thank you all so much for your hard work and dedication to this project! _

Usually works perfectly, but it's allowing some ads on gmovies.is while using Chrome. It blocks them all just fine using Firefox. Not sure how they are getting through on that site. I haven't whitelisted anything. With all other streaming sites it works great...

I have found a site that blocks the on-site blocking and shows ads regardless of settings. Can you please look how this is made and block it? thanks. I have comodo dragon, which is chrome.

Buonasera. Ho installato Ublock origin per il browser Google Chrome sul mio macbook.

Al instalar WebClipper y el complemento uBlock Origin (SIN IMPORTAR EL ORDEN), al activarse en Chrome, causan conflicto con los menu contextuales. Es decir, el menú de uBlock se antepone al de WebClipper, y la única manera de que webclipper funcione es des-habilitando el menú contextual en la configuración de ublock origin. Alguna variable compartida deben estar usando ambos y habrá que solucionarlo. Saludos.

Yes. I have used it for over a year on FireFox without any issues. I just reinstalled Chrome after several years and I considered this extension mandatory against popups (I also use ABP). Also, it is very easy to use.

So I guess the issue is just that Chrome granulates its permission system finer hence it asked explicitly for these 2 permissions. It might be a good idea to note this problem on the main page so users can be informed right away. Thanks for the good work. Have a fantastic 2016, Raymond!

I know that you have given us the per-site popup blocker button but would it be possible for you to give us an option to enable the popup blocker for all websites by default? I would rather selectively enable popups than to disable them for each sites. Your extension is truly the one and only. It gives us the total control of scripts unlike anything on the Chrome store.

1. Can you please add an option to pause µBlock in the button-submenu? I'm not talking about disabling µBlock for certain sites. I'm talking about disabling it on a temporary basis. So I can check if a filter causes issues. 2. The original AdBlock for Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom has a very neat way for handling filters and exceptions. May you please have a look at it and work on this, if you have the time?

One of the best privacy extensions, it blocks unnecessary scripts with potential privacy leaks very efficiently.
Even if you accidentally open a blocked script, it warns you and lets you allow a specific URL temporarily or permanently if you need it.
I have been using it for more than two years; when it caused the issue, I contacted support on Github, and they were very responsive.
They helped me solve the issue and quickly deployed the solution to the production environment.
-------------------------

THE BEST! NO DOUBT! HANDS UP! AND HANDS DOWN! And I assure you this is not a "paid for" or robo- generated comment about a fake or phishing "ad-blocker". This one is the REAL DEAL worth any donation, because it continues to be thoughtful enough to be free and not like other softwares, forcing you into a monthly fee while selling you data and probably more taxing to your cpu. that anywhere near this fine extension!
-------------------------
data
It works perfectly! It's heavily customizable and very versatile as not just an adblocker, but also a tool to hide various annoying prompts, like cookie prompts and newsletter signups. It even blocks pop-ups saying to disable adblockers. It also can be used to save data by blocking large things like autoplaying videos and 4K images, helping sites load faster and lowering the internet bills.
-------------------------
sell
Best adblocker available to download. If this ever goes paid I will absolutely buy it. Ontop of blocking ads you can also zap certain webpage elements which is PERFECT for when social media sites like twitter ruin the UI as you can just remove that part completely. They also don't sell your info like adblock plus does.

The best adblocker on the market by far.

Very low memory footprint, properly block 95+% of ads, has custom ads blocking, UI is very intuitive if you need to activate ads for a specific website or change some settings.

What about AdBlock Plus? They are now selling whitelisting, so advertisers are paying to go through the adblocking. Screw that!

Thankfully uBlock Origin isn't doing any of that crap (so far), its record is 100% clean, perfect for me.

It is a nice adblocker, I used to have adblock plus and they now SELL ADS exclusive to their users, therefore using them to milk out revenue. This adblocker is actually honest and isn't like abp. It is a adblocker but with way more features. it dosen't only block ads, but it blocks malware and tracking aswell.

The best ad-blocking software. Easily modified in the options, with lots of custom blocking lists than can be used together.

Ublock Origin.  Tried most (all?) other adblock solutions, it seems.  This is the only one that works ok on "Distrowatch".

Reliable, Fast and and thorough! uBlock Origin is seriously one of the best add-ons you can get for a browser and should be running on everyone's internet browser. It doesn't get in your way and block the websites you want to access [unless they're actually malicious] like other AdBlocker services do.
-------------------------
light
This from my experience is the greatest ad block extension available, you can filter for what you want manually, or add in bulk by copying filter lists, allowing for great versatility over other ad block software I've tried, it's also a relatively light extension as far as high end ad block extensions come, so that's another big plus, I can't fault Ublock-Origin at all, it's a must.

It does everything that it says it does. Doesn't slow down my PC at all. And best of all, ITS FREE!!!

I use a LAN level micro-server to block about 90% of ads on my network, but the few that manage to slip through are always caught by uBlock Origin. I've used it for as long as I can remember, and it's still the best in my honest opinion. 10/10 would recommend
-------------------------
fast
I used to use AdBlock until I recently came across this blocker and I LOVE IT its extremely fast and best part is that it isn't detected by any sites I love it!

This is 100% my favorite extension. Firstly, it does its job, and does it very well. Secondly, it stays fast no matter what page I use it on, and if the page wants me to turn off adblock, I'll just leave. Finally, you shouldn't mistake looks for function. This extension works like a charm and it does everything it said it was going to do. Thanks for this, it's made my browsing much better.

In short terms, the best ad blocker I have ever used. It blocks every ad I've seen so far, and it doesn't slow down Chrome at all. A must have, for sure.
-------------------------

I feel so gobsmacked that I didn't come across this much earlier. I had been using adblock, and pop up blocker for so long. I didn't realise that there was a free app that would  not only do both, but also do it better while consuming 100mb less RAM (That's for my tablet though, maybe it's different for others)

I am not a tech savvy person, so I don't know much about the trackers, and all that stuff. You'll have to check other reviews for that one.  

But from whatever little knowledge I have, this is a must must have extension. Now, I will install this on my other computers as soon as I get done writing this review. 

Absolutely great job by the Devs. Thank you.

By just using it a few minutes I can already tell this is my new adblocker. I was in my fury using three of the classic adblockers before this one, at the same time. But since they still let some annoying ads through and let a website seemingly mine my CPU I had enough and went looking for something exactly like uBlock Origin. It'll be only days and everyone I know will be using this one too. Thanks!

This is still by far the best straight ad-blocker

• It uses significantly less CPU and memory resources than ABP, AB or Adblock Edge (check the µBlock github wiki page for benchmarks). The codebase is brand new, and openly developed on Github.

• It blocks as well or better than these do.

• It doesn't track you like AB does.

The developer is very friendly and active (as well as being open about his intentions), also check out his more detailed blocking extension, HTTPSwitchboard. An amazing extension!

The good
• I love it. It is owned and supported by a friendly community. Not a corporation. More secure because its code is publicly available for review and contributions on GitHub at https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
• Easy to use. With both basic or advanced modes.
• Lightweight on memory and CPU resources
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome
• Clear Manifesto:
......• The user decides what web content is acceptable or not in their browser.
......• The uBlock project does not support Adblock Plus' "Acceptable Ads Manifesto", because the "Acceptable Ads" marketing campaign is really the business plan of a for-profit entity.
......• Users are best placed to know what is or is not acceptable to them. uBlock's sole purpose is to give users the means to enforce their own choices.
• More than 12 million users. Including 3.8+ millions users on Firefox and 8.9+ millions users on Chrome.
• Lots of features
• uBlock Origin has a better track record at fully protecting your privacy, than AdBlock Plus (ABP). There is a controversy around ABP and its related for profit corporation trying to monetize ABP via ad whitelisting. Which means that corporation sales your privacy for profit :( Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adblock_Plus#Controversy_over_ad_filtering_and_ad_whitelisting

The bad
• Confusion with the names. Between "uBlock Origin" and "uBlock". For those not familiar with those names, uBlock Origin is better than uBlock. Mostly because as of May 2017 Ublock Origin is still actively maintained and updated. Source at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin#uBlock_.28ublock.org.29uBlock Compare to uBlock which as not been maintained and updated for more than 2 years, since 2015, and is trying to monetize an open source project.

Skynet level efficiency, Terminator level blocking!

All with incredibly low system resource footprint- save power and free up your CPU cycles!

This is the ad-blocker you want!  
Best browser-level ad-block I've seen. Install and it works. With an additional 60 seconds you can configure it and subscribe to more known & maintained ad-network lists. On top of this, it's one-click-easy to backup & export your settings and subscriptions in case you need to import them to another PC.

If you aren't using this, walk away from your PC...

Based on what I've read about this, including recommendations from web anonymity and security researchers, I'm glad to have it. I switched from Adblock which worked well (not perfectly) and I'm already appreciating uBlock's features. However, I knew it was going to be perfect when I saw it was from the same developer as uMatrix, which allows blocking of elements of a website based on type (script, cookie, image…) and/or source domain, and also uses lists to block all elements from ad/malware domains. It by default blocks certain elements from all external domains, although all default rules are fully editable. Speed and flexibility of the visual interface to change site rules is notable. This 'matrix' also allows us to see what is going on on the webpage- how many X from domain Y being allowed/blocked. Both uBlock and uMatrix are strongly recommended though uBlock for *everyone* and uMatrix if you're a technophile and/or especially care about minimising your footprint online. uBlock is for everyone because I don't think anyone likes ads, especially these days when they are more aggressive, even on very respectable websites. The reduced memory use and marketer tracking are two other major reasons, if you're not convinced.
-------------------------
long
I didn't think there'd be a difference between this one and the other one I'd used for so long (can I say the name? hmm. rhymes with Bad Plock Fluss.)

Yes! Big difference. uBlock rocks it. Does so much more, smoother, better, easier to use.

I have tried a ublock (original !)several times and always uninstall frustrated with lack of any simple, user-friendly tutorial. Numerous features such as icon that mouse over says is Element Picker. I can pick element but don't know what to do then. I can't replicate which buttons took me to a blog or forum with long "Notes" or Log page strings of code  and alternate backend modifications information. Click the support tab next to this Review tab. Then page down and read the posts. If you understand the questions and appreciate the responses go forward with installing this.

Chrome store description seems like a very good product..  If you're a mid level  Firefox user I recommend going back to Adblock. 

I am an intermediate level Windows and Firefox user and familiar with support and  how to pages.

If you don't like rough (ugly) interfaces, this adblocker is not for you. However, it's actually so fast that it speeds up your browsing experience and it does an amazing job. Bonus: it's not maintained by a company with conflicting interests, as many other (good) ad-blockers actually are.
-------------------------

Dropped Adblock and Adblock plus. No matter what those extensions did not filter harmful clickbait and hidden ads on certain sites. This does the trick. Even if the downloaded list of filters doesn't catch everything, it's built in element picker (which lets you get rid of elements on a webpage) catches everything and anything. 
Honestly, adblocker and its plus cousin had faulty element pickers which is why I dropped them. This is light weight, effective and more efficient. Thank you!

Ad Blocker is clunky, the amount of times I've had slow loading of pages with "waiting for ad blocker" at the bottom and then I noticed it wasn't dealing with pop ups and letting YouTube ads through so I wondered what the point of it was.  Someone mentioned this on a friend's facebook thread so I went for it and I've never looked back.  It's pretty cool, no need to know lots of scripting and you can block certain parts of a page as well.  It's also great with shutting down those annoying new tab ads that certain sites have started doing now.

Really small, fast, and works extremely well, the "turn off" button is also very intuitive. I really hope this stays simple and doesn't get bought out to show specific apps like other blockers have.

Omg! I too forgot how fast chrome can be!  I was blaming it for hesitating and running slow and all along it was adblock plus doing it! Ublock, I LOVE U!

Fast but overly zealous blocker. Blocks much more than ads, like Google Analytics, Google and Facebook-based single sign-ons, etc.

I just want an ad blocker.

It's good;  And its definitly quite a bit faster.  Howerver it breaks a lot of websites.  If you're not paying attention or not thinking about it, the web page you're looking for won't be loading or won't be working properly; and this guy is the culprit.

Definitely light on CPU and works great except when it works too great.

I've been a long time ad muncher user(10+ years)& although other alternatives like abplus have come to the scene it never had the power of AM. After putting it to test after reading rave reviews about it, I'm more than convinced that this is the real deal. ★★★★★ Stars

Really great. People will scoff at the idea of a low-memory, low-cpu, ad blocker. As a chrome extension this is exactly what you want. I run a lot of extensions so saving memory and cpu at any point is awesome.

Really good! Seems to have increased my browsing speeds compared to AdBlock Plus. Also blocks all Ads which is awesome as well.

We use QuickBooks Online and have UBlock Origin enabled on Chrome. I get timed out of QuickBooks Online after 1-hour and have to redo MFA again. I should only have to do MFA once, as long as I do not clear cookies. Does anyone know what scripts I need to unblock to stop getting into this MFA loop? Any help is greatly appreciated!

Hi, First off, thank you for this incredible extension, it's easily the best ad-blocker I've ever used. But I have a website that won't let me read its content unless I disable it. I don't want to do that because the site then takes much longer to load etc. I was thinking you could develop a "light" or "incognito" mode that blocks the maximum number of elements without being recognized.

Could we please get the option to use asterisks in cosmetic filters? I've noticed a lot of websites using random characters to defeat filters. If I could simply swap part of them out for an asterisk, this could be fixed. If this would use extra CPU resources, I'd be happy for at least the option. Thanks.

Dear gorhill, I'm a long time user of your extension and I really admire and appreciate your work on uBlock. The things I like the most about uBlock over other extensions are its performance, low memory usage and extensions to the EasyList grammar which makes it really powerful especially for blocking anti-adblock contents. Currently you are including some of your rules and replacement contents namely resources.txt, filters.txt and badware.txt as static assets as part of your extension itself. Since the replacement resources in resources.txt are highly effective in dealing with anti-adblock scripts, I'm wondering if you are willing to host them as part of other crowd-sourced filters like EasyList so that the community can contribute more replacement scripts for anti-adblock detection scripts and it could potentially be used by other extensions as well. Please let me know your thoughts on this suggestion. Thanks, K'vel

Hi, My apologies if this question/topic has already been disused, I've tried to find, but I couldn't. Please answer to the next three questions. I will number them to be easier for you to answer: 1. Referring to used hardware resources (CPU) which of the above two alternatives is better to use: -All Fanboy lists + All EasyLists OR - Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List 2. Referring to number of blocking lines which alternative of the two ones is more often updated and have more blocked lines? -All Fanboy lists + All EasyLists OR -Fanboy+Easylist-Merged Ultimate List ? 3. Is it better to use both of the two alternatives regarding the first two questions? Thank you very much.

Appreciate the work.

The reason why I wanna give it 5 stars is because it blocks YouTube ads as-well, while most of the YouTube ad blockers don't actually work. This app still doesn't really block all the website ads and would love to see that in the next update but honestly overall good work team. kudos. :)

I've switched from using Brave to Microsoft Edge Chromium (due to the fact that Edge uses less resources than Brave and is faster than the former) and had added Adblock Plus, but it turned out to be a huge memory hog. A friend recommended Ghostery, which is remarkably lightweight and blazing fast. It blocks all ads and trackers on websites, and I've yet to encounter a broken site. Thanks!
-------------------------
block
I like the interface and how you can see how many trackers are spotted.
Try for fun pausing ghostery on some sites and you will see how the number of trackers increases because in blocking mode Ghostery sees how many trackers the site itself uses. But whe those trackers are allowed to do their thing they all sneakily invite their friends and you end up with a higher tracker-count. And now we know why some sites are so slow.
I love Ghostery for this. It protects me and also tells me what is going on.
-------------------------

Great! Blocks ads on Youtube- works well. 10/10. If you're looking for an adblocker this is the one for you!
-------------------------
block
Works just as intended. Sometimes it'll block something that's a pop-up but not a malicious one, like the smaller pop-up Google Translate on websites in other languages. But you can click a button where it'll tell you that it blocked the pop-up and to simply click there to allow it if you're looking for a fix. Also one of the only extensions I've found that offer Anti-Tracking, Ad-Blocking, and a Smart Blocking option all for free! Would recommend.
-------------------------
block
After a long time, I found out a perfect ad blocker with tracker blocking. This is the only ad blocker which also prevents "disable adblocker" pop unders from popular websites. I can finally browse internet without ads and without warnings from websites about using ad blocker. Thenk you team Ghostery for creating such an awesome extension.

Very useful and cookie/ads selective app that can be tailored to your needs. It has a comprehensive and itemised list of tracking cookies/ads that can be 100% blocked on all sites, or on the site of your choice or white-listed altogether. Remember that all other ad block apps do it in a blanket manner either blocking everything or upon disabling it, they allow all third party ads & cookies to pop up. Ghostery is a gem of an extension/app. Highly recommended.

Loved it till
 But today I have checked that it Doesn't Block YouTube Video ads. :(

Edit: Fixed! Now it works like a charm. Can you add "Block Element" option in ghostery, it will be really helpful for all of your users like ME!

It's a nice tool to see what's going on behind your back, because, you are, to the companies that "spy" on you, more or less anonymous. Many people who installed this are hoping to be ads-free on the net, but to them i can recommend this extension IN ADDITION to some great ad-blockers, that are script-blockers. A few good of those is AdBlock, AdBlock Plus (béta), FlashBlock, etc. Pick a good one that has options that you can set webpages as you want on that domain, they even block ALL ADS like on YouTube, or other video sites that got those annoying loud ads. They are the past with them. For your privacy traces, is suggest another very great extension, and that's Click&Clean, it has tons of possibilities, to see everything in Chrome, or your computer. You get 1 button, click on it, and you can manage everything about Chrome, record things, take snapshots, etc, etc. But the best thing is it's main reason for you, and that's CLEANING your surf TRACES, CLEANING ALL or ONLY THE RANDOME COOCKIES, KEEP ALL IMPORTANT YOUR PASSWORDS, FORM DATA, and erase things you want. It also has a great option, where you can click on what, how, when to clean-up. Even when you close Chrome, it then asks remove history, etc.? All with a memory. BUT KEEP GHOSTERY, because who's SPYING ON YOU, those scripts aren't blocked that easy. Because you DON'T SEE THEM, so it doesn't annoy you, but they are there. And GHOSTERY will pinpoint them out for you! Read GHOST. FAQ, and you'll find it all out very easy! Thank you, GHOSTERY, to keep guard for us, and telling us who's peering, spying on us all!!! Succes!!


I have to reload every page suddenly to activate Ghostery. It blocked adds on sites like YT, but now i have to activate Ghost on every page. It was such a good app. Why change it when everything works perfect...

Works great! I would recommend this extension to everyone.
Ghostery block all the malvertising and trackers those usually blocked by my anti-malware(Malwarebytes). but now Ghostery blocked all of them first that it does not notify my anymore. What a nice extension to put my mind at ease when browsing sites. Good job!

I have used several "blocking" software/extensions/apps and this is by far the best - well done guy's, fantastic. I am probably doing something wrong,  but I don't seem to be able to whitelist domains like Channel4 that detects it and will not play catch-up/on demand TV unless I manual pause it, but love the option you can select how long to pause as I don't have to remember to resume Ghostery when done on that domain.

I love this! If you use a regular ad blocker, some websites make you whitelist them, but Ghostery completely avoids this!!! It also gives the user full control of what things will be blocked and what pages will block trackers. It is amazing.

I've been using Ghostery ever since I heard about it a while back, Countless and unimaginable amounts of data and time have been saved because of Ghostery. Successfully allowing the marketers I am wanting to ALLOW vs them not having permission and still placing themselves thru a backdoor cookie, the intrusion and data pulled across so many layers of digital unknowns. (It's disturbing to find out the $ value for just one person on one website;if being specific one of the big players says you are worth exactly $13.00. So, I am happy that this exists. Perhaps a pizzagate preventing script could be  on the horizon expanding Ghostery's capabilitys. Id love to have it prevent me from reading fake news stories. False information = 0 ... This is art in its highest form. Smart technology that is worth the investment to use. Couldn't say enough kudos to the men and women who work and continue to work on this. Thanks folks. Keep up the good work.

I Love Ghostery. My Only request is that I would like to see Ghostery play just a little bit better with other Ad blocking extensions. Ghostery, & my other extensions they sometimes cancel each other out. When that happens I get a extension error alert/message. (((It's Not a big issue with me, but still))). On the Plus Side I think both Ghostery, & the one other ad blocker extension (((that will remain nameless))) both together stopped those annoying YouTube, & Ustream ads/Commericals COMPLETELY. I haven't seen a single ad/commercial in about a year now. That in itself is AWESOME! 5 stars. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. :)

I use it on MacBook, Windows, and the iPhone version. ALL ARE GREAT!!

Just have to enable tracker blocking. It defaults to NO blocking, in case some users are not aware of this.
-------------------------

Hate the new update. I printed few things and every page has ghostery's circle of number of trackers blocked. 

I really wished ghostery remained the same and not get any NEW update. Alas it did. Good bye ghostery you were amazing...
-------------------------
block
Love the recent update-categorizing trackers by classification--makes it easier for me to know which tracker should I block or not.
-------------------------
block
I've been using Ghostery for a long time and IMHO, this is the best version of the extension yet.

The new bigger panel makes it easier to see at a glance what trackers are present on the current website and it's also easier to check/uncheck blocking options.

The developers have also added the ability to see which blocked tracker is causing a web page not to function correctly.

That is a huge improvement over previous versions because it could take quite a long time to check/uncheck/reload the page to see which trackers, of which there are many on some websites, need to be unblocked for the web page to display correctly.

I wouldn't go anywhere on the web without this extension being loaded and active in my brower.

Just Block It!

Forgot it was running, love that it keeps out junk trackers. Be sure to edit the settings to turn off its tracking and turn on blocking of trackers.

awesome....can block anything

Works great. click settings then visit the options button to block everything. all doubleclick, google connect, beacons, widgets, all ad's,
analytics, privacy, thousands of others. The only 4 I keep open are for audio/music.  A must have!  Adblock 4 is great too if it's still around.  Blocks all ads on youtube and other streaming video!  Just like the old days before mega-data was a thing and then the ads came along for the ride.
-------------------------
block
This is a Ghostman and no one can defeat this, because it's invisible from their eyes! It blocks all of those junk analytical, advertisement tools which we don't need! And ofcourse increase the speed.
-------------------------
block
Amazing.  
I saw this extension reviews and had to get it.
I was shocked to see how many sites are tracking my every move, even after choosing "opt out" with Google.

I would like to see an "auto add" feature, so that I didn't have to manually flip the switch every time the program finds a new tracker.

And also, if you already have a tracker blocked, I would like that tracker to NOW show in the list of trackers blocked (it's a pop up window).

I still give it 5 stars because I can now have control who does and doesn't see me!

Just get this...seriously that good!
-------------------------
block
Used this in another browser and got very used to it just blocking all the crap. Thanks!
-------------------------

holy furballs... i can block ads WITHOUT being known i'm blocking ads! for instance, a resource website for gaming, they slow down people with ad blockers, i go there and BAM! no ads, no warning about adblocker, I will finally be able to save some data! great job, ghostery!
something that i'd love to see is an option to narrow down ads. We don't wanna starve off websites, do we? but if you could block ads that are deemed "obnoxious" and keep the non-obnoxious ads, it'd be great! i absolutely love this! works like a assasin rather than a viking!

It's clean and simple but there are a LOT of popups, scripts and ads that are not blocked and it doesn't have the functionality to add custom or external filters.

It's excellent and it really does what it says. However sometimes it is unable to block graphical ads on manga/video streaming sites without you manually intervening. But rest 99% bam! Spot On! Also one should be careful to specify a certain ad which needs to track you, example pizza delivery and stuff. Other than that, it's pretty slick!

Great app for blocking all the annoying advertisement

You will be AMAZED at how much insidious tracking is being done on your browser activity by 100's and 100's of trackers, beacons, and stuff I didn't even know existed. This app blocks ALL of it, and makes it easy to select exceptions on the fly. This is one of the absolute best apps for any browser, and my advice: don't even think about getting on the web without it.

I add this extension to every computer I use. It is the best protection I have found short of TOR.

Love it!  I can custom design which apps I want to allow and block all the others.  It is awesome!  I've been sng  it for quite a few years now, both on Chrome and Firefox.

I should have installed this ages ago! Ghostery gives users total control over which trackers to block, lets you individualize rules per domain or per tracker and it shows all the trackers available.

The app is very transparent, the UI is intuitive and the tutorial explains all the features. I'm keeping this.
-------------------------
block
I feel much safer on the web now.

This privacy (and ads if you want) blocker is a very smart tweak to the general third-party blocking concept. And this one is very well implemented too! Lots of easy-to-use options to customize it to work just the way you want.

Honestly, one of the best extensions I've seen in awhile. A lot of extensions are useful but cludgy or missing that little extra polish. This one has it all.

Kudos!

I was wondering how Ghostery Inc. profited from a free extension so I looked up the company on Wikipedia. It's a double edged sword; on one hand it keeps your activities from being tracked on the other it collects data of what is blocked and sells that data to ad agencies so they can better understand what people prefer to block and not block.
-------------------------
block
Works OK, but no custom URL blocking, and no way to submit URLs to the developers for analysis? Come on, peeps.

Most amazing extension I have seen so far on chrome. I went on a site that had a small Facebook button. I clicked on my new Ghostery extension and blocked the Facebook tracking. I then reloaded, and looked at the Facebook button again. A little Ghost figure rested over top of the button with a little X-out sign next to it. This is only more proof that this works and is effective. I have other ad tracking viewers and when I disable the tracking site on this app the site on the other app disappears. GET THIS NOW.

Fantastic to have a free application that allows you to block unwanted viewers from sites you visit.

Great extension which has certainly improved over the years. Upgraded my review from 3 to 5 stars.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: It's a helpful Extension, however it doesn't seem to block all the trackers every time and I often see the box show multiple ones left uncrossed. Please fix this because I added Ghostery to block ALL the trackers, not just some of them.
-------------------------

Just awesome!  
It feels like I'm learning more about websites everyday with this thing.
Easy interface- just click what you want blocked or not.
Works great as its own browser on my phone, too.

It's really useful in blocking pop-up ads and youtube ads.I really like it because it's simple to setup to your preferences.

Excellent tool for both blocking tracking sites and web application pop-ups. Easy to configure if the default are not to your liking and anything it adds to the browser can be hidden or removed.

I have used Ghostery for about 6 months now and love it. Ghostery gives you so much control over what you do or don't want to see. Site loading and flash players both go quickly and smoothly now. I initially started using Ghostery because I was tired of the ongoing competition between ads and my flash player over loading time. I was getting choppy flash player display whenever a new ad would load. You can choose exactly what you want to block and Ghostery regularly updates the bug list. You can see exactly what scripts are being blocked on each site (if you want) and what type of information they are meant to collect. The biggest plus for me about Ghostery is that you don't even notice it's there except for the lack of flashing banners and obnoxious auto-audio in video ads. It is the silent guardian of your internet browser. You have the option to get more notifications about activity if you want, but for people like me that just want a bit of peace from the advertisements, it does all of the work without bragging about it. After using it on my home computer for a couple of weeks, I went ahead and added Ghostery to my work computer as well, with equally satisfactory results. I highly recommend this program.

Done the job it was meant to do really well. Be careful with it as it can sometimes reduce certain websites functionality if you block certain things. Does the job it was meant to.

THE "FREE" VERSION" - ALTHOUGH LIMITS YOU TO NOT THE ENTIRE VARIOUS WORLDWIDE SERVERS THAT THIS USES, IS REALLY GREAT BOTH ON MY PC & MY ANDROID CELL. JUST AN ALL AROUND PLUS AND WAS A REAL EYE OPENER TO ACTUALLY SEE JUST HOW MANY ITEMS YOU DO ON A DAILY BASIS, THAT JUST IN FACT THERE ARE SO MANY WATCHING EYE'S ON YOU, JUST LIKE WLKING DOWN ONE MAJOR CITY BUSINESS AREA BLOCK, BY THE TIME YOUR HALF-WAY THRU THE BLOCK, YOU HAVE BEEN LIVE FEEDS OF YOU MORE THAN LIKELY AT LEAST 50 TIMES BY GOD ONLY KNOWS.

An outstanding tool that seamlessly blocks more crap (technical term) than you can imagine.  Blocks beacons, advertisements, flash, and many other technologies that are taken advantage by malware creators.
-------------------------
block
You must first set it up to block all through the * button - not obvious but it works. Then you can review each blocked tracker and decide if you actually want it blocked. Some video content will not run unless you allow the track - same with ads. I have other ad-blockers installed in Chrome which are now dormant as Ghostery reacts faster than they do. Get it! Ghostery is well worth the learning curve.
-------------------------

Very Handy app to weed out all the bloatware cookies that can slow down a site loading whilst your browsing it can also with one click allow the background software and adware cookies that is helpful to remain and not keep asking you if you wanna block them so i like it its surprising how many programs use background software that is no good to you or you just dont need them anymore!

The best- awesome how it tells you who's tracking you and what type they are. Works beautifully! How wonderful to know that the trackers are now unable to track you anymore-thanks to Ghostery!

A little problem- sometimes there are little extension errors if you already have AVAST  online protection. Sometimes Ghostery overpowers it a little. Your settings icon will flash orange, but that's it. If you ignore it, nothing will happen! That's all, nothing much.

It is very much recommended!

I highly recommend Ghostery. I'm a tad OCD and I researched and tried a lot of privacy extensions like NoScript, DoNotTrackMe and Disconnect before deciding that my fave was Ghostery. If you feel annoyed about all the companies and even stats-obsessed bloggers aggressively tracking you, this is a must-have extension (and if you're not that concerned about your privacy, your loss bc a tracker+cookie can reveal A LOT about you). Subscribing to EasyPrivacy List or Fanboy Annoyances/Social List through ABP is not enough. You need an extension to be able to block everything and control what you block. Ghostie blocks pretty much everything for me (though I feel like it works even better in Firefox) and I can allow certain widgets I use frequently, like disqus and soundcloud, and whitelist certain sites I trust. I would recommend you turn off the alert bubble and choose "block new elements by default". If Ghostery blocks too much stuff for you, just toggle off blocking on widgets. Overall, great, easy-to-use extension.

Best thing that could have happened to my browser. It always makes me smile when I see hundreds of different trackers being blocked on the sites I visit.

Not only does it seem to comprehensively block the most annoying parts of the web, it also provides valuable insight and education into exactly what these trackers do, thereby giving the user actionable intelligence to make the decision whether or not to opt-in to the third-party service.

Brilliant and works. According to FAQ it makes pages load faster when blocking enough.
-------------------------
block
While no anti-tracking tool is perfect, you can at least make it more difficult for the would-be trackers to profile your browsing behavior. 

The interface is clean, polished, and intuitive. You can always temporarily pause blocking if you find a certain site's functionality is reduced. You can also whitelist sites you trust. Since new trackers are always being created, the app auto-updates the blacklist periodically (though you can disable this if you want). It also seems to work well with other plugins.

I find Ghostery, Adblock Plus, and ScriptSafe (along with some common sense) are the most essential plugins for safe browsing and eliminate 95% of the most annoying parts of browsing the web.

Ghostery made my life a lot easier. It can block unwanted tracking scripts, provide insights i.e., it provides me control.

This extension is amazing. I use it as an adblocker even sites such as pandora that tell you to upgrade to remove ads doesn't have ads. It can be as basic or as complex as you want. I recommend taking the time to adjust the settings when you first get it. 

WORD OF CAUTION!!! 
DO NOT GO IN AND BLOCK EVERYTHING. SOME SITES REQUIRE TRACKERS TO RUN PROPERLY. YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF LOGGING IN CONSTANTLY OR NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE SITE AT ALL. YOU WILL BE SEEING THE NUMBERS 404 VERY OFTEN. 

Just basicly know what you are doing when you block stuff and you should be fine.

This is wonderful. It would help me if  you were to write some background on your views of the different sorts of trackers -- are there any that I might want to keep on, that do me or the world some good and don't invade my privacy? I don't have a deep understanding of them and have just turned them all off (with the understanding that I can click-to-play where it blocks content I might want to see). But some better analysis of what the different kinds of trackers are about would be helpful.  Anyhow, a great product, thank you.

Never thought there would be an extension like this out there. Ghostery performs a very welcomed service.

This is an amazing little app. It truly blocks all of the tracking software that normally loads in the background without your knowledge while surfing the internet.

You have to first make some easy setting changes then this becomes an awesome tool.

1 - Under General/Trackers to block: Block everything

2- Under Advanced:

Excellent. Blocks ads, blocks Facebook from tracking you across the web, blocks Olark popups, and more!

I rarely give five star reviews, but this app is fantastic. I've worked in IT for years, but even for me it is amazing to see just how much information is being scraped with every page one visits. Even if you opt not to view what dinguses are trying to grab your information, this app works just great in invisible mode, blocking the scrapes. However, if you want to look deeper into the chasm, turn on the notifications and enjoy learning who the background players are, like the special features on your Blu-ray movie. A must have.

So far so good. Didn't know there were that many invisible trackers out there. I'm letting the app basically do it's default blocking until or if I run into any problems..This will be a 5 if all remains well.
-------------------------

Great app, and I love the fine-grained control over which type of trackers it blocks. I especially like that it shows you what specifically it blocks, but it always bugged me that the shortest time you could set the popup to display for is 3 seconds. 

If anyone else is having the same problem, you can fix this by going into the options page for the extension, clicking "Inspect HTML element" over the dropdown where you choose the time to display for, right-clicking the highlighted HTML element in the source editor and selecting "Edit HTML", replacing the number with your desired time, and hitting "Save Options" at the bottom of the page. Presto! As much control over the display time as you want!

Enlightened, finally. Forewarned is forearmed.

So far as I can tell, this ext has kept a keen watch on all sorts of prying eyes trying to follow, map, catalog, and analyze my webehavior. 

Not only is it very good at finding the newest snitches on the block, it's very easy to control who's allowed access, who's not, etc., in 4 distinct categories of snoopery. 

This superb app works as advertised and is a force multiplier when used in combination with one or two related extensions (Collusion Graph is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for educational purposes; however, the magnitude of the prying and spying is spectacular in a "Nazi mass gathering in Nürnburg in the '30s" sorta way.

It would be nice if the descriptions also listed the sites that the tracker came from and those it is going to affect if blocked. In addition it would be nice if there were a place to type in a site you are having trouble with to see if it has been reported to cause a problem and what one should unblock to use it.In a perfect world if a block were to cause a problem,a pop-up would tell us what we would need to unblock in order to use.Thank-you an eye-opener.

This is the best way to detect 3rd parties and hidden items performing tracking on a web site.

The only thing I don't like about it is that it cannot currently tell the difference between opt-out cookies and id cookies.  

This would be a nice feature, and it would be even nicer if it could "lock in" opt-out cookies and detect when a company does not obey their opt out cookie and  allow you to notify the company (in case it is a rouge affiliate) and the service boards they belong to.

Ghostery is an innovative product that provides more real-time privacy protection from the emerging invasive technologies being deployed all across the web.  It took me a while to understand what Ghostery does but once I figured it out I am now committed to using it.

My primary criticism of Ghostery is that it assumes that users know a lot more about tracking technology than many of us do.  I consider myself much more knowledgeable in such matters than the average web surfer, but some of Ghostery's terminology was new to me, making it difficult for me to make best use of the product until I took time to educate myself (mostly elsewhere).

Hopefully the publishers will take this to heart and make Ghostery more friendly to those of us new to the world of the devious tracking technologies.

That said, I congratulate the publishers for a fine product that works well and performs an important task that seems to have no competition in the usually crowded field of software development.

First, my friends and I love your program. Kudos for such an inventive, practical, clean and neat way to browse without being spied upon. My suggestion is this: more often than not (read: all the time), I unblock a site to get so one segment or another of it and then FORGET TO REBLOCK or restart Ghostery blocking. Sometimes for DAYS.So, if you had a switch that once activated by the user, would re-activate Ghostery's blocking, voila!, I don't have to remember to do it and one less thing to remember is a good thing. Thanks again for a wonderful and wonderfully useful program.

Ghostery blocks some players by default these are described as widgets - use the setting in ghostery to enable some of the 'widgets' on the page and reload - the pages own player should play - it is really important to go through ghosterys settings and really get to grips with them.

Great product by the way. Help me understand why I turning off Ghostery is necessary to see the pictures on this HomeDepot site.

Works just as intended. Sometimes it'll block something that's a pop-up but not a malicious one, like the smaller pop-up Google Translate on websites in other languages. But you can click a button where it'll tell you that it blocked the pop-up and to simply click there to allow it if you're looking for a fix. Also one of the only extensions I've found that offer Anti-Tracking, Ad-Blocking, and a Smart Blocking option all for free! Would recommend.

Hi, this is a message to let our users know we now offer a paid subscription option with additional features we think you guys will really enjoy. If you wish to continue using the free version of Ghostery, this is still available with the same great features we have always provided.

It's a nice tool to see what's going on behind your back, because, you are, to the companies that "spy" on you, more or less anonymous. Many people who installed this are hoping to be ads-free on the net, but to them i can recommend this extension IN ADDITION to some great ad-blockers, that are script-blockers. A few good of those is AdBlock, AdBlock Plus (béta), FlashBlock, etc. Pick a good one that has options that you can set webpages as you want on that domain, they even block ALL ADS like on YouTube, or other video sites that got those annoying loud ads. They are the past with them. For your privacy traces, is suggest another very great extension, and that's Click&Clean, it has tons of possibilities, to see everything in Chrome, or your computer. You get 1 button, click on it, and you can manage everything about Chrome, record things, take snapshots, etc, etc. But the best thing is it's main reason for you, and that's CLEANING your surf TRACES, CLEANING ALL or ONLY THE RANDOME COOCKIES, KEEP ALL IMPORTANT YOUR PASSWORDS, FORM DATA, and erase things you want. It also has a great option, where you can click on what, how, when to clean-up. Even when you close Chrome, it then asks remove history, etc.? All with a memory. BUT KEEP GHOSTERY, because who's SPYING ON YOU, those scripts aren't blocked that easy. Because you DON'T SEE THEM, so it doesn't annoy you, but they are there. And GHOSTERY will pinpoint them out for you! Read GHOST. FAQ, and you'll find it all out very easy! Thank you, GHOSTERY, to keep guard for us, and telling us who's peering, spying on us all!!!

I Love Ghostery. My Only request is that I would like to see Ghostery play just a little bit better with other Ad blocking extensions. Ghostery, & my other extensions they sometimes cancel each other out. When that happens I get a extension error alert/message. (((It's Not a big issue with me, but still))). On the Plus Side I think both Ghostery, & the one other ad blocker extension (((that will remain nameless))) both together stopped those annoying YouTube, & Ustream ads/Commericals COMPLETELY. I haven't seen a single ad/commercial in about a year now. That in itself is AWESOME! 5 stars. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. :)

It's clean and simple but there are a LOT of popups, scripts and ads that are not blocked and it doesn't have the functionality to add custom or external filters. Some non-intrusive ads on facebook and yahoo appear to be whitelisted. I'm also very suspicios of the high ratings here, there are many better and non-proprietary extensions available.
-------------------------

I love this thing and use it religiously but please please could the developer remove the installation survey, having it get in the way several times a day when I log in to different computers in the open plan office gets annoying really quickly, anything that could be done to sync settings across devices would also be a major plus!

All my other extensions seem to be much more streamlined in their installation and sync at least the majority of their settings requiring only a quick 1-2 click selection at most.

Ghostry blocks so many ads, pop-ups and unwanted scripts that load in background that now it saves huge amount of bandwidth. Mostly when am on youtube, the autoplay of ads before you can skip it to actual video is saving almost 8-10GB of bandwidth every month! Kudos to Ghostery team

annoy
Only using it for the 2nd day but so far, so good-  it's good to see that those annoying trackers can't get past this protective layer that actually appears to function properly without interfering with my browsing capabilities, and hogging up RAM... thanks, Ghostery!
-------------------------
popup
I have been using this plugin with Google Chrome for over 90 days now, and I am thoroughly impressed. Some of my favorite news websites, unfortunately, seem to have the most advertisements and pop-ups creating a slow and frustrating reading experience.

Ghostery has fixed this issue. At the click of a button the annoying ads and popups where gone, and the best part is that Ghostery remembers your settings for the site so you do not need to shut the ads down on your next visit!

As an IT Support and Computer Repair technician I spend a lot of time working with software. Ghostery is one of the rare applications that really delivers! I give Ghostery a thumbs up.
-------------------------
annoy
I highly recommend Ghostery. I'm a tad OCD and I researched and tried a lot of privacy extensions like NoScript, DoNotTrackMe and Disconnect before deciding that my fave was Ghostery. If you feel annoyed about all the companies and even stats-obsessed bloggers aggressively tracking you, this is a must-have extension (and if you're not that concerned about your privacy, your loss bc a tracker+cookie can reveal A LOT about you). Subscribing to EasyPrivacy List or Fanboy Annoyances/Social List through ABP is not enough. You need an extension to be able to block everything and control what you block. Ghostie blocks pretty much everything for me (though I feel like it works even better in Firefox) and I can allow certain widgets I use frequently, like disqus and soundcloud, and whitelist certain sites I trust. I would recommend you turn off the alert bubble and choose "block new elements by default". If Ghostery blocks too much stuff for you, just toggle off blocking on widgets. Overall, great, easy-to-use extension.
-------------------------
annoy
EDIT: after I got ghostery again(switching browsers), I was a bit annoyed at it showing in the bottom right corner. Then I figured out that when you see the alert bubble you can change the options from there immediately. Just save it and that's it.

Ghostery is awesome, I love it! Simple and easy to use interface/settings that work without confusion unlike Disconnect.(Disconnect confused me)
-------------------------

Not only does it seem to comprehensively block the most annoying parts of the web, it also provides valuable insight and education into exactly what these trackers do, thereby giving the user actionable intelligence to make the decision whether or not to opt-in to the third-party service. This extension gives control back to the user, plain and simple.
One of the most useful chrome extension. You'll be shocked at how many sites and ad services are tracking you!
-------------------------
annoy
Best for blocking trackers and other annoying stuff.
-------------------------
annoy
While no anti-tracking tool is perfect, you can at least make it more difficult for the would-be trackers to profile your browsing behavior. 

The interface is clean, polished, and intuitive. You can always temporarily pause blocking if you find a certain site's functionality is reduced. You can also whitelist sites you trust. Since new trackers are always being created, the app auto-updates the blacklist periodically (though you can disable this if you want). It also seems to work well with other plugins.

I find Ghostery, Adblock Plus, and ScriptSafe (along with some common sense) are the most essential plugins for safe browsing and eliminate 95% of the most annoying parts of browsing the web.

The default settings can be a bit annoying because it will show pop-ups telling you everything it's doing but the UI is easy to navigate and turn them off/on to your liking.

Great app, and I love the fine-grained control over which type of trackers it blocks. I especially like that it shows you what specifically it blocks, but it always bugged me that the shortest time you could set the popup to display for is 3 seconds. 

If anyone else is having the same problem, you can fix this by going into the options page for the extension, clicking "Inspect HTML element" over the dropdown where you choose the time to display for, right-clicking the highlighted HTML element in the source editor and selecting "Edit HTML", replacing the number with your desired time, and hitting "Save Options" at the bottom of the page. Presto! As much control over the display time as you want!

Can't say enough .. 
Great add on, stupid simple to install, works with several browsers of your choice.  Had popup that nothing could find or permanently stop (viper, malwarebytes, spybot SD, HighJackThis).
Well enabled ghostery blocking .. wallaa... Awesome.
-------------------------

It would be nice if the descriptions also listed the sites that the tracker came from and those it is going to affect if blocked. In addition it would be nice if there were a place to type in a site you are having trouble with to see if it has been reported to cause a problem and what one should unblock to use it.In a perfect world if a block were to cause a problem,a pop-up would tell us what we would need to unblock in order to use.Thank-you an eye-opener.
-------------------------

Amazing extension. I only use a few extensions (and have tested over 100 throughout my time switching from Firefox to Chrome) and this made the cut. It performs exactly what it states that it will do, no more and no less; which sadly is more than you can say for a lot of extensions throughout many different browsers. The popups did get annoying but eventually I turned them off and sometimes I do mess around with it because it can become very useful. It is easy to add a website to the whitelist so you can keep their trackers running -- and again there are only a few sites out of the many I visit that I allow them to use their tracker(s) - I find this extension very useful and it would receive a 5 star rating and will as soon as or if they do change their popup feature to be more user friendly and not as annoying as it currently is when turned on.
-------------------------
popup
Great extension, simply and easily blocks trackers. Like the pop-up that tells me what sites are tracking on a given page AND lets me easily find out more information about those trackers! Bonus for being multi-platform and multi-browser. If you value your privacy this really is a must-have extension.

I've been using Ghostery for a long time and IMHO, this is the best version of the extension yet.

The new bigger panel makes it easier to see at a glance what trackers are present on the current website and it's also easier to check/uncheck blocking options.

The developers have also added the ability to see which blocked tracker is causing a web page not to function correctly.

That is a huge improvement over previous versions because it could take quite a long time to check/uncheck/reload the page to see which trackers, of which there are many on some websites, need to be unblocked for the web page to display correctly.

I wouldn't go anywhere on the web without this extension being loaded and active in my brower.

Essential app to help you take back control of the data you that you constantly leak to online businesses, but does it in such a way that it is also beneficial to businesses!! A Win-Win-Win! My only Annoyance is that it opens up the ghostery Welcome Page on every load of chrome...

Ghostry blocks so many ads, pop-ups and unwanted scripts that load in background that now it saves huge amount of bandwidth. Mostly when am on youtube, the autoplay of ads before you can skip it to actual video is saving almost 8-10GB of bandwidth every month! Kudos to Ghostery team

Most amazing extension I have seen so far on chrome. I went on a site that had a small Facebook button. I clicked on my new Ghostery extension and blocked the Facebook tracking. I then reloaded, and looked at the Facebook button again. A little Ghost figure rested over top of the button with a little X-out sign next to it. This is only more proof that this works and is effective. I have other ad tracking viewers and when I disable the tracking site on this app the site on the other app disappears. GET THIS NOW.
-------------------------
fix
Great extension which has certainly improved over the years. Upgraded my review from 3 to 5 stars.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: It's a helpful Extension, however it doesn't seem to block all the trackers every time and I often see the box show multiple ones left uncrossed. Please fix this because I added Ghostery to block ALL the trackers, not just some of them.
-------------------------
bug
I have used Ghostery for about 6 months now and love it. Ghostery gives you so much control over what you do or don't want to see. Site loading and flash players both go quickly and smoothly now. I initially started using Ghostery because I was tired of the ongoing competition between ads and my flash player over loading time. I was getting choppy flash player display whenever a new ad would load. You can choose exactly what you want to block and Ghostery regularly updates the bug list. You can see exactly what scripts are being blocked on each site (if you want) and what type of information they are meant to collect. The biggest plus for me about Ghostery is that you don't even notice it's there except for the lack of flashing banners and obnoxious auto-audio in video ads. It is the silent guardian of your internet browser. You have the option to get more notifications about activity if you want, but for people like me that just want a bit of peace from the advertisements, it does all of the work without bragging about it. After using it on my home computer for a couple of weeks, I went ahead and added Ghostery to my work computer as well, with equally satisfactory results. I highly recommend this program.
-------------------------

super useful tool to gain 3rd party site visibility and control of their access to read your PI and write tracking or other code to your system without your permission.  My question is, how much of your personal info does Ghostery see?
-------------------------
stop
Gostery is wonderful.  Not only does it stop ads, (the boxes for the ads are still there, but all of the content, pictures and words are gone!) but it helps me learn about those who would made money by violating my privacy.  AND it does all this without slowing my system.  For me, this is a gift of the first magnitude!
-------------------------
fix
I have been using this plugin with Google Chrome for over 90 days now, and I am thoroughly impressed. Some of my favorite news websites, unfortunately, seem to have the most advertisements and pop-ups creating a slow and frustrating reading experience.

Ghostery has fixed this issue. At the click of a button the annoying ads and popups where gone, and the best part is that Ghostery remembers your settings for the site so you do not need to shut the ads down on your next visit!

As an IT Support and Computer Repair technician I spend a lot of time working with software. Ghostery is one of the rare applications that really delivers! I give Ghostery a thumbs up.

Very Handy app to weed out all the bloatware cookies that can slow down a site loading whilst your browsing it can also with one click allow the background software and adware cookies that is helpful to remain and not keep asking you if you wanna block them so i like it its surprising how many programs use background software that is no good to you or you just dont need them anymore!

The best- awesome how it tells you who's tracking you and what type they are. Works beautifully! How wonderful to know that the trackers are now unable to track you anymore-thanks to Ghostery!

A little problem- sometimes there are little extension errors if you already have AVAST  online protection. Sometimes Ghostery overpowers it a little. Your settings icon will flash orange, but that's it. If you ignore it, nothing will happen! That's all, nothing much.

It is very much recommended!

Tried several privacy/blocker extensions over the past week and found Ghostery to be the best for what it catches and for the great level of configurability.
Auto updating with auto-block and notification is really nice to have and Click-To-Play helps a lot to quickly find things that you want to unblock & gain access to.
Now I've got it installed on every pc at home and work.  Great tool guys!

Great extension! I like being able to see who's asking for my data on every page load. Nicely customizable.

Occasionally Google Calendar crashes while Ghostery is running, but I blame Google Calendar for that, not Ghostery.
-------------------------
error
I think Ghostery's great for what it does. I suggest all surfers of the net to use this. My two baseline security programs on my computer are Norton & Malwarebytes. The 3rd program that was suggested I install & use was Ghostery. Initially I went to Ghostery's main website to download this program. When I did I immediately received notification that it wasn't compatible with the version of Windows Explorer that's currently running on my laptop.
 The good thing is that I don't use Windows Explorer to surf the waves of the net. I use Google! So, remembering that there's a Ghostery app in the Google store I then added the Ghostery app to my Google and now I'm running the 3 main security programs my personal tech support suggested I run & use on my laptop. I'm extremely happy with the performance & level of security that I maintain on my now 6 month old laptop. Not a single problem! Not a single error! Not a single hiccup! I highly suggest running this app in conjunction to your other security programs and/or apps that you already run.

This extension is amazing. I use it as an adblocker even sites such as pandora that tell you to upgrade to remove ads doesn't have ads. It can be as basic or as complex as you want. I recommend taking the time to adjust the settings when you first get it. 

WORD OF CAUTION!!! 
DO NOT GO IN AND BLOCK EVERYTHING. SOME SITES REQUIRE TRACKERS TO RUN PROPERLY. YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF LOGGING IN CONSTANTLY OR NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE SITE AT ALL. YOU WILL BE SEEING THE NUMBERS 404 VERY OFTEN. 

Just basicly know what you are doing when you block stuff and you should be fine.

There is still hope when you see this good of an extension. too good to be true so hang on and lets see who gets the oooops!

break
This is the best ad blocker I have used. Yes some sites break, but it gives you the option to "Allow once" to get the page the first time and then most of the time that is sufficient. For sites that won't play you can allow individual exceptions. Updates itself regularly, Very easy to use. With 20 years in IT this is the BEST... so far!

I really would recommend it.

bug
Great app, and I love the fine-grained control over which type of trackers it blocks. I especially like that it shows you what specifically it blocks, but it always bugged me that the shortest time you could set the popup to display for is 3 seconds. 

If anyone else is having the same problem, you can fix this by going into the options page for the extension, clicking "Inspect HTML element" over the dropdown where you choose the time to display for, right-clicking the highlighted HTML element in the source editor and selecting "Edit HTML", replacing the number with your desired time, and hitting "Save Options" at the bottom of the page. Presto! As much control over the display time as you want!

Enlightened, finally. Forewarned is forearmed.

So far as I can tell, this ext has kept a keen watch on all sorts of prying eyes trying to follow, map, catalog, and analyze my webehavior. 

Not only is it very good at finding the newest snitches on the block, it's very easy to control who's allowed access, who's not, etc., in 4 distinct categories of snoopery. 

This superb app works as advertised and is a force multiplier when used in combination with one or two related extensions (Collusion Graph is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for educational purposes; however, the magnitude of the prying and spying is spectacular in a "Nazi mass gathering in Nürnburg in the '30s" sorta way.

Amazing extension. I only use a few extensions (and have tested over 100 throughout my time switching from Firefox to Chrome) and this made the cut. It performs exactly what it states that it will do, no more and no less; which sadly is more than you can say for a lot of extensions throughout many different browsers. The popups did get annoying but eventually I turned them off and sometimes I do mess around with it because it can become very useful. It is easy to add a website to the whitelist so you can keep their trackers running -- and again there are only a few sites out of the many I visit that I allow them to use their tracker(s) - I find this extension very useful and it would receive a 5 star rating and will as soon as or if they do change their popup feature to be more user friendly and not as annoying as it currently is when turned on.

This is a really cool extension. . . Although I knew websites were collecting loads of information on me when I browsed, I never knew it was this much! I'm going to continue to use it on Chrome (which is my main browser) and on Firefox as well.

Thank you so much. 

To anyone who is interested in browsing the web without the web 'browsing' you this extension is for you. If you'd like to be as a ghost and flit in and out of websites without them knowing, install this and watch in wonder as all kinds of trackers are disabled.
-------------------------
access
Even in a world that seems hell bent on tracking what everyone does, it is nice to see that someone is into the opposite.  Too bad some websites refuse to allow access unless they can drop tracking cookies.

Thanks for allowing us who can barely afford the internet the ability to protect our privacy.  If only my ISP was as diligent.

Great work!!! Thank You!!

Very useful and cookie/ads selective app that can be tailored to your needs.

This is the best way to detect 3rd parties and hidden items performing tracking on a web site.

The only thing I don't like about it is that it cannot currently tell the difference between opt-out cookies and id cookies.  

This would be a nice feature, and it would be even nicer if it could "lock in" opt-out cookies and detect when a company does not obey their opt out cookie and  allow you to notify the company (in case it is a rouge affiliate) and the service boards they belong to.

Works just as intended. Sometimes it'll block something that's a pop-up but not a malicious one, like the smaller pop-up Google Translate on websites in other languages. But you can click a button where it'll tell you that it blocked the pop-up and to simply click there to allow it if you're looking for a fix. Also one of the only extensions I've found that offer Anti-Tracking, Ad-Blocking, and a Smart Blocking option all for free! Would recommend.

It's a nice tool to see what's going on behind your back, because, you are, to the companies that "spy" on you, more or less anonymous. Many people who installed this are hoping to be ads-free on the net, but to them i can recommend this extension IN ADDITION to some great ad-blockers, that are script-blockers. A few good of those is AdBlock, AdBlock Plus (béta), FlashBlock, etc. Pick a good one that has options that you can set webpages as you want on that domain, they even block ALL ADS like on YouTube, or other video sites that got those annoying loud ads. They are the past with them. For your privacy traces, is suggest another very great extension, and that's Click&Clean, it has tons of possibilities, to see everything in Chrome, or your computer. You get 1 button, click on it, and you can manage everything about Chrome, record things, take snapshots, etc, etc. But the best thing is it's main reason for you, and that's CLEANING your surf TRACES, CLEANING ALL or ONLY THE RANDOME COOCKIES, KEEP ALL IMPORTANT YOUR PASSWORDS, FORM DATA, and erase things you want. It also has a great option, where you can click on what, how, when to clean-up. Even when you close Chrome, it then asks remove history, etc.? All with a memory. BUT KEEP GHOSTERY, because who's SPYING ON YOU, those scripts aren't blocked that easy. Because you DON'T SEE THEM, so it doesn't annoy you, but they are there. And GHOSTERY will pinpoint them out for you! Read GHOST. FAQ, and you'll find it all out very easy! Thank you, GHOSTERY, to keep guard for us, and telling us who's peering, spying on us all!!! Succes!!

I have used several "blocking" software/extensions/apps and this is by far the best - well done guy's, fantastic. I am probably doing something wrong,  but I don't seem to be able to whitelist domains like Channel4 that detects it and will not play catch-up/on demand TV unless I manual pause it, but love the option you can select how long to pause as I don't have to remember to resume Ghostery when done on that domain.

I really like Ghostery. I use it on Chrome and Android. It has evolved really well through the years. I combine it with Adblock Pro (not AB Plus!!!) and between the two of them my internet time is a pleasure! 

I have had some recent issues where Ghostery borks the Adblock Pro extension and I have to go in and manually re-enable ABP. Not a big deal, but deduct a star for that.

Still, a great extension, especially if you take a little time to understand how it works and tweak your settings.
-------------------------

I've used Ghostery for quite a while.  I was in love with version 6 and tbh I was taken aback by the new UI.   But once I "got" the idea of the new interface it started working for me.

It is so simple!  You can simply turn off all trackers and Ghostery will tell you if the site is not working correctly ("broken pages") because of the trackers you've turned off and allow you to turn on just the trackers you need to get the site working.  Very cool.

There are some other features from v6 I'd like to see - like Beacons - but I hear they'll be back in a future version - all-in-all, this is a very good product with a simple, powerful interface.
-------------------------

Forgot it was running, love that it keeps out junk trackers. Be sure to edit the settings to turn off its tracking and turn on blocking of trackers.

Works great. click settings then visit the options button to block everything. all doubleclick, google connect, beacons, widgets, all ad's,
analytics, privacy, thousands of others. The only 4 I keep open are for audio/music.  A must have!  Adblock 4 is great too if it's still around.  Blocks all ads on youtube and other streaming video!  Just like the old days before mega-data was a thing and then the ads came along for the ride.

so much better with this extension.  ads are gone (never clicked on them anyway)...thank you for a fine product

Amazing.  
I saw this extension reviews and had to get it.
I was shocked to see how many sites are tracking my every move, even after choosing "opt out" with Google.

I would like to see an "auto add" feature, so that I didn't have to manually flip the switch every time the program finds a new tracker.

And also, if you already have a tracker blocked, I would like that tracker to NOW show in the list of trackers blocked (it's a pop up window).

I still give it 5 stars because I can now have control who does and doesn't see me!

Just get this...seriously that good!
-------------------------

holy furballs... i can block ads WITHOUT being known i'm blocking ads! for instance, a resource website for gaming, they slow down people with ad blockers, i go there and BAM! no ads, no warning about adblocker, I will finally be able to save some data! great job, ghostery!
something that i'd love to see is an option to narrow down ads. We don't wanna starve off websites, do we? but if you could block ads that are deemed "obnoxious" and keep the non-obnoxious ads, it'd be great! i absolutely love this! works like a assasin rather than a viking!

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  I run a cleaner program several times a day because I detest - and resent - all the crap that ends up on my devices.  Ghostery blocks an awful lot of garbage before it ships off my vital info to ....wherever it goes.
I like the app so well that I even sent them some cash.  No regrets!

I love this thing and use it religiously but please please could the developer remove the installation survey, having it get in the way several times a day when I log in to different computers in the open plan office gets annoying really quickly, anything that could be done to sync settings across devices would also be a major plus!

All my other extensions seem to be much more streamlined in their installation and sync at least the majority of their settings requiring only a quick 1-2 click selection at most.

This app is so good I would actually PAY for it (though I am quite happy to use it for free too!). It's like every web page I go to is ad free. An occasional ad here or there isn't bad, but nowadays it's like you have to search through the ads to find it. Ghostery works great in keeping the ads in check. For me, I just make sure I keep on the "widgets" but turn off all the tracking, advertisement and beacons. Very well done Ghostery team. I am curious to know however if turning off the various items also means that those items can't install cookies? My assumption would be that they can't since they can't see you.
-------------------------

Great tool for privacy!  Easy to use and you will be amazed, going from site to site surfing, how some sites only do some tracking, cookies, analysis, or advertising, WHILE OTHER SITES YOU VISIT HAVE 30 OR 40 THAT GHOSTERY SHOWS YOU AND THEY CAN EASILY BE TURNED OFF BY MOVING THE SWITCH!

In the never ending effort to keep "STUFF" off your computer Ghostery is outstanding.

It's excellent and it really does what it says. However sometimes it is unable to block graphical ads on manga/video streaming sites without you manually intervening. But rest 99% bam! Spot On! Also one should be careful to specify a certain ad which needs to track you, example pizza delivery and stuff. Other than that, it's pretty slick!

Couldn't imagine browsing without it. Widgets may not work on certain sites, but it is as easy as identifying which item is a beacon, advertising junk, or analytics anonymously collecting your browsing habits and allows you to turn that widget on to get full-site functionality. I recommend this with Ad-Block Plus and LastPass for a true "safe" browsing experience. Now if you are a "click happy" user....nothing will help you :)

Once I figured out how to turn off the alert bubble in the advanced settings now I really love this extension.  I hear other people telling me about how eerie the facebook ads they keep getting are BUT I don't get any of that crap thanks to Ghostery... Keep up the GREAT work team! :)
-------------------------

Most amazing extension I have seen so far on chrome. I went on a site that had a small Facebook button. I clicked on my new Ghostery extension and blocked the Facebook tracking. I then reloaded, and looked at the Facebook button again. A little Ghost figure rested over top of the button with a little X-out sign next to it. This is only more proof that this works and is effective. I have other ad tracking viewers and when I disable the tracking site on this app the site on the other app disappears. GET THIS NOW.

I have been using this plugin with Google Chrome for over 90 days now, and I am thoroughly impressed. Some of my favorite news websites, unfortunately, seem to have the most advertisements and pop-ups creating a slow and frustrating reading experience.

Ghostery has fixed this issue. At the click of a button the annoying ads and popups where gone, and the best part is that Ghostery remembers your settings for the site so you do not need to shut the ads down on your next visit!

As an IT Support and Computer Repair technician I spend a lot of time working with software. Ghostery is one of the rare applications that really delivers! I give Ghostery a thumbs up.

Very Handy app to weed out all the bloatware cookies that can slow down a site loading whilst your browsing it can also with one click allow the background software and adware cookies that is helpful to remain and not keep asking you if you wanna block them so i like it its surprising how many programs use background software that is no good to you or you just dont need them anymore!

I highly recommend Ghostery. I'm a tad OCD and I researched and tried a lot of privacy extensions like NoScript, DoNotTrackMe and Disconnect before deciding that my fave was Ghostery. If you feel annoyed about all the companies and even stats-obsessed bloggers aggressively tracking you, this is a must-have extension (and if you're not that concerned about your privacy, your loss bc a tracker+cookie can reveal A LOT about you). Subscribing to EasyPrivacy List or Fanboy Annoyances/Social List through ABP is not enough. You need an extension to be able to block everything and control what you block. Ghostie blocks pretty much everything for me (though I feel like it works even better in Firefox) and I can allow certain widgets I use frequently, like disqus and soundcloud, and whitelist certain sites I trust. I would recommend you turn off the alert bubble and choose "block new elements by default". If Ghostery blocks too much stuff for you, just toggle off blocking on widgets. Overall, great, easy-to-use extension.

This is wonderful. It would help me if  you were to write some background on your views of the different sorts of trackers -- are there any that I might want to keep on, that do me or the world some good and don't invade my privacy? I don't have a deep understanding of them and have just turned them all off (with the understanding that I can click-to-play where it blocks content I might want to see). But some better analysis of what the different kinds of trackers are about would be helpful.  Anyhow, a great product, thank you.

Great app, and I love the fine-grained control over which type of trackers it blocks. I especially like that it shows you what specifically it blocks, but it always bugged me that the shortest time you could set the popup to display for is 3 seconds. 

If anyone else is having the same problem, you can fix this by going into the options page for the extension, clicking "Inspect HTML element" over the dropdown where you choose the time to display for, right-clicking the highlighted HTML element in the source editor and selecting "Edit HTML", replacing the number with your desired time, and hitting "Save Options" at the bottom of the page. Presto! As much control over the display time as you want!

Amazing extension. I only use a few extensions (and have tested over 100 throughout my time switching from Firefox to Chrome) and this made the cut. It performs exactly what it states that it will do, no more and no less; which sadly is more than you can say for a lot of extensions throughout many different browsers. The popups did get annoying but eventually I turned them off and sometimes I do mess around with it because it can become very useful. It is easy to add a website to the whitelist so you can keep their trackers running -- and again there are only a few sites out of the many I visit that I allow them to use their tracker(s) - I find this extension very useful and it would receive a 5 star rating and will as soon as or if they do change their popup feature to be more user friendly and not as annoying as it currently is when turned on.

Very useful and cookie/ads selective app that can be tailored to your needs. It has a comprehensive and itemised list of tracking cookies/ads that can be 100% blocked on all sites, or on the site of your choice or white-listed altogether.

I have used Ghostery for about 6 months now and love it. Ghostery gives you so much control over what you do or don't want to see. Site loading and flash players both go quickly and smoothly now. I initially started using Ghostery because I was tired of the ongoing competition between ads and my flash player over loading time. I was getting choppy flash player display whenever a new ad would load. You can choose exactly what you want to block and Ghostery regularly updates the bug list. You can see exactly what scripts are being blocked on each site (if you want) and what type of information they are meant to collect. The biggest plus for me about Ghostery is that you don't even notice it's there except for the lack of flashing banners and obnoxious auto-audio in video ads. It is the silent guardian of your internet browser. You have the option to get more notifications about activity if you want, but for people like me that just want a bit of peace from the advertisements, it does all of the work without bragging about it. After using it on my home computer for a couple of weeks, I went ahead and added Ghostery to my work computer as well, with equally satisfactory results. I highly recommend this program.
-------------------------
whitelist
This is a great app! The only thing I would like to see appear in a future update is the ability to sync the whitelisted trackers to your google account so that you can have the same setup on all devices.

I think Ghostery's great for what it does. I suggest all surfers of the net to use this. My two baseline security programs on my computer are Norton & Malwarebytes. The 3rd program that was suggested I install & use was Ghostery. Initially I went to Ghostery's main website to download this program. When I did I immediately received notification that it wasn't compatible with the version of Windows Explorer that's currently running on my laptop.
 The good thing is that I don't use Windows Explorer to surf the waves of the net. I use Google! So, remembering that there's a Ghostery app in the Google store I then added the Ghostery app to my Google and now I'm running the 3 main security programs my personal tech support suggested I run & use on my laptop. I'm extremely happy with the performance & level of security that I maintain on my now 6 month old laptop. Not a single problem! Not a single error! Not a single hiccup! I highly suggest running this app in conjunction to your other security programs and/or apps that you already run.

Great extension. Easy to see what's being blocked, and whitelist sites for local development. Pageloads are appreciably better.

While no anti-tracking tool is perfect, you can at least make it more difficult for the would-be trackers to profile your browsing behavior. 

The interface is clean, polished, and intuitive. You can always temporarily pause blocking if you find a certain site's functionality is reduced. You can also whitelist sites you trust. Since new trackers are always being created, the app auto-updates the blacklist periodically (though you can disable this if you want). It also seems to work well with other plugins.

I find Ghostery, Adblock Plus, and ScriptSafe (along with some common sense) are the most essential plugins for safe browsing and eliminate 95% of the most annoying parts of browsing the web.

This is a great app, I've tried a few of the tracker blocker apps and found this one better than all the rest, it picks up double the stuff that the others do and I find it real easy to use. I noticed another review on here by someone complaining that they found themselves constantly fiddling with the settings? I can only assume that they don't really understand browsers/apps because Ghostery is really very simple to use, easy to whitelist sites that you don't mind tracking you, even whitelist individual trackers. You can set it to show you as much or as little information you want from showing you every tracker on every site to  practically invisible. I can't recommend it enough, it's the best I've found.
-------------------------

Ghostery gives a fantastic level of control over what is being done with your sacred personal information. The whitelist feature lets websites that rely on legitimate 3rd party services work and being able to whitelist domains right from the toolbar is great.

It would be nice if the descriptions also listed the sites that the tracker came from and those it is going to affect if blocked. In addition it would be nice if there were a place to type in a site you are having trouble with to see if it has been reported to cause a problem and what one should unblock to use it.In a perfect world if a block were to cause a problem,a pop-up would tell us what we would need to unblock in order to use.Thank-you an eye-opener.

I've been using Ghostery for a long time and IMHO, this is the best version of the extension yet.

The new bigger panel makes it easier to see at a glance what trackers are present on the current website and it's also easier to check/uncheck blocking options.

The developers have also added the ability to see which blocked tracker is causing a web page not to function correctly.

That is a huge improvement over previous versions because it could take quite a long time to check/uncheck/reload the page to see which trackers, of which there are many on some websites, need to be unblocked for the web page to display correctly.

I wouldn't go anywhere on the web without this extension being loaded and active in my brower.
-------------------------
version
I've used Ghostery for quite a while.  I was in love with version 6 and tbh I was taken aback by the new UI.   But once I "got" the idea of the new interface it started working for me.

It is so simple!  You can simply turn off all trackers and Ghostery will tell you if the site is not working correctly ("broken pages") because of the trackers you've turned off and allow you to turn on just the trackers you need to get the site working.  Very cool.

There are some other features from v6 I'd like to see - like Beacons - but I hear they'll be back in a future version - all-in-all, this is a very good product with a simple, powerful interface.

I think Ghostery's great for what it does. I suggest all surfers of the net to use this. My two baseline security programs on my computer are Norton & Malwarebytes. The 3rd program that was suggested I install & use was Ghostery. Initially I went to Ghostery's main website to download this program. When I did I immediately received notification that it wasn't compatible with the version of Windows Explorer that's currently running on my laptop.
 The good thing is that I don't use Windows Explorer to surf the waves of the net. I use Google! So, remembering that there's a Ghostery app in the Google store I then added the Ghostery app to my Google and now I'm running the 3 main security programs my personal tech support suggested I run & use on my laptop. I'm extremely happy with the performance & level of security that I maintain on my now 6 month old laptop. Not a single problem! Not a single error! Not a single hiccup! I highly suggest running this app in conjunction to your other security programs and/or apps that you already run.

The Updated Version Is Even Better Than The Old:Always A good Thing.

Ghostery just continues to get better and better. More functionality, more VISIBILITY into what each tracking cookie is and is trying to do.  On/Off settings are much better in the latest version as is overall global control of cookie access..  keep up the great work guys!

This is one of the first extensions you install on your chrome browser. It is a must have for all privacy concerned folks. Thank you so much for this great extension. I have enabled sharing of my anonymous usage statistics for the improvement of this extension/community. I have no problem with that. Your recent feature addition to show trackers on google search result, is a big NO for me. Please dont enable this feature by default. Also provide us an option for us to disable on our current installs.
-------------------------

I use it on MacBook, Windows, and the iPhone version. ALL ARE GREAT!!

Just have to enable tracker blocking. It defaults to NO blocking, in case some users are not aware of this.
-------------------------
default
Easy to manage, leave the setting on default. Easy to use, once enabled Ghostery does the work and does it well. Thank you for keeping my privacy, private and the peace of mind I get from seeing all those trackers derailed
-------------------------
sync
I love this thing and use it religiously but please please could the developer remove the installation survey, having it get in the way several times a day when I log in to different computers in the open plan office gets annoying really quickly, anything that could be done to sync settings across devices would also be a major plus!

All my other extensions seem to be much more streamlined in their installation and sync at least the majority of their settings requiring only a quick 1-2 click selection at most.
-------------------------
default
Amazing piece of software.  I do wish they'd disable the alert bubble by default, NO ONE wants to see that every single time they navigate to a page.
-------------------------
default
Excellent tool for both blocking tracking sites and web application pop-ups. Easy to configure if the default are not to your liking and anything it adds to the browser can be hidden or removed.
-------------------------
sync
This is a great app! The only thing I would like to see appear in a future update is the ability to sync the whitelisted trackers to your google account so that you can have the same setup on all devices. Would highly recommend for anyone concerned about either 1) their privacy or 2) malicious websites.
-------------------------
default
I highly recommend Ghostery. I'm a tad OCD and I researched and tried a lot of privacy extensions like NoScript, DoNotTrackMe and Disconnect before deciding that my fave was Ghostery. If you feel annoyed about all the companies and even stats-obsessed bloggers aggressively tracking you, this is a must-have extension (and if you're not that concerned about your privacy, your loss bc a tracker+cookie can reveal A LOT about you). Subscribing to EasyPrivacy List or Fanboy Annoyances/Social List through ABP is not enough. You need an extension to be able to block everything and control what you block. Ghostie blocks pretty much everything for me (though I feel like it works even better in Firefox) and I can allow certain widgets I use frequently, like disqus and soundcloud, and whitelist certain sites I trust. I would recommend you turn off the alert bubble and choose "block new elements by default". If Ghostery blocks too much stuff for you, just toggle off blocking on widgets. Overall, great, easy-to-use extension.
-------------------------
default
Excellent function, but setup could have better defaults out of the box.
-------------------------
default
imo ghostery is much better than donottrackme and it is more concise in firefox than chrome ... wish all the blockers were enabled by default though, you do need to make sure you configure it after install and select update elements automatically in advanced settings
-------------------------
default
The default settings can be a bit annoying because it will show pop-ups telling you everything it's doing but the UI is easy to navigate and turn them off/on to your liking.

An absolutely brilliant little thing. Very easy to use and does what it says.
-------------------------
default
You have to first make some easy setting changes then this becomes an awesome tool.

1 - Under General/Trackers to block: Block everything

2- Under Advanced:
Uncheck "Show Alert Bubble"
Check "Block new elements by default"
-------------------------
default
So far so good. Didn't know there were that many invisible trackers out there. I'm letting the app basically do it's default blocking until or if I run into any problems..This will be a 5 if all remains well.
-------------------------
sync
Sync all settings to an online provider. Better than an import/export option...
-------------------------
sync
Google chrome allows storing extension settings in chrome.store, which get synced across browsers. Please implement support for this. Otherwise a great extension.
-------------------------
default
Ghostery blocks some players by default these are described as widgets - use the setting in ghostery to enable some of the 'widgets' on the page and reload - the pages own player should play - it is really important to go through ghosterys settings and really get to grips with them.

The best way to prevent your private data from leaking out of Chrome and into Ads.  This really works and I'm grateful that I found it.
-------------------------

It's a nice tool to see what's going on behind your back, because, you are, to the companies that "spy" on you, more or less anonymous. Many people who installed this are hoping to be ads-free on the net, but to them i can recommend this extension IN ADDITION to some great ad-blockers, that are script-blockers. A few good of those is AdBlock, AdBlock Plus (béta), FlashBlock, etc. Pick a good one that has options that you can set webpages as you want on that domain, they even block ALL ADS like on YouTube, or other video sites that got those annoying loud ads. They are the past with them. For your privacy traces, is suggest another very great extension, and that's Click&Clean, it has tons of possibilities, to see everything in Chrome, or your computer. You get 1 button, click on it, and you can manage everything about Chrome, record things, take snapshots, etc, etc. But the best thing is it's main reason for you, and that's CLEANING your surf TRACES, CLEANING ALL or ONLY THE RANDOME COOCKIES, KEEP ALL IMPORTANT YOUR PASSWORDS, FORM DATA, and erase things you want. It also has a great option, where you can click on what, how, when to clean-up. Even when you close Chrome, it then asks remove history, etc.? All with a memory. BUT KEEP GHOSTERY, because who's SPYING ON YOU, those scripts aren't blocked that easy. Because you DON'T SEE THEM, so it doesn't annoy you, but they are there. And GHOSTERY will pinpoint them out for you! Read GHOST. FAQ, and you'll find it all out very easy! Thank you, GHOSTERY, to keep guard for us, and telling us who's peering, spying on us all!!! Succes!!


I have to reload every page suddenly to activate Ghostery. It blocked adds on sites like YT, but now i have to activate Ghost on every page. It was such a good app. Why change it when everything works perfect...

More speed would be a bonus guys if possible.

I really like Ghostery. I use it on Chrome and Android. It has evolved really well through the years. I combine it with Adblock Pro (not AB Plus!!!) and between the two of them my internet time is a pleasure! 

I have had some recent issues where Ghostery borks the Adblock Pro extension and I have to go in and manually re-enable ABP. Not a big deal, but deduct a star for that.

Still, a great extension, especially if you take a little time to understand how it works and tweak your settings.

I have to say that I think Ghostery is one of the best sites that I have ever worked with on my computer!  I am also giving it a 5 for the good work that it does.  I really can't think of anything bad happening.  I first became acquainted with the site on Firefox - then found that I could also use it in Microsoft and Chrome.  I like that you have choices in Settings that you can set up when you first download the site and then change any  of them after you have used the site and become acquainted with it.

This app by far exceeded my expectations.  I was having hidden malware in my Chrome browser that had been very difficult to keep at bay.

Ghostery is a very much appreciated and valued app for today's browsers.

This is one of the absolute best apps for any browser, and my advice: don't even think about getting on the web without it.

Most amazing extension I have seen so far on chrome. I went on a site that had a small Facebook button. I clicked on my new Ghostery extension and blocked the Facebook tracking. I then reloaded, and looked at the Facebook button again. A little Ghost figure rested over top of the button with a little X-out sign next to it. This is only more proof that this works and is effective. I have other ad tracking viewers and when I disable the tracking site on this app the site on the other app disappears. GET THIS NOW.

Best thing since sliced bread.  Well done.  Those trackers and advertisers have the delicacy of a herd of elephants, but now they are tamed.

I've switched to Firefox n Android, because it allows Ghostery - unlike Chrome, just for you!
-------------------------
browser
I have used Ghostery for about 6 months now and love it. Ghostery gives you so much control over what you do or don't want to see. Site loading and flash players both go quickly and smoothly now. I initially started using Ghostery because I was tired of the ongoing competition between ads and my flash player over loading time. I was getting choppy flash player display whenever a new ad would load. You can choose exactly what you want to block and Ghostery regularly updates the bug list. You can see exactly what scripts are being blocked on each site (if you want) and what type of information they are meant to collect. The biggest plus for me about Ghostery is that you don't even notice it's there except for the lack of flashing banners and obnoxious auto-audio in video ads. It is the silent guardian of your internet browser. You have the option to get more notifications about activity if you want, but for people like me that just want a bit of peace from the advertisements, it does all of the work without bragging about it. After using it on my home computer for a couple of weeks, I went ahead and added Ghostery to my work computer as well, with equally satisfactory results. I highly recommend this program.

GREAT Tracking cookie blocking extension for chrome! A Must have with adblock
-------------------------

Best blocker app I've used. I was concerned about the (rather ironic, IMO) tracking that Ghostery does on its users, but have since learned it's not a big issue (its anonymous aggregate data with the ability to opt-out if you wish). Especially considering how helpful the app is.
Browsing is a much more pleasant experience with this extension installed.

Wish it were available for Android, that would make all Chrome browsing ad and tracker-free!
-------------------------
browser
awesome plugin, just little heavy for my browser
-------------------------
chrome
You must first set it up to block all through the * button - not obvious but it works. Then you can review each blocked tracker and decide if you actually want it blocked. Some video content will not run unless you allow the track - same with ads. I have other ad-blockers installed in Chrome which are now dormant as Ghostery reacts faster than they do. Get it! Ghostery is well worth the learning curve.
-------------------------
chrome
I have been using this plugin with Google Chrome for over 90 days now, and I am thoroughly impressed. Some of my favorite news websites, unfortunately, seem to have the most advertisements and pop-ups creating a slow and frustrating reading experience.

Ghostery has fixed this issue. At the click of a button the annoying ads and popups where gone, and the best part is that Ghostery remembers your settings for the site so you do not need to shut the ads down on your next visit!

As an IT Support and Computer Repair technician I spend a lot of time working with software. Ghostery is one of the rare applications that really delivers! I give Ghostery a thumbs up.

Subscribing to EasyPrivacy List or Fanboy Annoyances/Social List through ABP is not enough. You need an extension to be able to block everything and control what you block. Ghostie blocks pretty much everything for me (though I feel like it works even better in Firefox) and I can allow certain widgets I use frequently, like disqus and soundcloud, and whitelist certain sites I trust. I would recommend you turn off the alert bubble and choose "block new elements by default". If Ghostery blocks too much stuff for you, just toggle off blocking on widgets. Overall, great, easy-to-use extension.
-------------------------
chrome
this is the best privacy extension on chrome
-------------------------
browser
EDIT: after I got ghostery again(switching browsers), I was a bit annoyed at it showing in the bottom right corner. Then I figured out that when you see the alert bubble you can change the options from there immediately. Just save it and that's it.

Ghostery is awesome, I love it! Simple and easy to use interface/settings that work without confusion unlike Disconnect.(Disconnect confused me)
-------------------------
browser
Best thing that could have happened to my browser. It always makes me smile when I see hundreds of different trackers being blocked on the sites I visit.
-------------------------
firefox
The best, easy to setup, fast, also available for Opera and Firefox. Very long list of sites being blocked.
-------------------------
chrome
Not only does it seem to comprehensively block the most annoying parts of the web, it also provides valuable insight and education into exactly what these trackers do, thereby giving the user actionable intelligence to make the decision whether or not to opt-in to the third-party service. This extension gives control back to the user, plain and simple.
One of the most useful chrome extension. You'll be shocked at how many sites and ad services are tracking you!

Love it!
No negative points to think of.
Does what web browsers should do but don't.

Ghostery is fabulous. It has protected my browser  for years and has NEVER given me any problems.  The interface is clean and easy to use. Thanks for such a practical app!
-------------------------

imo ghostery is much better than donottrackme and it is more concise in firefox than chrome ... wish all the blockers were enabled by default though, you do need to make sure you configure it after install and select update elements automatically in advanced settings

I've been using Ghostery for ages now on Chrome and other browsers and I couldn't live without it. I was very happy to see the developers finally bring over per-site exceptions to the Chrome extension, the one feature I missed the most from its Firefox counterpart.

Keep up the great work!

Brilliant extension for Chrome that cuts out trackers from a wide range of advertising, analytics, beacons and widgets all designed to track your online behaviour.  Regularly updated too.
-------------------------
browser
I've been using Ghostery for many years.  I'm always impressed with its features, completeness and ease of use compared to other ad-blockers.  The only additional configuration needed when setting up is moving the alert box from top-right corner and checking boxes for autoupdate and autoblock for new threats to my privacy.

One of the essential apps for any browser.

This app is amazing! This is exactly what many people need on the internet today! It cleans up garbage that the internet puts on my browser. Continue to do what you do Ghostery!

chrome
Great Addon this should be a standard for Chrome but well google wants to track everything...
-------------------------

Amazing extension. I only use a few extensions (and have tested over 100 throughout my time switching from Firefox to Chrome) and this made the cut. It performs exactly what it states that it will do, no more and no less; which sadly is more than you can say for a lot of extensions throughout many different browsers. The popups did get annoying but eventually I turned them off and sometimes I do mess around with it because it can become very useful. It is easy to add a website to the whitelist so you can keep their trackers running -- and again there are only a few sites out of the many I visit that I allow them to use their tracker(s) - I find this extension very useful and it would receive a 5 star rating and will as soon as or if they do change their popup feature to be more user friendly and not as annoying as it currently is when turned on.

Undoubtedly one of the best extensions I have added to my Chrome library. A must have for any web surfer that wishes to remain as transparent as a ghost.

Thank you so much. 

To anyone who is interested in browsing the web without the web 'browsing' you this extension is for you. If you'd like to be as a ghost and flit in and out of websites without them knowing, install this and watch in wonder as all kinds of trackers are disabled.

Ghostery is one of my favorite Chrome extension. It is constantly blocking all the soliciting and tracking that every website has now. I get satisfaction knowing that I'm blocking some websites from tracking my every move.

It's a nice tool to see what's going on behind your back, because, you are, to the companies that "spy" on you, more or less anonymous. Many people who installed this are hoping to be ads-free on the net, but to them i can recommend this extension IN ADDITION to some great ad-blockers, that are script-blockers. A few good of those is AdBlock, AdBlock Plus (béta), FlashBlock, etc. Pick a good one that has options that you can set webpages as you want on that domain, they even block ALL ADS like on YouTube, or other video sites that got those annoying loud ads. They are the past with them. For your privacy traces, is suggest another very great extension, and that's Click&Clean, it has tons of possibilities, to see everything in Chrome, or your computer. You get 1 button, click on it, and you can manage everything about Chrome, record things, take snapshots, etc, etc. But the best thing is it's main reason for you, and that's CLEANING your surf TRACES, CLEANING ALL or ONLY THE RANDOME COOCKIES, KEEP ALL IMPORTANT YOUR PASSWORDS, FORM DATA, and erase things you want. It also has a great option, where you can click on what, how, when to clean-up. Even when you close Chrome, it then asks remove history, etc.? All with a memory. BUT KEEP GHOSTERY, because who's SPYING ON YOU, those scripts aren't blocked that easy. Because you DON'T SEE THEM, so it doesn't annoy you, but they are there. And GHOSTERY will pinpoint them out for you! Read GHOST. FAQ, and you'll find it all out very easy! Thank you, GHOSTERY, to keep guard for us, and telling us who's peering, spying on us all!!! Succes!!


I have to reload every page suddenly to activate Ghostery. It blocked adds on sites like YT, but now i have to activate Ghost on every page. It was such a good app. Why change it when everything works perfect...

I've been using Ghostery ever since I heard about it a while back, Countless and unimaginable amounts of data and time have been saved because of Ghostery. Successfully allowing the marketers I am wanting to ALLOW vs them not having permission and still placing themselves thru a backdoor cookie, the intrusion and data pulled across so many layers of digital unknowns. (It's disturbing to find out the $ value for just one person on one website;if being specific one of the big players says you are worth exactly $13.00. So, I am happy that this exists. Perhaps a pizzagate preventing script could be  on the horizon expanding Ghostery's capabilitys. Id love to have it prevent me from reading fake news stories. False information = 0 ... This is art in its highest form. Smart technology that is worth the investment to use. Couldn't say enough kudos to the men and women who work and continue to work on this. Thanks folks. Keep up the good work.

This is Most Excellent.

I'm a student and didn't think twice about the university website collecting data. Then I installed the extension and noticed the University home page loading in a fraction of the time. If you don't believe me then go to www.utas.edu.au and try loading it with and without the extension.

something that i'd love to see is an option to narrow down ads. We don't wanna starve off websites, do we? but if you could block ads that are deemed "obnoxious" and keep the non-obnoxious ads, it'd be great! i absolutely love this! works like a assasin rather than a viking!

I was wondering how Ghostery Inc. profited from a free extension so I looked up the company on Wikipedia. It's a double edged sword; on one hand it keeps your activities from being tracked on the other it collects data of what is blocked and sells that data to ad agencies so they can better understand what people prefer to block and not block.
-------------------------
data
Opened my eyes to the sheer amount of data being collected and companies involved in it all!! Great app

Works good in couple with Disconnect. 

Also I don't know how much you can rely on Ghostery - it says it can use your data for their stuff.
-------------------------

Best blocker app I've used. I was concerned about the (rather ironic, IMO) tracking that Ghostery does on its users, but have since learned it's not a big issue (its anonymous aggregate data with the ability to opt-out if you wish). Especially considering how helpful the app is.
Browsing is a much more pleasant experience with this extension installed.

Wish it were available for Android, that would make all Chrome browsing ad and tracker-free!

Now this little extension is a game changer.If you are not one of those people that are copyrighting every little byte that flows out of your computer and no matter what it is that goes out, there is someone out there sub-selling your input hence the tracking but this little extension is bringing us one step closer to inclusion and therefore payment for our efforts by slicing the secret sniffers of at the knees.Yes. I know and the writers of this program sell on what they intercept but this time its not a byte here and a nibble there its constant heavyweight bulk trading of your output and that gets you a name, and names can sue that's after they present their bill.The rest is still unfolding but I suggest for now you get this small but significant app whist the goings good.

I've switched from using Brave to Microsoft Edge Chromium (due to the fact that Edge uses less resources than Brave and is faster than the former) and had added Adblock Plus, but it turned out to be a huge memory hog. A friend recommended Ghostery, which is remarkably lightweight and blazing fast. It blocks all ads and trackers on websites, and I've yet to encounter a broken site. Thanks!
-------------------------
slow
I like the interface and how you can see how many trackers are spotted.
Try for fun pausing ghostery on some sites and you will see how the number of trackers increases because in blocking mode Ghostery sees how many trackers the site itself uses. But whe those trackers are allowed to do their thing they all sneakily invite their friends and you end up with a higher tracker-count. And now we know why some sites are so slow.
I love Ghostery for this. It protects me and also tells me what is going on.
-------------------------

After a long time, I found out a perfect ad blocker with tracker blocking. This is the only ad blocker which also prevents "disable adblocker" pop unders from popular websites. I can finally browse internet without ads and without warnings from websites about using ad blocker. Thenk you team Ghostery for creating such an awesome extension.

I have used several "blocking" software/extensions/apps and this is by far the best - well done guy's, fantastic. I am probably doing something wrong,  but I don't seem to be able to whitelist domains like Channel4 that detects it and will not play catch-up/on demand TV unless I manual pause it, but love the option you can select how long to pause as I don't have to remember to resume Ghostery when done on that domain.

I love ghostery, it does a great job but have found lately that it slows page load by quite a bit. I disabled it which made pages load much quicker but the downside was ALL THOSE FLAMING ADS!!!! I enabled it again to make using my browser more of a pleasure again. I would rather have a small delay than ALL OF THOSE ADS.
More speed would be a bonus guys if possible.

I'm not sure where others are having trouble but this has FRICKING SAVED MY LIFE!!!  Day one of using it and my computer is much faster.  It had gotten so slow no matter what spyware, adware, malware programs I tried that I almost bought a new computer thinking my computer was dying, the hard drive needed changed, something.  It's 60 percent at least faster than it was and I don't feel like breaking my computer.  I'm going to use it for another week and if all is all and I don't have to buy another computer, I will be donating.  Brilliant so far!  :)

Ghostery's latest update adds a cleaner interface with more details and information. Blocking trackers, advertising, analytics, and actually explaining which ones they are. Running this along with ad-blocking you can create a fast, clean, safe internet experience! Great job guys.
-------------------------
long
Long time user and very satisfied with Ghostery. Not sure what problem people are having, but I have the latest upgrade and no problems. Ghostery continues to work as advertised.
-------------------------
long
I've been using Ghostery for a long time and IMHO, this is the best version of the extension yet.

The new bigger panel makes it easier to see at a glance what trackers are present on the current website and it's also easier to check/uncheck blocking options.

The developers have also added the ability to see which blocked tracker is causing a web page not to function correctly.

That is a huge improvement over previous versions because it could take quite a long time to check/uncheck/reload the page to see which trackers, of which there are many on some websites, need to be unblocked for the web page to display correctly.

I wouldn't go anywhere on the web without this extension being loaded and active in my brower.

holy furballs... i can block ads WITHOUT being known i'm blocking ads! for instance, a resource website for gaming, they slow down people with ad blockers, i go there and BAM! no ads, no warning about adblocker, I will finally be able to save some data! great job, ghostery!
something that i'd love to see is an option to narrow down ads. We don't wanna starve off websites, do we? but if you could block ads that are deemed "obnoxious" and keep the non-obnoxious ads, it'd be great! i absolutely love this! works like a assasin rather than a viking!

I have been using this plugin with Google Chrome for over 90 days now, and I am thoroughly impressed. Some of my favorite news websites, unfortunately, seem to have the most advertisements and pop-ups creating a slow and frustrating reading experience.

Ghostery has fixed this issue. At the click of a button the annoying ads and popups where gone, and the best part is that Ghostery remembers your settings for the site so you do not need to shut the ads down on your next visit!

As an IT Support and Computer Repair technician I spend a lot of time working with software. Ghostery is one of the rare applications that really delivers! I give Ghostery a thumbs up.

Very Handy app to weed out all the bloatware cookies that can slow down a site loading whilst your browsing it can also with one click allow the background software and adware cookies that is helpful to remain and not keep asking you if you wanna block them so i like it its surprising how many programs use background software that is no good to you or you just dont need them anymore!

This is very smart from a business perspective as the industry will be changing soon. I am glad to see that some companies like "Ghostery" here are playing fair, and treating their customers with respect and providing them the needed information to chose or invite. I like it! I have no problems in general with the industry of Social Marketing. As long as it's done fair, I know who is watching me, why, and who they mean to give that information to. If it's to make sites work better, or put up ads I may like. That is cool, but when I type in a search request and get taken to the outer mongol turf of the internet instead... It makes being on-line no fun and a chore. It also slows down my work or play, and some times I am researching a topic I want to keep private. I am just glad the industry has decided to self regulate, as change will be coming in a way no body believes possible. So it's better to straighten up and fly right now. Good job, congratulations on the new found sense of morals and true customer care. I think it's a great idea and program!

Not so good.  It also blocks https sites.
-------------------------
block
It works as expected. It is useful to block all insecure sites on public hotspots.
-------------------------
block
This extension does not magically convert insecure connections to secure ones. It simply ensures that HTTPS is chosen over HTTP if both are available. You can also set it to block all plain HTTP connections if desired.
-------------------------
protect
Seems to work quite well and I think it is likely an important tool for protecting oneself on the internet.  I just wish there was an option to get rid of the badge number over the "S" icon in the toolbar area.  I've been able to disable it for every other Chrome extension except this one.
-------------------------
block
Works just fine especially the "block all unencrypted requests" feature. This takes away the hassle of writing "https://" prefix along with the address to know if the site has https connection and protects the user who are connected to a unsecured or public wi-fi. People misunderstands the use of this extension by thinking it "makes a HTTPS version" of the sites they are visiting.

This is okay. It could be better but until it does I truly recommend another much better extension called "Data Compression Proxy(*a.k.a. - DCP)". It works just like this extension the difference btwn the two are the privacy. DCP compresses http traffic then tunnels it through a private connection (HTTPS) while blocking ad trackers that attempt to trace surfers online. After installing it users can surf to a site called http:// 'what is my ip' .com w/ their Chrome browser and notice their browser's ip address change w/ a different and new geo-location displayed to other sites visited. This is how their traffic is tunnelled and compressed through anonymous servers throughout various private  geo-locations and regions. I have given it four stars,  by far.

Good idea, woeful execution; a complete memory hog.

As I type this, with two tabs open, this extension is consuming more memory than the core browser process.

Chome's task manager shows a current tally of 97580K, compared to the Browser's 94932K.

100MB for an extension that does little but redirect to https where possible on the client side? For chromebooks and the like, that's pretty ridiculous.

Fix that, and this extension should be a must-install for most people.

As for the EFF, not only are they an awesome organization, but they respond quickly and efficiently to vulnerabilities when reported.

More HTTPS: good.

This extension is really nice, but it doesn't have any options that you can configure.  It would be nice if you could add and remove sites that it operates on.  I'd like to be able to add other sites that I use frequently that have https versions.  I'd also like to remove some sites that it redirects to https, but the https version doesn't work (like one site gives you a redirect loop error when you try to go to it via https).  Without any way to configure this extension I have to disable it every time I want to go to one of the sites that it breaks.

Bottom line:  The https redirection works great and when they add the ability to configure it I'll give it 5 stars.

Awesome, Thank You very much. People are crying for controls when none are needed, some times to secure something you have to remove the human element. I love that this plug-in simply does what it says. "you know the saying "If it aint broke, don't fix it"

Chome's task manager shows a current tally of 97580K, compared to the Browser's 94932K.

100MB for an extension that does little but redirect to https where possible on the client side? For chromebooks and the like, that's pretty ridiculous.

Fix that, and this extension should be a must-install for most people.

no redirect to https, a pity !!

This extension is really nice, but it doesn't have any options that you can configure.  It would be nice if you could add and remove sites that it operates on.  I'd like to be able to add other sites that I use frequently that have https versions.  I'd also like to remove some sites that it redirects to https, but the https version doesn't work (like one site gives you a redirect loop error when you try to go to it via https).  Without any way to configure this extension I have to disable it every time I want to go to one of the sites that it breaks.

Bottom line:  The https redirection works great and when they add the ability to configure it I'll give it 5 stars.

Back again...lol! Found this terrific hack for Google Chrome to access https only sites. If you want it, send me one million dollars to...ok, ok...here it is: In your address bar, type: chrome://settings/content/...scroll down until you see 'JavaScript'...click off the button(it will show 'Blocked') and 'Add' this: https://*
Or, open Settings (...in the 3 vertical dots...upper right)...click 'Privacy and security'(left side menu)...scroll down to 'Site Settings'...scroll down to 'JavaScript'...
Caveat: I just started using this hack and everything seems fine so far! If I have any problems or find out that this hack is not 100%, then I will report back...

Definitely a cool idea, but in comparison to the Firefox extension, it still needs to improve quite a bit, especially as far as options go.

In particular, an option for turning it off for specific websites (a "whitelist" of sorts) is a must.

I love your Firefox extension, but unfortunately your Chrome version needs some work.

Works just fine especially the "block all unencrypted requests" feature. This takes away the hassle of writing "https://" prefix along with the address to know if the site has https connection and protects the user who are connected to a unsecured or public wi-fi. People misunderstands the use of this extension by thinking it "makes a HTTPS version" of the sites they are visiting.

Great! Tries it's best to give you an HTTPS secure connection to all sites. If it can't, it will search for an HTTPS version of the site (always made by the same person) and redirects you there.

It works just like this extension the difference btwn the two are the privacy. DCP compresses http traffic then tunnels it through a private connection (HTTPS) while blocking ad trackers that attempt to trace surfers online. After installing it users can surf to a site called http:// 'what is my ip' .com w/ their Chrome browser and notice their browser's ip address change w/ a different and new geo-location displayed to other sites visited. This is how their traffic is tunnelled and compressed through anonymous servers throughout various private  geo-locations and regions. I have given it four stars,  by far.

As for the EFF, not only are they an awesome organization, but they respond quickly and efficiently to vulnerabilities when reported.

disconnect

block - 41
block
Useful extension to have alongside uBlock Origin & others in order to reduce the work it takes to identify and block all scripts. I basically use the free version to block the "social media" scripts & plugins various sites use without doing it manually (as in uMatrix or advanced mode of uBO). I'm subtracting points because it's not very effective entirely on the goals they declare in the description, but it's a useful tool to keep alongside several other tools.
-------------------------
block
Um, Doubleclick is owned by google, that's how they serve ads? It's not a notorious tracker it's Google's ad serving platform. Yes you could block it with some of the ad blockers. Google did announce re branding of Doubleclick tho, dunno what their plans with it are.

My advice is: 
1. Use Disconnect and some AdBlocker
2. Update your HOSTS file (just google how to do it).
You can download maintaned list of variuos ad platforms/redirect ad/affiliate networks/ malicious sites to put into your HOSTS file (thus blocking it — basically by putting www.somesite.com 0.0.0.0 (or 127.0.0.1 aka the loopback ip) you tell your system to ignore the DNS server and use HOSTS file and thus redirect said unwanted site back to non-routable meta-address (0.0.0.0) or loopback (locahost) so it doesn't resolve.
That's super effective way of blocking stuff.

Here's some links for maintaned HOSTS files:
https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/ aka "How to make the Internet not suck (as much)" and
http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm  by Winhelp

Alternatively you could use those two and autoupdate the hosts file with a script such as:
https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
Steven Black's script uses both data from someonewhocares and MVPS and few others (malwaredomainlist etc). 

All sites I mentioned are free, they are doing great work and they update lists of malicious sites regularly.

Hope this helps. 

DIsclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with Disconnect nor any other extension or the sites I linked.

One of, if not, the best of privacy extensions to have in the modern age of data mining, carving and harvesting. I've used this for a long time and it's chockload of options from full black/whitelisting of sites/pages and fully customisable plugin loading if a page/site requires some plugins to run for full functionality. Protects privacy, improves loading times, conserves bandwidth amongst other things. Obviously, it may work better for some more than others but give it a shot and dig deep into the options for best results.

The extension has a least impact on the web-browser's performance & compliments the 'snappy' characteristic of Google Chrome. Would have liked even more had they discontinued their recurring donation window.Cleaning the web-browser's entire history makes it re-appear again & again!

Really good application. Doesn't track me while blocking trackers, encrypting web data, and speeding up page load time. You don't have to donate when you install it despite what it looks like disconnect.me would appreciate it if you would share the application instead or subscribe to them on a social media website. I plan to donate for the extension and use the search engine for Disconnect as soon as possible.

Simple, elegant way to prevent unwanted third party and tracking cookies. If you are like me and would just like to control what you can (and not someone who thinks the government is tracking your grocery purchases through the cardboard sim card in your prepaid phone) this is a great idea. I noticed people mentioning that certain sites dont work after installing- you just need to add it to the permissible list and change your settings to be a little less restrictive and your services will work again. I went through this with my gmail acct. Anyway, this is a must have for peace of mind.

Everything Works perfectly. blocks trackers for Fb and google all day long. (thats all i mostly use i dont use yahoo or twitter)

sHH..THIS is perfect! who needs cyber groups and all that other nosey a** stuff? The more it blocks the better...huh, i just finally  got rid of a psyc=ho stalker girl that just wouldnt leave me alone! we need more defensive apps like this! :)

I love the fact that this extension blocks all of these annoying behaviors.  It's excellent in that respect.  The only downside is that I could not be logged into both gmail and calendar simultaneously in different tabs with the "depersonalize searches" box checked.  Fix that and it's perfect, imo.

Adnan, you can disable the purple popup in Ghostery's settings.

Works well everywhere EXCEPT Facebook. Facebook seems to have found a hook or other method to disable Disconnect which is annoying when they are one of the worst offenders for tracking and analytics.

I've been using this for quite a while. I love it for Facebook. There's the odd site that plays up even if I select the whitelist option but most are ok.

For those giving low scoring reviews for not allowing whitelisting, the option's there. It's about 2/3 of the way down on the left side of the popup if you click the Disconnect logo under your minimise button.

I used the old "Twitter Disconnect" and "Facebook Disconnect" and liked them so much more than this new all-in-one.

It's in your way, and doesn't have even the slightest global config-options available. All options seem to be site-specific.

The so-called friendly reminders are also very annoying. And waaaaay to frequent. 

I'll uninstall and look for a decent replacement.

One of, if not, the best of privacy extensions to have in the modern age of data mining, carving and harvesting. I've used this for a long time and it's chockload of options from full black/whitelisting of sites/pages and fully customisable plugin loading if a page/site requires some plugins to run for full functionality. Protects privacy, improves loading times, conserves bandwidth amongst other things. Obviously, it may work better for some more than others but give it a shot and dig deep into the options for best results.

Um, Doubleclick is owned by google, that's how they serve ads? It's not a notorious tracker it's Google's ad serving platform. Yes you could block it with some of the ad blockers. Google did announce re branding of Doubleclick tho, dunno what their plans with it are.

My advice is: 
1. Use Disconnect and some AdBlocker
2. Update your HOSTS file (just google how to do it).
You can download maintaned list of variuos ad platforms/redirect ad/affiliate networks/ malicious sites to put into your HOSTS file (thus blocking it — basically by putting www.somesite.com 0.0.0.0 (or 127.0.0.1 aka the loopback ip) you tell your system to ignore the DNS server and use HOSTS file and thus redirect said unwanted site back to non-routable meta-address (0.0.0.0) or loopback (locahost) so it doesn't resolve.
That's super effective way of blocking stuff.

Here's some links for maintaned HOSTS files:
https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/ aka "How to make the Internet not suck (as much)" and
http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm  by Winhelp

Alternatively you could use those two and autoupdate the hosts file with a script such as:
https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
Steven Black's script uses both data from someonewhocares and MVPS and few others (malwaredomainlist etc). 

All sites I mentioned are free, they are doing great work and they update lists of malicious sites regularly.

Hope this helps.

This app helped me proved att and apple I was not just going crazy and that my phone was hacked. they talked to me like an idot because I was not in IT but they under estimated me being able to learn and catch my hacker. i will always used  use this and all my family does now, btw att the read my notes I was an anoying business guy he got rude I replied dude if anyone is to be rude is me I make 2-3 times what you do but be humble and he said well maybe you should take some it classes not knowing at that point i was already in full control off his device. I gave him a scare and got legal on the phone but and got him fired because he didnt want to tell me who he was so I just snaped a screen shootand went from there. this app thous is amazing for beginers and vets and better than lockdown privacy or nextdns.io/

Useful extension to have alongside uBlock Origin & others in order to reduce the work it takes to identify and block all scripts. I basically use the free version to block the "social media" scripts & plugins various sites use without doing it manually (as in uMatrix or advanced mode of uBO).

Pay before you even try it out? Forget it! ....the nagware starts the instant you install it and they have the nerve to suggest you pay as much as $1000 dollars and only as low as $10 for what you get nagged instantly for, even though you have no idea what it's all about! It's a "Come On" in the same sense Cal Worthington always showed off his dog Spot... who was never a dog in the first place!!!

I think this is a great app.  But I think the main page needs a bit of how to info.

The extension has a least impact on the web-browser's performance & compliments the 'snappy' characteristic of Google Chrome. Would have liked even more had they discontinued their recurring donation window.Cleaning the web-browser's entire history makes it re-appear again & again! Lets see if go ahead to block Auto-playing Videos too in the time to come!?..though I would not reckon the feature at the cost of its slick performance! Thank you.

excellent product that cuts down on data usage, speeds up your browing and keeps the ad men at bay!

Works well.  Speeds up browsing.

One feature I'd request would be the ability to right-click on a page to selectively allow trackers.

This is necessary for many "log in with Facebook"-style dialogs.  Currently, I have to just disable Disconnect.me entirely to use such dialogs.

Really good application. Doesn't track me while blocking trackers, encrypting web data, and speeding up page load time. You don't have to donate when you install it despite what it looks like disconnect.me would appreciate it if you would share the application instead or subscribe to them on a social media website. I plan to donate for the extension and use the search engine for Disconnect as soon as possible.

Great extension! Very well done!

It works as advertised but slows everything down. It's like having a telephone connection.  Just not worth it for me.

So far it's worked great and I've noticed a definite increase in browsing speed

slow
I have tried all the ad blockers and they all slow Chrome down and you can't scroll some pages until they fully load. I found a thread where someone was complaining about ad blockers slowing Chrome down and saw someone suggest Disconnect. Wow!!! One page I go to daily takes 8secs to load with no ad blocker, 9.5 with all of the other ad blockers and 0.7secs with Disconnect! I think it's time to make a donation.

Wow, it actually works. And it works good. It will keep tap of tracking cookies and block them if it finds the same cookie on 3 sites you visit. You still need uBlock Origin to block ads, and you still need audio, canvas and font fingerprinting extensions installed if you hope to stay a little private on the web. A nice vpn like Mullvad is probably not too shabby either.

Amazing extension, a perfect addition to an ad blocker. A lot of websites these days will block access to their website if they detect an adblocker. With Privacy Badger you'll fly under the radar:-) In general I'm not against ads and understand that websites that provide valuable info need to make money but the tracking of a user across the web has gotten out of control. I'm glad that EFF came up with a solution to stop the madness. Thank you.

I run this along with uBlock Origin and Social Fixer.  Social Fixer is an extension that only works with Facebook and it blocks all sponsored ads and then whatever else you'd like to block.

WOuld be great if privacy badger could be set to block or block cookies on all 3rd party domains by default.

Great plugin. Had some initial teething problems as I figured out what was OK to block and what wasn't. But once that was done it was smooth going.
-------------------------
block
It has the right idea, but it blocks too much, and doesn't let you customize it.  I also found that if you want to log into a Google service, it won't let you stay logged in, I don't know if this is by design, but it should let you toggle certain aspects on and off if needed.  Keep up the good work!

Great app to block unwanted tracking ads. Works seamlessly. Only issue is it blocks Chrome Remote Desktop. I had to deactivate badger so Remote Desktop could work. Hopefully that will change with future updates.

You may not realise that it's a 5 star extension, until you try other tracker-blocker extensions.

Once you see how much they demand from the user, how slowly they adapt to new trackers and how little they allow you to see which trackers are permitted or not, you will cherish privacy badger dearly in comparison. It helps you tweak it with ease and after a few manual tweaks, it begins automaticlaly adapting to your style of hating tracking vs not minding tracking.

I like that this is a one-exploit fix instead of a plugin claiming to spoof all forms of user fingerprinting, since new methods of that come up all the time. It's better to be certain that you have a particular weakness patched up because you have an extension that corresponds to it exactly, than to go without preventing a leak because you assumed it was included in some catchall extension but it wasn't.

PS: Anyone who cannot figure out that they can click on the extension's icon and pick "Show|Hide desktop notifications" simply doesn't DESERVE to use this extension. Heh.  Really, the developer should just turn this option off by default, since it's obviously the only thing causing unhappy feedback.

Awesome, does exactly what I need it to do!  Although, I know how to detect this with Javascript, it just takes a little bit of thinking ;-).

perfect, does what i need it to do, it will randomize your fingerprint across all sites trying to read it.

Google Admin console - Chrome for Business does not pass along the uploaded configuration file (exported out of the extension) for our Managed Sessions.  The extension loads, but with default values each time.  We have 100s of Chrome workstations that this extension -- with our configuration -- can resolve!  Can this be done??

As a private user in our domain, it works as advertised and can help solve real world issues with Patient and EHR portals that still "rely" on IE11 (their poor browser detection off User-Agent inspection).

Works great to get the real Outlook Web App working on my Chromebook. FU Microsoft. You're blocking Chromebooks from doing real work just to protect your ever-diminishing market share.

Does what is advertised.

However, I normally only use this extension to force sites into mobile when my current Chrome window is using half of the screen. It would be nice to have the extension detect the size of the window and automatically enable itself if it is, for example, 1024x768 or smaller.

• Add a custom text field for custom UA.

Nice extension, but it doesn't work.
At least on Linux, Chrome Version 40.0.2214.111 (64-bit)

It allows to spoof the agent string only for certain domains. Which is perfect for me because it allows me to access my office Outlook Web App Premium on Linux by changing the OS in the agent string.

The user interface is a bit clumsy and needs more love, hence only 4 stars.

I love developers making the handy and cool things like this extension, now I have Facebook and others knocking off "warnings that Chrome you're using is outdated, upgrade here" messages.
Haha, they don't know the difference, not counting they think I'm using Mac when it's really Linux!
Fun stuff to see, it's great.
I have an old Chrome 48.0.2 and can't upgrade since they no longer offer 32 bit for Linux but this overrides the issue.
I haven't tried the autoselect feature so I cannot rate that, I'm using the manually put in one and it's great.

One thing that is imperfect about the extension is getting any of my webfonts to display properly in Exp 7 - 9, but then again, I've yet to see any browser agent tester successfully do so.

Other than that, I love this extension and use it daily! Hope to donate soon, thank you for creating and sharing!

Very useful in web development.

Would be great if it was possible to specify a centralized (hosted) XML file to keep everyone with the same user-agent lists in a corporate environment and have it to auto-update periodically.

An "Edit" button on a user-agent entry would also be appreciated. Right now, you have to delete and recreate an entry to update some details, which is counter-productive.

firefox
Feature-rich, allows you to add new user agent identifier strings, and to set up per-site settings (e.g. always pretend to be Firefox on Yahoo! Mail, and IE on Hotmail).

I've tried them all and User-Agent Switcher for Chrome is the best! The option "Permanent Spoof list" is just wonderful. Thanks to the author!

Perfect. Exactly what I needed to get MS OUtlook web app at work to give chrome for linux the "full" web app and not the "light" one.

Incredibly useful for testing browsers in web development. It would be great if we could set per-tab UA

I noticed it used about 60 megs of private memory in Chrome 

chrome://memory-redirect/

That's way too much for an extension like this.

used on firefox to save bandwidth now trying on chrome.Hope for best

Works great spoofing for firefox on ubuntu chrome to work w/OWA Exchange 2010
-------------------------
firefox
So far so good. I can now use Outlook without being in Firefox or IE!
-------------------------
chrome
Does what is advertised.

However, I normally only use this extension to force sites into mobile when my current Chrome window is using half of the screen. It would be nice to have the extension detect the size of the window and automatically enable itself if it is, for example, 1024x768 or smaller.
-------------------------
chrome
Such a great add-on! However I'd really appreciate two more features:
1) ability to edit existing user-agent strings
2) is it possible to share custom user-strings via Google sync in Chrome? Once I install Chrome to another PC, the add-on get installed, which is great, but without my custom agents I created on different installation.

Thanks for such useful tool! 
best,

Since T-Mob,MetroPOS, and others have gotten wise to "unauthorized" tethering, which they do via desktop browser blocking, this is a perfect way around their BS! 

Set to Android or ipad and tether away!

Excellent extension. Unfortunately settings are shared between all chrome tabs, including Incognito. It would be nice to have different user agents for different tabs.

Finnaly the Extension works and we have a Extension for User Agent Switching in Chrome. Great work!

Now I need to find a list of User Agents for different Android devices.

Nice One! no need to PC Sharing for checking webpage to other browser such as IE6

great work, now i am using it to browser gmail with my win8 tablet. If it can use pull down option to quickly add present page to permanent spoof list, that will be great. For example, in proxy switch extension, there is a new rule button to add url, that is very cool.
-------------------------

Works great since the 1.0.12 build! Allows me to use Oracle Financials at work through Chrome (need to set user agent to Mac Safari 4).

Great extension. I wanted to be able to use Chromium instead of (boo, hiss, etc) Firefox to sell on eBay - and this does it perfectly. Better yet it lets me set it up to "always-be-firefox" whenever I'm on an eBay site.

This is magnificent - worked first time.  I was so impressed that this thing should work so easily that although I noted that the Outlook Light checkbox was no longer disabled I completely forgot to uncheck it.  Soon sorted and now Outlook Web App full version is available.
-------------------------
fast
Right to the point.  Allows you to add custom user agents as well.  It's fast to switch between user agents, why would you use anything else?

Works like a charm. Using outlook web app on chromium (Xubuntu) would force me into light mode. With this extension, I have the premium mode available. So it does the trick. Thx!

-------------------------

Very helpful , can do many things (used it for ad blocking , user agent spoofing ..)
-------------------------
block
If you want to surf securely and get rid of annoying or +18 ads, this extension is the solution. Block anything you want without Adblock Detectors. You don't block the ad, you block the domain where the ad comes from, that's why Adblock Detectors can't detect what are you doing. Such an amazing program that saved my life. Thanks to creators.
-------------------------
block
It works nice! 
I am using this is very much like NoScript  on firefox. 
However, in the course of webdev over the years there is an increasing amount of use cases where important page elements simply disappear on a website when some site is not enabled. 

I believe this style of webpages are increasing, so what we really need is a shared database with a finer classifications of sites. 
I can imagine a kind of site-voting engine for script block users, so its easy to share the classification of a site and see classification from others.

In the end its about a quick decision to include frontend code from certrain sites, sometimes its needed, sometimes not, sometimes its essential! 

I encountered some bad examples where a checkout flow was missing very important parts.
So if sites which are known to create important content can be tagged, this information can be fed back to the script blocking extentions to support the user in the decision of enabling additional sources.

I see a few different approaches to move forward:
-an integrated evaluation scheme to simplify classification of javascript servers
- maybe even a computation intensive black box approach where the code is executed in a box and the difference to the DOM is evaluated to judge the impact

I think the users of this plugin are a really good user group to discuss  this! :)
-------------------------
block
I've been using it for a long time now to block ads and other unwanted content. It's not perfect, but it's great. There are moments where it seems to have like a hundred things to block or unblock, but it's tolerable.

Right now, however, I am experiencing a popup on my homepage "chrome://apps/" where it detects that I have things synched to Google and asks for permission to do so every time I launch Chrome even though I have it set not to provide that popup.
-------------------------
block
This is the first extension where I can control which specific inside sites (not what you enter but what the site is trying to open) I need to block. Sometimes I need to allow some sites like for a captcha and this is the first extension that allow me to do that
-------------------------
protect
A great add-on for the security conscious. It can be a heavy lift to get it set up for viewing websites that you routinely go to, but it puts you in direct control of what enters your platform, protecting you from dodgy websites and drive-by attacks.
-------------------------
block
the best, successfully blocked mining scripts. Except that, it is necessary to keep marking as Trust the sites ...
-------------------------
block
It is amazing, it works exactly as expected and above all, it can replace dozens of other extensions like blocking canvas, webrtc, youtube ads, etc. Obviously, some fine tuning by the user is constantly required, since it blocks all scripts. It is not install and forget as a casual adblocker, but the payoff is well worth it: a fast, safe and tracking free browsing. Thank you.
-------------------------
block
Blocking bullshit scripts!  Literally blocks everything though.  NP for someone w half a brain though.  Good kush
-------------------------
block
Thanks you so much, work perfect but need more improve. My suggestion, add new function that can view what script it block in text file only.
-------------------------
prevent
Would definitely recommend. So much safer browsing sites, without unwanted tracking, scripts, or ads. 

Great addition to along side fire wall protection for prevention of web malware and tracking cookies and annoying page scripts. 

And author has put a lot of work into updating and adding more protection, like keyboard or device tracking, and features to hide your details.
-------------------------
block
This is an excellent and safe way to browse the internet. It allows me to make intelligent choices about who and what has access to my browser and its contents. It even blocks things naturally on my favorite sites and tells me what it is blocking! I can progress through levels of allowance and only allow main site functionality or I can easily trust for just a session or entirely trust forever! This has been an excellent tool and I applaud the author for his hard work.
-------------------------

Amazing 
Also block Anti-AD block scripts.
-------------------------
block
Am suffered from unknown script injection from the domain "cdn.adonads.com" after using this extension I can able to block js from this site. It simply awesome.
-------------------------
block
If you know what you're doing, it's a great little tool!  I was have some weird lag problems with Facebook and this showed me that Facebook was running a number of webbugs and allowed me to specifically block those scripts.  I've never seen Facebook run so fast!  Fixed some weird lag problems I was having with some other sites as well (more webbugs!).

Like I said, if you've got some smarts around a computer, you're gonna' love this one.
-------------------------
block
I can understand why people might rate this extension down, considering how much time a user must devote to manually filtering scripts, but I have to give it five stars, because I like the control I have in blocking scripts for various reasons. personally, it is the next best thing since NoScript that I still use with Firefox.
-------------------------
block
I wouldn't browse the internet with out this. I love how antisocial just flat out blocks buzzfeed. Bravo.

Handful of minor issues (blocking safe sites) that are easily worked around (just turn off the add-on for a few minutes). Best way to harden Chrome against malware.

I'm using this with Google's Chrome Dev Channel build and it works quite well.

I've been a Firefox user for years and had been going back to Firefox because of the NoScript Add-On. If you're familiar with NoScript on Firefox you'll quickly find this useful and about as intuitive as NoScript.

One thing I really like about Firefox's latest Nightly build is that, by default when connecting to a site via https, Firefox will block all insecure elements.

AdBlock Plus is available for Chrome and now I have a NoScript equivalent. For the first time in many Tech years I've set a different browser to be my default.
-------------------------
protect
Must have protection. It's incredible the amount of extra websites and scripts affecting our navigation, some of them useful and needed, others just junk slowing the navigation or sniffing. This extension lets you see what's going on, who's there and who is allowed to stay.
-------------------------
block
A great software. I used to use NoScript on Firefox to avoid unwanted content like bg music and many. ScriptNo does the same and works like a charm. While I have a little suggestion, would you consider setting a whitelist for files? I need to look up some literature on web thus view many .pdf using Chrome. ScriptNo on default blocked them all for me, could you allow a setting such that I can unblock all .pdf link by default? Thanks for your kind attention.
-------------------------
block
Is there any way to approve webbugs on certain cites?  I like the idea of blocking hidden scripts, but some sites might need those WEBBUG's in order to work (such as amazon's universal wishlist).

Otherwise a great app.
-------------------------
block
Wonderful extension.  Hwever I wish there was a way to allow all TLD's (Top Level Domains) but block all else, just like in NoScript for firefox.
-------------------------
block
Great extension -- a long-needed addition to Chrome, security-conscious power users finally have a real equivalent to NoScript for FF.  The only downside is that the NoScript interface is still more intuitive -- ScriptNo doesn't always start by showing you the full list of blocked elements, some seem to show up/disappear sporadically or only after the primary domain is whitelisted.  I'm sure this will get better with time and may be due to API limitations -- keep up the great work!

fingerprint
It actually works. I tried it with Blank canvas reading it seems to generate random numbers every time. amiunique.org reports every time that I am unique, but it's the only browser fingerprint out of whatever-number-it-is that they collected. So every request that you send is unique but not repeatable.
Overall, very good job, Developer! I used NoScript before, but with Chrome it often doesn't work properly.

Just recently (past week/since new updates) youtube has been taking like 10-15 seconds to load pages. I'm pretty sure that's the only site i've noticed this on so far. I also backed up my settings and re-installed the extension to no luck :/

Not sure what else to do, or if some options are conflicting with each other. I looked at some of the reviews and I guess you're going to be fixing the performance and other issues people have brought up in next patch.

been using your extension for years, glad to see you active again. I also really like your website! Lots of useful information and cool projects :D
-------------------------
fix
I appreciate the feedback. A "Show Update Notification" option was recently added, giving you control over notifications (the other existing option controls if the update changelog page appears).

error
Amazing extension.
Requires User Knowledge to use effectively and quickly.

It is not for everyone but works. If you have the patience to see what it takes to learn about scripts, cookies etc, it will be part trial and error, part reading about sites and looking at the links.

Would only recommend to those wanting to get frustrated before finding enjoyment in it's effect.
-------------------------
load
Really good control of all the scripts that would run on the computer.  Really makes my browsing experience more secure and configured right you can make it so that all the ads do not even load, though for a cost of taking time to configure it correctly.  Over all if you are a power user and want some more control this extension is for you.
-------------------------
load
Very Nice! If your knowledge of scripts is low you'll most likely uninstall out of frustration.  With that in the clear i'm glad to have control of which scripts and when if any a page can load, and this extension does a great job for Chrome in my humble opinion.  Keep up the good work and thanks!
-------------------------
error
I really like this add-on.  I can understand some of the complaints of this being "too complicated", this add-on takes a little time to get running smoothly.  Especially on more complicated sites (i.e. Youtube, Facebook, some news sites) that run lots of scripts, it can take some time to figure out what scripts you want running that are actually important to the function of the website.  This is just a matter of setting certain ones as "Temp" and seeing what effect it has.  The trial and error can be frustrating, but it's worth it.  Once you get it going on your most visited websites, the experience is flawless!

Yep, you have to keep marking trust the sites, but after a while you get most of the sites you go to regularly happily whitelisted.

One of the best browser extensions, period.  If you're serious about taking control of your browsing security, this is a must have.  Also, works flawlessly on SRWare Iron (based on Chromium, the open source version of Chrom) for Mac as of version 16.  Great work, Andrew!

-------------------------
config
better and much more powerful than adblock and adblock plus , but have to config by yourself , not suitable without tech background, the BTC donation may not work, the Scripts Safe have detail config than Commercial property software   Kaspersky / Norton / Checkpoint /Websense / SEcurity appliance
-------------------------
sync
Syncs settings to your Google account, which is fantastic for system re-installs. The extension works really well.

It may be a bit finicky, but if you like control over scripts running on websites then this is the way to go. Even if you don't have it enabled 24/7 it's still a valuable tool to have.
-------------------------
sync
Please add sync functionality for whitelist/blacklist. Really is a pain for multiple computers. Approving same websites all the time.

I'm using this with Google's Chrome Dev Channel build and it works quite well.

I've been a Firefox user for years and had been going back to Firefox because of the NoScript Add-On. If you're familiar with NoScript on Firefox you'll quickly find this useful and about as intuitive as NoScript.

One thing I really like about Firefox's latest Nightly build is that, by default when connecting to a site via https, Firefox will block all insecure elements.

AdBlock Plus is available for Chrome and now I have a NoScript equivalent. For the first time in many Tech years I've set a different browser to be my default.
-------------------------

Rated 3 stars because you must release base-level domain every single site.  Would be great if there was a feature to allow you to release the domain you go to by default.

A great software. I used to use NoScript on Firefox to avoid unwanted content like bg music and many. ScriptNo does the same and works like a charm. While I have a little suggestion, would you consider setting a whitelist for files? I need to look up some literature on web thus view many .pdf using Chrome. ScriptNo on default blocked them all for me, could you allow a setting such that I can unblock all .pdf link by default? Thanks for your kind attention.

It works nice! 
I am using this is very much like NoScript  on firefox. 
However, in the course of webdev over the years there is an increasing amount of use cases where important page elements simply disappear on a website when some site is not enabled. 

I believe this style of webpages are increasing, so what we really need is a shared database with a finer classifications of sites. 
I can imagine a kind of site-voting engine for script block users, so its easy to share the classification of a site and see classification from others.

In the end its about a quick decision to include frontend code from certrain sites, sometimes its needed, sometimes not, sometimes its essential! 

I encountered some bad examples where a checkout flow was missing very important parts.
So if sites which are known to create important content can be tagged, this information can be fed back to the script blocking extentions to support the user in the decision of enabling additional sources.

I see a few different approaches to move forward:
-an integrated evaluation scheme to simplify classification of javascript servers
- maybe even a computation intensive black box approach where the code is executed in a box and the difference to the DOM is evaluated to judge the impact

I think the users of this plugin are a really good user group to discuss  this! :)
-------------------------
chrome
I've been using it for a long time now to block ads and other unwanted content. It's not perfect, but it's great. There are moments where it seems to have like a hundred things to block or unblock, but it's tolerable.

Right now, however, I am experiencing a popup on my homepage "chrome://apps/" where it detects that I have things synched to Google and asks for permission to do so every time I launch Chrome even though I have it set not to provide that popup.
-------------------------
firefox
Seems like a good alternative to NoScript for Firefox. I'm glad this exists. Just what I was looking for.
-------------------------
browser
It actually works. I tried it with Blank canvas reading it seems to generate random numbers every time. amiunique.org reports every time that I am unique, but it's the only browser fingerprint out of whatever-number-it-is that they collected. So every request that you send is unique but not repeatable.
Overall, very good job, Developer! I used NoScript before, but with Chrome it often doesn't work properly.

This Chrome extension is a great replacement for NoScript 10 with Firefox 57 Quantum released in the last day with issues https://hackademix.net/2017/11/14/double-noscript/ .  Like the old NoScript 5 for Firefox, ScriptSafe for Chrome found very intuitive setting up to individually allow or not multiple scripts per website and a temporary allow option, all with simple clicking.  The list of scripts allowed or not can also conveniently be exported or later imported for backup purposes.
-------------------------
browser
Excellent. This one extension replaces a number of other extensions and returns my browsers to a nice simple Web 1.0 view without all the scripted junk.
-------------------------
browser
My solution to your problem is to create another user on Chrome without ScriptSafe on  (or use another browser, say Vivaldi or Firefox) specifically for those kinds of websites that force all sorts of scripts on us.  

Hope that helps.

Semoga saja app ini bisa mirip seperti noscript di moziila firefox ^_^

Chromes recover feature fncks up all the time for me and I've never had this extension installed. Just to say that perhaps it was not the extension, Chrome has it's moments too... ;]
-------------------------
browser
This is an excellent and safe way to browse the internet. It allows me to make intelligent choices about who and what has access to my browser and its contents. It even blocks things naturally on my favorite sites and tells me what it is blocking! I can progress through levels of allowance and only allow main site functionality or I can easily trust for just a session or entirely trust forever! This has been an excellent tool and I applaud the author for his hard work.
-------------------------
chrome
I hope it goes without saying that having a Script Blocker is a must. This one is my favorite one for Chromium / Google Chrome. Compared to NoScript on Firefox, ScriptSafe is a little bit more complicated, but once you've set it up for your pages it doesn't bother you anymore.
-------------------------
firefox
so far this has been as reliable as No Script on Firefox, but I use along with other extensions.
-------------------------
browser
A Brilliant Extension! This  is just what I was looking for days after my chrome browser was terribly affected by browser hijackers. It's easy and flexible to use and does perform incredibly superior to other alternatives and other AdBlockers.

I could notice my webpages being loaded 10x times faster after using this extension!!

Great work.. Love it!!

Script Defender for real browser control and http switchboard for  all background control in chrome!

My son is a techie guru and recommended me to run these so i di i feel so safe!

As close as one can get to NoScript for FireFox while using Chrome.

Great Extension, which is  similar to noscript on firefox.  Thanks for building this!
-------------------------
firefox
I can understand why people might rate this extension down, considering how much time a user must devote to manually filtering scripts, but I have to give it five stars, because I like the control I have in blocking scripts for various reasons. personally, it is the next best thing since NoScript that I still use with Firefox.
-------------------------
chrome
Very Nice! If your knowledge of scripts is low you'll most likely uninstall out of frustration.  With that in the clear i'm glad to have control of which scripts and when if any a page can load, and this extension does a great job for Chrome in my humble opinion.  Keep up the good work and thanks!
-------------------------
browser
Excellent. It would be great, if the control of the extension can be made per tab, rather than the browser, would not need to disable the extension while browsing safe sites (as it does not adequately save settings across computers)
-------------------------
browser
Pretty good. I think that the app is nice. It gives me peace of mind on the web, and I can also spoof my browser ID on websites.
-------------------------
chrome
Handful of minor issues (blocking safe sites) that are easily worked around (just turn off the add-on for a few minutes). Best way to harden Chrome against malware.
-------------------------
chrome
Awesome add-on, and superior to noscript.  The people complaining that its 'too complicated' to allow trusted sites are simply inexperienced computer users.  If you have even a rudimentary understanding of HTML and website file structures ScriptSafe is the add-on you want.  You can specifically enable ONLY the scripts you want to run on the site.  As I said if you know what you are doing this is superior to noscript because you can make sure that only the script for the site and the comments section works, for example.  Absolutely no chance of malicious scripts running with this on your Chrome.

Great app, very very useful, although if you're not used to manually approving new sites it can feel like a lot of work.

One feature request: add a way to access permission controls from the context menu, so you  can set them on apps that lack a browser bar.

Update 5/24/13
Another feature request: shortcut keys! Using the mouse is tedious.

Really useful apps to control what script especially third parties can be allowed for safety and non tracking.Can set what you want in the options of the extension.Instead of disabling javascript in chrome settings..we can just control it with Scriptsafe.

If you are looking for the "NoScript" extension for Chrome, you've found it with ScriptNo.  This is a great extension to increase your security against all sorts of nefarious Java issues. Plus it can help with some privacy issues as well.

-------------------------
chrome
Great extension -- a long-needed addition to Chrome, security-conscious power users finally have a real equivalent to NoScript for FF.  The only downside is that the NoScript interface is still more intuitive -- ScriptNo doesn't always start by showing you the full list of blocked elements, some seem to show up/disappear sporadically or only after the primary domain is whitelisted.  I'm sure this will get better with time and may be due to API limitations -- keep up the great work!

This is truely the best and the only closest thing next to Firefox's NoScript for Chrome. Tried NotScript, but developer are too lazy to polish the UI, configuration is too unfriendly. This one has best, user-friendly UI.

Beautiful UI. Much better than Firefox's noscript. And I'm a die-hard fan of noscript.
-------------------------
chrome
FINALLY!

I had tried some of the other NoScript chrome clones and was seriously disappointed.  Although I'm sure I will find some quirks and whatnot in the future, it does what its supposed to do, and does so very easily.

In my opinion, the visual layout of this extension is superior to the extremely boring yet perfectly plain one of its Firefox master.

Currently its obvious that ScriptNo hasn't achieved the level of excellence that its big daddy NoScript has. Meh, oh well, it does its dang job, looks good, and saves you from your own stupidity on the web. Perfection (so far).

It is amazing, it works exactly as expected and above all, it can replace dozens of other extensions like blocking canvas, webrtc, youtube ads, etc. Obviously, some fine tuning by the user is constantly required, since it blocks all scripts.

I know that most times, just working with the toggle on/off from the button is fine, but I have noticed on very rare occasions, a site might not get removed from the list, so a more visible listing would be nice. As I said, it's not a game-changer or a deal breaker, just an "I wish." Thanks for all your hard work.

Once installed, I notice that most websites load significantly quicker with no missing content, loading problems, or other trouble. Additionally, it is wonderful to know that I am cutting down on each website's ability to track me.

Unlike some content blockers I've used in the past, Decentraleyes does not require configuration before it can be used. There's no downloading or subscribing to lists. While the extension does let me whitelist specific websites, I have not found a website which needs to be whitelisted.

Finally, the developer of Decentraleyes, Thomas, is a great person. Not only has he provided a wealth of information about the extension within the Overview tab on the Chrome Web Store, he actively monitors issue reports and provides excellent support.

Every single thing about this extension is well built. I strongly recommend using Decentraleyes.

The "load pages more quickly" feature goes a quite a bit further than looking up DNS records. It pre-renders sites, and opens up TCP and SSL connections.

I am giving Decentraleyes 2.0 a five-star review sheerly for the inclusion of the "HTTPS Everywhere Configuration Guide," a clever, self-explanatory landing page that helps the user avoid common conflicts with the HTTPS extension. There are so many useful "security hygiene" browser extensions that I have previously disabled (including HTTPS!), simply because they don't play well together. I'm hoping that Decentraleyes's Config Guide becomes a standard practice!! Very innovative and considerate.
-------------------------
browser
should be part of every browser

Browser builders should include Decentraleyes by default! What a great idea and the technical support is great too. Thank you!

Always used out of the box in Firefox with no problem whatsoever. Waiting to have it on Chrome for long time. Thank you Thomas.

I used it on Firefox and always wished it would get ported over to Chrome. 

Brilliant extension!
-------------------------

It's available now on Chrome Extensions store, so it's compatible with Opera, Brave, and other browsers built with Chromium.

Holy web browsers, Batman!!! This thing just sped up my Google Chrome by 500%!!!!!

TEN stars!!! Everyone get it NOW!!!!!

Makes for faster browsing and better privacy - great work.

This should be on everyones Chrome.

The Decentraleyes extension is incredible.

Once installed, I notice that most websites load significantly quicker with no missing content, loading problems, or other trouble. Additionally, it is wonderful to know that I am cutting down on each website's ability to track me.

Unlike some content blockers I've used in the past, Decentraleyes does not require configuration before it can be used. There's no downloading or subscribing to lists. While the extension does let me whitelist specific websites, I have not found a website which needs to be whitelisted.

Finally, the developer of Decentraleyes, Thomas, is a great person. Not only has he provided a wealth of information about the extension within the Overview tab on the Chrome Web Store, he actively monitors issue reports and provides excellent support.

Every single thing about this extension is well built. I strongly recommend using Decentraleyes.
-------------------------
chrome
While I've seen other extensions around that work on a similar premise, I like this one because:

* I've not found any sites breaking when using Decentraleyes

* The developer has written really good instructions on getting it 
to play nice with uBlock and HTTPS Everywhere, which are essential extensions for me. It's nice being able to use an extension of this sort without having Chrome's hamburger icon change to a warning sign when mindlessly browsing the web

Thanks!
-------------------------
chrome
Great extension, no arguments about effectiveness of the functionality, one thing that would be good, and I admit, only 'would be' it's not a game-changer or anything, but the 'Extension Options' in Chrome, gives a very small popup box, and the list of sites that have been allowed previously, is therefore quite ungainly to work with. I know that most times, just working with the toggle on/off from the button is fine, but I have noticed on very rare occasions, a site might not get removed from the list, so a more visible listing would be nice. As I said, it's not a game-changer or a deal breaker, just an "I wish." Thanks for all your hard work.

You can use chrome extensions on Edge. Just go to chrome web store from Edge and install as usual.

Use Chrome storage to sync settings between PCs It'd be awesome! https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage Thanks for a good extension!

This is the best VPN and Ad-Blocker ive ever seen. Not only does it block Ads but it gives extra options to keep you safe from trackers, hackers and etc. It also allows you to choose what websites to not block ads [ Not the security, just the Ads ] which is amazing. 100% Recommended.

Best Extensions for blocking ads and malware
-------------------------
block
The best ad blocker. It blocks the most ads compared to other alternatives and has a clean design. Here are two options you might use as you surf the internet:
Right-click on the icon, and it brings up the option. You can stop it from working on particular sites by pressing "disable filtering on this website." In addition, if you notice an unblocked ad on a website click "Block ads on this website" and click on the ad that is showing up.
I would recommend it to all my friends.
-------------------------

This is the most effective ad blocking extension, I loved it and I recommend it too.

This is an impressive extension for Google Chrome - made by a few fellow developers.
It effectively blocks all obtrusive ads with no slowdowns whatsoever.

It's amazing. Works on all sites. Blocks all ads. (Video ads and image ads)
There's also a "Block element" tool in case you want to do that. 


My only complaint is that it doesn't work on Spotify anymore, but I can listen to YouTube Music ad-free, so whatever. 

This is definitely the best you can get with free ad-blockers.

Tho I like the protection, it isn't easy to modify when I have to quickly to that to get access into such simple sites as a college hockey website! PLEASE developers - contact me if you don't know how to make this user-easy! We can do this!

Went through over dozens of ad blockers to find one that also blocks page redirects, new youtube anti-ad-block ads, and many other modern day anti-ad-blocking softwares on increasingly many websites. When this ad blocker did what I wanted and much more I was satisfied enough to come back to this page, look for the review area, and type a review (which I uncommonly do for extensions and apps) to explain and express my satisfactory.
-------------------------
block
Have been using this extension from 2019 works so great blocks all annoying ads for all the people saying its malware or a virus it maybe some other extension you are using because for me even my anti-virus software says its fine

THANK YOU FOR THIS APP. ITS VERY HELPFUL. IT HAS BLOCKED 4207 ADS IN 5 DAYS IN MY PC
-------------------------
block
It is one of the best adblockers I have ever used in my life.
I tried most of the adblockers but none was perfect in blocking ads. The Adguard is absolutely a lifesaver. It takes very less time to filter pages from ads, say, milliseconds. I tried it on most of the sites such as those which says to watch some ads to move to another page and keep on watching until 20 pages through this process; Adguard filters these sites and removes all the ads and saves my previous time. Yeah bro! Time is precious!!

It saves time!!!

Excellent extension for blocking ads on the Internet!

best adblocker in the world. highly customizable. it even blocks webRTC and the toolz of tyranny cant eavesdrop on you through the browser (find it in the stealthmode settings). truly sorry I can't thank AdGuard enough for the services they provide to the free men/women gratis...

This extension is absolutely amazing and never fails it's job. It blocks basicly every ad on a website, aswell as that it has extra blocking features which can be turned on or off. Great protection from scams and bad websites in general. Definetely reccomend!

it was simple to use and fun icons, also blocks ads and keeps its words, excellent!

Seems working. Hope that the service itself doesn't collect even more data than it protects from) But advertisement & pop-up windows blocking works great! Thanks for an advanced settings, quite a good variety for a general user.

Very good it extension blocks adds on every website I love it❤
-------------------------

Really helpful! Blocks YouTube ads, social media ads, and others. Never have had an ad pop up unsolicited thus far, would recommend. In the case of websites running on ad profit, it's so easy to pause the blocker and resume activity when finished. 10/10!

Took care of the in-page video ads that pop-up blockers couldn't disable. This extension is wonderful. Also improved page performance/responsiveness by not allowing these in-page ads to render.

Nice, it makes my chrome experience better, thanks a lot.

The absolute best ad blocker for Chrome. I also use their paid product for Android. Extremely effective and feature packed.

This is amazing. I use it on my smartphone for Chrome and on my laptop for Chrome. Blocks almost all ads. Easy to use, stylish in Settings. Very good, I use free 10 Mbps internet included to rent and pages are downloading so much faster now. I do not see what to buy next, not even in Gmail. This is so amazing, you all need it now. I've been installing AdBlockers to everyone in my family. AdGuard is one which worked the best. Big plus for working on Android as well. This company is the greatest. AdGuard saved me thousands not seeing the stuff they want to sell us all year long. Thank you so much, this is bargain for free.

I really like this Ad Blocker, It works Really well, Yet, For some reason it stopped blocking YouTube ads, I'll try reinstalling it, I'll see if that works. Other than that, It's a great ad blocker!!

FINALLY FOUND AN ADBLOCKER THAT CAN "ACTUALLY" BLOCK YOUTUBE ADS!!!

this works like a charm it blocks every ad on any website and even youtube ads.the ownly downside i would have is that if you try downloading something if it tries to take you to another website it will not allow it to. but still a definite 5/5

It WORKS!!! Very useful extension, and it tells you how many ads were blocked. Thank you, now I can listen to music AD FREE. If you don't have this, get it.

Recommend to buy licences to your phone and laptop.
Chromebook is working great with the free extension.

Great job!

Works pretty good, blocks most ads, even the obnoxious ones on youtube - it's just a shame it can't block them when i cast to my tv, occasionally uninstalls itself - but all in all, is still better than the last adblocker i used.
For folks complaining; Multi Billion dollar companies shouldn't need to force feed ads to us to make money and if you looked at how much money on youtube for example, is actually given to content creators, you'd understand why sites like onlyfans and patreon exist.

This is a good ad blocker. It blocks most ads. It doesn't cause any extra loading time, and you rarely ever think about it. I would 10/10 recommend this to a friend.

I have been a user of Adguard for quite a long time and have also bought lifetime license for most of my devices (PC & Android). I do see a lot of difference with and without Adguard usage and definitely its a positive one with Adguard usage. I am not sure how much of user privacy is anonymous through Adguard but it definitely works a charm on the browsers am using. The good part of Adguard android app is that it also blocks ads on most of the other apps (Youtube is an exception).

Best of all tried.  My favored web browser (Flashpeak Slimjet, Windows & Linux) has an inbuilt ad counter & blocker, in the task bar.  My favored test site is Distrowatch.com.  AdGuard AdBlocker was the only Chromium based addon that blocked all five of the advertisements on that web site.

I can not believe how lucky I find myself after I found this gem! I was using the OTHER program that was supposed to block ads but basically were in league with ad companies! 

This program is 1000% recommended! No ads, blocks anything, clean and FAST browsing!

I loved this Ad Blocker! It was so helpful! When I'm watching YouTube, I could tell that an ad was about to show up, but then, it was quickly blocked! 5 stars! Loved it!!! P.S. It also works on many other websites!

It is one of the best ad guard you can find. It also does a lot of good work, we just have to hit the settings button and turn on some protective gears. 
I am experiencing this for about a year.

Nice AdGuard to block add. I have to say thanks to AdGuard.

Will not block ads, or sites will not let you view without deactivating AdGuard AdBlocker. When going to report an issue, it makes you go through 6 steps, including screenshots AND signing up for an account. No thanks!

It blocks ads in general, even the ones on YouTube! It'll also save you from malware downloads, it sure did save me, and I'm thankful.

Fantastic adblocker. I've been using it for the past 6 months. It has done such a great job, I don't even notice it until I use another computer and think to myself "Oh so that's what the page looks like for everyone else" noticing all the ads. The DNS servers are pretty nice too. They even block some mobile app banner ads.
-------------------------
block
This is a must-have extension. I use Google Chrome on a Chromebook and some sites are so loaded with ads that it really slowed me down. Once I got Ad Gaurd, it blocked all those annoyances so pages could load faster - and I could get on with my life. Delightfully, it required NO set up. I just installed it and it went to work. Best of all, I still have full control to block or unblock whatever I want, whenever I want.  Great app!
-------------------------
block
very nice it blocked most of the ads it great
-------------------------
block
Literally blocks every single ad in exitence. Incredibly useful, even blocks AUDIO advertisements and popups (the advertising ones). The "block ads on this webpage" button is also very useful, serving sort of as a website dissector to block intrusive parts. Statistics and user-fiendly graphs and settings round out this absolutely amazing extension.
-------------------------

Exceptional, it blocked all of my ads. Highly recommended

Very strong ad blocker. If your looking for something that blocks Ads on flash based players which are used by channel 4, channel 5 and other UK channel on demand service, this tends to work.

Powerful and Spectacular Extension 
Thanks a lot Adguard
-------------------------
block
For me, AdGuard is the best ever when compared to (beggy dev) Adblock and (lazy dev) AdBlock Plus! And I find it to be much more convenient than the arguably-best uBlock Origin, because its filters properly allow certain things to work without headache-inducing investigation of what to unblock, e.g. Also it actually blocks things much better than the others on particular sites (such as adult).

AdGuard is now on-par with uBlock Origin too, finally supporting "strict blocking." And now that uBlock Origin isn't updated much anymore (well it's being severely delayed on the Chrome Store for whatever reasons), AdGuard is the new winner in my book.

One minor quirk with AdGuard is for some reason the extension occasionally crashes, requiring it to be manually reloaded or just restart Chrome.
-------------------------
block
@Sheetza: Well, I think the UI is cleaner and modern, and the presentation of the available filter lists is also easier to understand. But what I guess I mean by more convenient is I'm finding it actually blocks a lot better in many cases without the need to tweak much. Mileage will vary, of course, but so far I'm impressed with it in comparison.
-------------------------
detect
Great.Websites can not detect this AdBlocker...
-------------------------
protect
Amazing at adblocking, and protecting against virus websites.
-------------------------
block
My favorite thing about this adblocker is its 'inverse whitelist'. I am okay with ads that are not intrusive, annoying, or ones that significantly slow down page loading. The sites that do it 'right' I want to allow them to appear. The ones that do not, I want to block them. This inverse whitelist option allows me to do exactly that.
-------------------------
block
Best Ad-blocker for me. Blocks all the unwanted pop-ups and ads. saves my bandwith and time.
-------------------------

it works! but some anti virus/spyware detect it as spyware. because of that i give 4 stars

Great for blocking ads. If you combine it with Adblock for youtube you wont get a single ad.
-------------------------
block
Overall great in blocking ads and trackers. One-stop-shop solution, instead of having to use separate extensions.
-------------------------
block
It is great at blocking ads, but not so good at block annoyances. It could block more annoying things like those floating autoplay videos, like on CNN. I hate that they autoplay AND I hate even more that they follow me floating on the page.
-------------------------

Great ad blocker...it also protects against malware, phishing, and spoofing sites. Well done! 😎👍

prevent
AdGuard offers the best protection in its class. I have tested almost all Ad traffic prevention extensions on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Chromium Browser, FireFox Browser and by far Ad Guard is best in class. I have also tested in on Android Phone. It does make loading pages ad free easy and convenient. A lot of noise is reduced by Ad Guard in comparison to what things are without it.
Highly Recommend it for every device it is available.
-------------------------

Extremely useful extension. Blocks ads from almost every website and keeps the web browsing and youtube watching experience clutter free; highly recommended. Loved it!

I have tried quite a few ad blockers in the past but this one is by far the best one you can get. 
I have never had any hassles with it nor has it been annoying to have unlike other ad blockers.
I'm quite surprised that it's even free to use, 
by the amount of options, filters and protections it offers.
p.s using Google Chrome.
-------------------------

Honestly the best extension i have ever used, I actually tested it at school since School computers have their firewall off and oh man Ad Guard blocked more than 1,000 privacy invasions. it was crazy to see more attacks on the computers than the number of ads that were blocked in a week!
-------------------------
block
yeah okay so basically i'm monkey. this app i really good would recommend and there are many reviews saying that this extension doesn't block many ads but from personal experience it has blocked all even those annoying double ads on YouTube. yeah the app is peng innit.

It blocks "sponsors" url added in local ajax delete request. Works fine with other delete requests. Please see: https://ibb.co/FJ1jvyr

Hey, I really love this extension.. And it worked the best for blocking ads on youtube for the longest time.. But now that time has ended. I think you should look into this, as this extenstion used to be the best at blocking youtube ads. It seems youtube has found another way to unblock ads once again..
-------------------------

Best in blocking pop ups and ads <3 Keep it up.
-------------------------
block
best of best but it also should block pop ups.
-------------------------
block
I almost never write a review for software but after trying this I am very pleased that it really works!  I suggest that you play with the settings because until I changed them it wasn't blocking any ads.  To make testing easier, I opened a new tab with a web page full of ads. Every time I changed the settings, I would press F5 to reload the ad page and see if my changes did anything.  Highly recommended!!!!

Overall a good AD Blocker (does not block all ads but it didn't claim to either) the main thing that stands out to me is that unlike most ad blockers it prevents most - not all but nearly all sited from opening TABs on chrome or another window on your PC (like when you steam movies)

top tier ad block ..way better than adblock plus

I love the element blocking feature on Adblock to remove distractions on websites. This deserves a 5 stars alone! Some websites don't work fully with Adblock on though with links being unclickable like on Drugs.com
-------------------------
block
blocks ads on hent...anime sites
-------------------------
block
So far it's working just fine for my environment. I specially like "whitelist" setting and it's straight-forward functionality and the "stealth" mode. Overall UI is very user-friendly. For some time I even wanted to switch to Brave browser because it has ad blocking as a default, but than I found this one so I'll stick to Chrome because of sync with all other stuff I'm using.
Thank you and keep the good work...
-------------------------
block
Do your self a favor and uninstall ad-block then get this its soooooooo much better. Also look into turning on filters that block email list pop ups on websites. Also enable the "adblock warning removal list" in filters.
-------------------------
block
I absolutely MUST have this plugin AdGuard is a ad blocking tool/extension that does a extremely good job at blocking ads but it also blocks annoyances like malware,browser miners they also have Adguard on phone!
-------------------------
block
A fantastic security extension with an amazing and attractive UI! I've been using AdGuard for the past couple years now and it has done its job perfectly, but it's way more than just a simple ad blocker. It combines the features of extensions like AdBlock, Ghostery, the Avast extension, etc. into one and does each one of those things perfectly. You have lots of control over which filters you activate so you can have as much or as little protection as you want. Thanks to its great UI, even in the rare cases when the ad blocking breaks site features, you can quickly disable and then re-enable protection to get around the break.

In general, this is a must-have for browsing safely. The only issues I've EVER encountered since installing it are the occasional broken site but as I said, it's easy and quick to temporarily disable protection to get around that until the filters are updated. Heavyweight protection with lightweight performance.

Excellent blocker; only way I could be happier would be if it also blocked the chumbox links from showing up at the bottom or sides of the pages; those things get distracting, and are almost never worth looking at.

I first used this App over a website with tons of ads that makes me so sick of it, and by the way this website is csdn.net, a Chinese website with blogs related to computer programming topics. this App really is useful, it blocks all of the stupid ads for me, now I can concentrate on the real content of the website, now I'm satisfied, there are some other websites I haven't yet tested, so I rate it a 4 star!

If you like the chrome extension try their phone app.The best part is that it blocks in-app ads!  It'll change how you relate to the internet on your phone.Its obsessively customizable and they're always adding new features.

All of their products are one time fee--no subscriptions.

Best ad blocker out there! 100% reliable, unlike desktop apps that you may even need to pay for! This is entirely FREE! I've been using it for a year and I've been entirely ad-free.

It is one of the best free ad blockers I've seen so far! I tried other ad blockers and they wanted me to pay to run their system! I love that it was free and that it actually works!

It's great!   NOW NEAT AND CLEAN WEB PAGES
But some sites do not load due their ads being blocked.
-------------------------

I've tested four adblockers before this, and it is better than all of them. It barely slows down your device (if at all), it's completely free, and it blocks every type of ad I've seen. Not only this, but it works around anti-adblockers, and shows you what it's blocked!
-------------------------
block
Blocks ads just as well as any other ad blocker extension BUT this extension doesn't block reCAPTCHAs on sites where other adblockers have blocked the captchas, so I'm happy with AdGuard!
-------------------------
block
Consistent blocking, extension up-to-date with no unexpected behavior; excellent
-------------------------
block
I rate it a 4 1/5 out of 5. Personally, I love this adblocker, it does exactly everything you need it to, it blocks you from entering a dangerous website that could possibly harm your computer or harm your privacy. Filter updates do need manually updated, which I wish could be done automatically like it scans for updates every 8 hours on and it scans every time it's been turned on when it's been longer than 8 hours since it was last updated. That would make it a 5/5.
-------------------------
block
it really works and blocks ads thank you very very very very very much!
-------------------------
block
Literally blocks all the ads, even when I go to join a Roblox server it blocks the ad that is supposed to play, and it also blocks the youtube ads. Best adblocker ever.

bypass
I used to like this adblocker, but I switched to uBlock Origin (Nano, more specifically), which felt so effective that I never wanted to go back. If I'm honest, I have a huge feeling that Adguard, based on a quick check I did with it, has decided to whitelist companies (like AdBlockPlus).
Why am I only penalising one star? Because, despite that, the interface was nice. Good job for that.

Before September 19th, 2018:
It's good, but the only problem is that Adf.ly links aren't bypassed any more.
Other than that, it's simple, stylish and effective! Well done, Adguard!
(4 stars)

Thank you! This has blocked all YouTube ads. It blocked all ads!

Good at blocking some ads that AdBlock misses.. :)
-------------------------

Works WAAAAAY better than either Adblock Plus or uBlock / uBlock Origin. Origin was bought by the guys who run ABP and is slowly going out of business. I'd rather not support the guys who bought out a once great adblocker. AdGuard, I've been told, actually works... And it does!

So far , from what I've seen, it doesn't allow pop-ups which block you from accessing their website unless you turn it off ( ie Forbes and KnowYourMeme ), and Adblock seems to allow those and has not found a way around disabling those. I hate those pop-ups! I treasure my privacy on the internet and refuse to give it up to greedy corporations who possibly have hundreds of thousands of other non-Adblocking users giving them revenue anyway. I have the right to privacy, and AdGuard definitely allows my privacy to be top priority.

I have used all adguard products for years. Getting the Adguard lifetime license for ones android phone should be required. Everyone I've introduced to it loves it. No ads on the internet with phishing and malware protection while saving data. Its a no brainer.

FINALLY! AN AD BLOCKER WHICH ACTUALLY BLOCKS ADS!
-------------------------
block
I have used ADblock Plus for the longest time and it made my browser and computer slow and freezy at some times. I was looking for something which doesn't take much resources and tried Ublock origin which it claimed to do. It was not very different from ADblock plus, i was giving up on ad blocks when i decided to give this a try and i am thankful for that. I finally got the ad block that i wanted which doesn't lag down my browser and computer and all the while doing its job perfectly. Thank you for this add-on and keep this add-on just like it is!!
-------------------------
prevent
It's great isn't it, preventing content creators from earning money from their hard work so they can pay the domain, website and hosting bills etc , no wonder more and more sites are making you pay to access content now.
-------------------------
block
it is the best AdBlocker ever. i blocks every ad and it doesn't make the computer slow
-------------------------
block
I recently had AdBlock Plus and AdBlocker for Google Chrome. Plus was very buggy, AdBlocker for Chrome was less informative about what it was blocking. Then I installed AdGuard. It TOTALLY FLATTENED AdBlock Plus and AdBlocker for Chrome! It also is a semi-antivirus software, as it can scan my computer as a desktop software. I already have good antivirus on my computer, and the two softwares together formed a faster, safer computer. Also has a cool logo:)

Best Of One Extension in Ad Block. Very Nice Ad Blocker Thanks

Excellent ad blocker, probably the best one currently out there for chrome, bar none. Blocks ads without breaking websites, greatly speeding up browsing experience, so yeah, very impressed and highly recommended.

Love it!  Blocks ads beautifully.  Works great with Hulu and CBS.

just opened the chromebook and like the issue of blocking ads.

Adguard works on some webs that would block other adblockers
-------------------------

Been using Adguard for years now. The best adblocker hands down.

I use it in conjunction with the desktop version. It does way more than simply block ads and is a security must have if one seeks to traverse the wilderness that is the world wide web ;D
-------------------------
block
I use it on every PC i put chrome on... and Firefox too...  Great way to block ads and malware.   I do wonder though,  what is the ACTUAL  "best" adblocker extension for chrome....  I would like to know, because i would probably use THAT one... 

but adguard is the best I know about right now.
-------------------------
block
I can tell you that this blocks all annoying ads. 
Except the occasional ones that sip through.
What more can you ask for!!!!

Nice work Developers ;)
-------------------------
block
Doesn't block all ads. Every now and then, one or two ads get threw on some sites like Twitch. Ads are a wast of my time. But for the most part, it works most of the time and better than other ad blockers iv'e used.
-------------------------

Amazing. Blocks every ad, and if I want to disable it, I can! Thank you, adguard.com.

Blocks all ads or Only ads I select.

Tried on few sites that were noticing my previous Adblocker and blocking content from me because of that and Adguard Adblocker was undetectable and still kept adds away from my screen.

Works like supposed to and I'm pleased. I work with adds and I EVEN I HATE THEM.

I experimented with Slimjet's 
 browser built in adblocker and store adds still visible.  Same result with Ublock origin.  After adding Adguard the store adds and Taboola were gone.  Fantastic coding guys!  I also subscribe to Adguard and the desktop application blocks ads on all browsers without needing an extension.

Better Than Ad Block +
-------------------------
block
easy to use and block ads very well in any websites and we can block any specific ads by own. so it's good
-------------------------
block
Its very good for Youtube cuz its blocking all f the adds!
-------------------------
block
Better than AdBlock, just switched Adblock out for this and it works great. AdBlock only blocked most ads and sometimes broke websites by blocking the wrong things. This does it's job well and I've had no problems with it so far.
-------------------------
block
Less intrusive and better Ad Block filtering than the majority of Ad Blocker Apps I have tried...
-------------------------
block
used adguard on mac. pretty much does it's job. doesn't really block all ads from my experience. sucked that it is only free for a short trial period.
-------------------------

Use Fair Ad Blocker by Stands - best AdBlocker, no trial, five star rating, blocks tracking and malware too!
-------------------------

Loved it, blocked ads great. Made TV easy to watch.
-------------------------

Works like a charm, and has customizable protections options depending on how much you trust the program. It's exactly what I needed to block pesky ads. Thanks!
-------------------------

Definitely the best on the market now that AdBlock+ has its own ad network that it doesn't block. This also offers the ability to block google search ads, block you from trackers, and even protect you from malicious websites. Would recommend to anyone I came across

good to block ads in Facebook

make it block popup messages in websites
in other ways it is very reliable and good being an extensionn as well as in windows
-------------------------

Adguard is one of the most effective ad filter that I have tested. 

I just think that there should be an option to enable on page blocked object indicators to unblock elements by simply clicking on an indicator shown where the element would be located on page without ad filter.
-------------------------
block
Best ad blocking software I've come across! Didn't slow anything down and very easy to turn off and on. 
Due to the extension's excellent performance, I've paid for the full software to support the developers, and that's also been worth every penny. 

I highly recommend this to everyone and will continue to do so.

Absolutely the best adblock I have ever used.  Blocks almost everything.  Blocks way more than any other blocker out there.

It blocks all ads! even the spotify ones!

awesome , if you wanna check the blocking of this extension use speedtest.com for checking, it contains like milions of Ads, which is successfully blocked by this extension.
-------------------------
block
Pros
>Sleek, works super good on hundreds of sites, probably thousands
>I like the little green sheild icon, it's nice graphic design in my opinion
>Blocks about half of the pop-up ads
>The only adblock I would reccomend. I put it on my mother's computer.
>Sites can detect it, but it's easy to disable and it remembers which sites you've toggled it off on.

Cons
>Blocks only about half of the pop-up ads
>Sometimes, seemingly, it will block hundreds of ads one at a time until it reaches "infinity", which can make older computers running Chrome slow.
-------------------------
block
This ad blocker is the best and I really like it. It blocks ads and it is really fast...usually I get annoyed by ad blockers because they slow down my device but this ad blocker is different...U should really get this
-------------------------
block
Installed it in Vivaldi. Blocked EVERY BANNER/AD! right away (at default settings) on the 3 test websites I view most often. I liked Vivaldi but it showed every possible ad on webpages. Now Vivaldi is perfect thanks to Adguard AdBlocker! Page size is reduced by 15% on average, so pages are not only clean now but load faster. Previously, I thought Vivaldi is slow. It is fast without ads.

This extension is REALLY EXTENSIVE: it has every possible type of filter, including Spyware Filter, which excludes the need to install additional anti-tracking extensions.

Thank you so much, Adguard team!

Excellent extension. I was previously using uBlock, and whilst that's also very good, it was just not use friendly and would frequently break pages. I didn't want to stop using it though because the element blocking was so good.

Then I discovered Adguard, which is lighter on resources, has better element blocking as is just so user friendly.

Love this it blocks all my malware

Great little extension. Won't surf the web without it. Adguard AdBlocker is a must have. Does a fantastic job blocking malicious  advertising. I use Vivaldi as my browser and Adguard AdBlocker was one of the first extensions I added.

Works perfectly. I forgot what ads are.

Every other extension/plugin that I've tried either stops working for a long time or doesn't block all ads.

This app is like a professional Ninja. It blocks pesky ads with skill and ease. Highly recommended. **UPDATE** 11/08/2016 There is no other ad blocker that I know of that does an absolutely excellent job of blocking ads from YouTube, Facebook and the rest. I have been using this ad blocker for several weeks now and have never had a problem on my Samsung Chromebook. If you want to be done with ads, GET ADGUARD ADBLOCKER!!!
-------------------------
block
The best Adblocker, much better than Adblock Plus, No pop ups, Bypasses adfly, blocks malware. Pretty much Adblock plus, but much better
-------------------------
block
Sometimes too secure and it blocks everything. It does the the job though!
-------------------------
block
So far I haven't had any issues and the blocking works well.  I will test memory vs ublock origin.  From what I can tell from usage (no testing) is that Adguard uses less memory.

I personally like to not block ads from certain sites that I use often and to allow good ads from Google since I find them well targeted to my interests and Adguard comes setup this way already.
-------------------------
block
So good at blocking ads, I wish you make one for my Television :P

It blocks ads and it does not ad itself. Very user friendly UI. Even my college uses it campus-wide. Keep it up!

That plugin is even better than another one, which all of us know. Adguard blocks much more advertisment that other plugins can't check!!

Omg, i love it. Thank you.
Keep it up. I will surely participate in Affiliate (or whatever it called, umm, referral) system and invite my friends!

Perfect for my use, the element blocker is perfect for removing stuff that aren't tehcnically ads, but still annoying bullshit that shouldn't be there, top notch extension :) All it's missing is the ability to block sponsored content on facebook.
-------------------------

Best AdBlock I've used. I come from Opera, where I've previously used this as it was recommended. I had to search specifically for this name in the chrome stored. It should definitely be more recommended.

This blocks Everything. Really, it shuts down every single ad in a page. It'll look weird at first, since the other common ones (AB+, etc) don't exactly do this. But it is awesome. Clean surfing.
-------------------------

Wonderful Block Extension Plugin. I just wish it didn't block most of my mainstream mediaplayback via chrome HTML5, js.flash and etc based webflash.
-------------------------

The best, #1 ad-blocker of "ad-blockers". Very efficient in blocking the most intrusive ads, smooth, light and low-key. It also blocks all the obtrusive video ads on video streaming sites like Youtube unlike AdBlocker.

You will not find a more effective ad-blocker than AdGuard. 

I recommend 100% to all.
-------------------------
detect
i love this app

use in conjunction with AdBlock Plus, Ghostery, Keyboard Privacy and nothing gets through.

Go into the advanced filter settings and enable the feature to suppress anti-adblock notifications. Some sites detect users using these applications, the setting stops their detection.

love it block all annoying ads on the web including google ads if you disable useful ads better than adblock and adblock plus or adblock pro
-------------------------

Overall it works perfectly in blocking ads.  
I think it's whitelisting system can be improved because I cannot whitelist specific Youtube channels.  I have to manually pause adguard and then turn it back on.  I find AdBlock better because of this.
-------------------------

Finally I found extension that works properly and blocks everything that I need (annoying pop ups and new browser windows that open without permissions).

Its awesome it block malicious pages as well and make websites load faster and efficiently

NICE, block all YOUTUBE ads

Works well.  Blocks most advertising - I've only seen it not block on a rare occasion where the advert has been coded directly into the website as opposed to a web service feed.

excellent blocking ads

best one ever it blocks al the annoying ads also it doesnt consume chrome megabytes so it make its run faster not like the others that makes chrome slower

I've tried Adblock, AdBlock Plus, uBlock Origin, and then this.  So far AA seems to offer the best balance of protection and cosmetics.

Best ads blocker out there! Blocks so many annoying and invasive ads, video ads, etc. Doesn't slow down browsing speed, a plus for Adguard. Can't browse the web without this tool these days. As for blocking ads, Adguard and Adblock Plus are on par. As for advanced features and extras, Adguard wins. Highly recommend Adguard over ABP.

Its real amazing and blocks ads permanently!
-------------------------
block
I love this ad blocker! It seems much more effective then Adblock or Adblock Plus, and it gives the user much more control. If an ad gets through, I can easily flag it and it gets hidden immediately. I can also see a list of all the elements on the page including which ones are being blocked and why.

Highly recommended

-------------------------
block
super, it blocks all unwanted adds and everyone can relay on it
-------------------------

The other adblock extensions, while it does block ads, uses a lot of memory, thus your computer slows down. Thankfully, adguard actually makes your computer run faster without using a ton of memory. I also found the anti malware/spyware option to be very helpful.
-------------------------
prevent
I'll try anything to prevent ads from showing up on my pages, or distracting me when I'm working on something important. Hurrah for Adguard AdBlocker...it works!
-------------------------
block
Using this since last year .....wonderful. The only little issue i have is when i reinstall windows and sign in to chrome, it doesn't block anything i have to reinstall Adguard but regardless its awesome.
-------------------------
block
It seems that this extension blocks all advertisements on programs streamed from TV channels in Australia. How good is that?
-------------------------
block
Just Amazing. I use it not only to block ads, but also to block unwanted sections of websites I use often.
-------------------------
block
Does the trick.  Blocks adds and my machine seems to be running faster on a very limited network.
-------------------------
block
I don't know how it works, but it does, and well. Very nice interface as well and it blocks everything. This is probably one of the best ad blockers on here.
-------------------------
block
very good blocked every ad i have come across and would definitely recommend it to any one and better than any other ad blocker
-------------------------
block
This is a great extension. Blocks so much S**** from my gaming experience. Love It.

-------------------------
block
blocks to many sites I want to go to like Chrome
-------------------------
block
The only ad-blocker that successfully blocks Youtube ads, among the extensions I tried, and that's a win for me. Never noticed any ads since, so it's doing it's job.
-------------------------
block
This blocker really blocks every thing.. 100% good.
-------------------------
block
Get the job done. Get rid of ads that blocking sites. Great!
-------------------------
block
It blocked all of the side ads that used to disturb me.Its simple and user friendly
SIMPLY THE BEST
-------------------------
protect
Good protection!
-------------------------
block
It's simply the best adblocker out there. It can block any ads at blazing performance with a modern look.It can be an all in one adblocker/privacy/security protection piece of software for browsing the Net.
But, I am confused what filters I can add without a performace loss because there are too many filters. By the way, I am just a newbie that's why I don't really know about this matter.
-------------------------
block
this always blocks ads whover made this is awesome, also never seen ad on this computer ever science i diwnloaded it ;), i hope president obama puts a great report on it
-------------------------
block
The best system for block elements ever, great interface and very user friendly.

-------------------------
block
block most of the ads on website i used to visit, strong and accurate manual block ads on pages as well. like it a lot and thanks a lot !
-------------------------
block
Uses more RAM and CPU than uBlock but it's still way better than ABP and has a cleaner UI. The extra layer of privacy and malware blocking is a nice touch.
-------------------------
block
The BEST . Too Much Better Than AdBlock (Adblock Not Blocking Some of Ads For me Now).. 
Some Pop-up Issue Needs to Be Fixed in it. Other wise it's really Great Extension..

I LOVE this extension. Does not cause any problems with my computer EVER. Has blocked tons of ads and popus. I feel so much more secure. I even loaded it on  my friend's MAC. I don't think any program will block all popups and ads and this one is totally free. Thank you adguard guys (or girls)
-------------------------
block
Excellent, no other way to descride it.
Blocks all adds you want, easy to use. I've not got one bad to say about this. 
By far the best one I've come across.
-------------------------
block
Just added this app will evaluate further to change rating if it proves to be better than others like this that I have used...I think its okay but it does not block all ads or prevent popups as stated.... otherwise it is a cool app
-------------------------
block
A great tool that has great features like warnings for phishing sites and malicious sites, social network widget filter, and a tool not to have companies spy on you. It also blocks Ads! It's so great at what it does, I switched over from adblock. :)
-------------------------

best ad protection ive used. love never seeing youtube ads too!
-------------------------
block
It is best adgaurd. It blocks all ads.
-------------------------
block
One of my favorite features is to use the "Block ad on this website" to block the share buttons. I hate those and it is nice to finally have them gone!
-------------------------
block
The best extention on chrome. Definitely better than ad block plus.
-------------------------
block
Fantastic app. works on all browsers blocks every single ad, pop up, like box, so far!!!!!!!

Blocked tons of ads -- whew!  They were so annoying.

BEST BEST. Youtube ad blocked. EPIC.

Good, would be 5 stars but it prevents netflix from playing, not much of an issue, just switch it off when I stream, still, it'd be nice to get that fixed.

Absolutely stunning extension, works like a charm and blocks all irritating ads, popups, floaters, you name it, this will block it.
Just wondering why I never installed it before today. Thanks a lot developers.
-------------------------
protect
Definitely feel protected and seems really effective. It's a hell of a lot more polished than 90% of the extensions you find on here.
-------------------------
block
Fantastic, a free extension that makes using the internet a much better experience.I only wished it blocked MORE ads, like those pop-up banner ads on the top and bottom of pages.
-------------------------
block
Working better than the standaard Ad Block programs
-------------------------
block
Better than adblock, new standard for older people, and kids (#1 way to block bad downloads imo)
-------------------------
block
just one of the best Adblockers i could find and have. I was skeptical at first, and then, NO MORE YOUTUBE ADS! and blocks crappy sites that would be harmful. All in all, a really great adblocker. and i mean GREAT
-------------------------
protect
GREAT GREAT GREASTEST AD PROTECTION ON MARKET! FOR FREE!!
-------------------------
block
Blocking is much speedier than AdBlock Plus. Sites loaded with ads load much, much faster using AdGuard than when you try with ABP.
-------------------------
block
This is the only adblock extension for Chrome that actually blocks the ads on YouTube. Great extension!
-------------------------
block
excellent app ....works perfect in blocking unwanted ads
-------------------------

I was struggling with lots of adds, When new page opened. Thanks to Adguard AdBlocker. Which made to block all the adds. Which made life easier.
-------------------------

great ad block. im loving it. but can it work with other extensions as well?
-------------------------

Awesome ad blocker, unbelievable, you can also set special user filters to block certain ads on the page !!!

EXCELLENT!! God of all AD Block WELL DONE!! :))
-------------------------
block
AdGuard is the best ad blocking software that I have ever used.  It is far more capable than any adblock.
-------------------------
block
the best I got until now. I'm extremely strict. even in the worst sites are blocked. thank you very much Adguard.
-------------------------
protect
one of the best web protection. I like this coz it is simple, all feastures are very useful and very light.
-------------------------
block
loving it--and quite frankly SHOCKED to see just how many ads it has blocked.  OOO-wee!
-------------------------
block
Seems to block the LastPass ad in the LastPass vault completely in Chrome;  in Opera, the space occupied by the ad is still there. This ad is one of the harder ads to block at all, so I give Adblock 4 stars.
-------------------------
block
Very good ad/malware blocker and you can use it's full ad blocking functionality for free.
-------------------------
protect
The best ad blocker with real phishing protection!
-------------------------
block
I like it! It's blocking a lot of ads indeed.
-------------------------
block
Very nice blocks only unwanted ads
-------------------------
block
So far so good. But please fix the issue with blocking popups initiated by other Chrome extensions, i.e. Buffer App. Cheers!
-------------------------
block
All Ads blocked thus makes you feel lighter. But most importantly it also makes your PC & browser feel lighter too!
-------------------------
block
Very Amazing App!!!!!! Very Helpful To Block Ads! Five-Star!!
-------------------------
block
This is awesome! No more crappy ads, and my vids seemingly load faster too! yaaas lord.
I'd recommend this before i recommend Adblocker or ABP. 

Had it for a week or two, and its blocked over 12,000 ads. Good thing too, cause i have like 12 tabs open daily. :3
-------------------------
block
Have to give this extension a cautious 5 stars. Advice: you don't need the full version if you simply want to block ads, tracking, social media and malware effectively, so comments like 'wish this was free' are null and void. It is free, and I've tried the 'full version' to compare. There are some niggles but on balance this is more effective, and faster, than ABP or any other ad blocker I've tried in Chrome. I'm also now an 'ex-Ghostery user' - does what Ghostery does but blocks the ads as well. The UI is excellent as well. I'm no fan boy btw - I've tested them all and I'm simply sharing my current views
-------------------------
block
It's better than ABP in English Websites, but it almost do not block ads on Chinese Websites, otherwise it will be perfect. Please improve this issue.
-------------------------
block
I want the app to do two more things:

1) Update itself automatically, no need to manual update.

2) Option to block only video and audio ads. The banner-like and other ads are acceptable, since many websites I like rely on these banner ads for sustenance, I can accept viewing them. NOT THE VIDEO ADS NOR PANDORA ADS, those are evil. 

O, and the app works amazingly.
-------------------------
block
customize blocking seems to be simpler than the others
-------------------------
block
Over 3000 ads blocked in mere 3 days, with no disruption to browsing. Excellent, invisible app
-------------------------
block
amazing, better then ad block! the memory usage is low too!
-------------------------
block
Ran a side by side test with ABP, Ghostery, Adblocker & Adguard. Adguard consistently blocked more elements than the others. I didn't bother with a RAM usage test because my Macbook has had absolutely no issues. I think this one wins on my unscientific test. It gets my thumbs-up vote.
-------------------------
block
Wonderful!
Love that it blocks the YouTube ad at the top right.
-------------------------
block
it blocks both pop ups and ads and is better than adblock
-------------------------
block
Couple this with ABP then you got the ultimate blocking machine!
-------------------------
block
Simple to use and blocked an annoying malware that appeared on all of my macs.  Removing cookies didn't do it, but Adguard did.  Bravo!
-------------------------
block
This is the best adblocker on the block IMO. The interface is nicer and more professional than any of the other adblockers for chrome, it seems to block ads just as well, and has lower resource usage than adblock plus.
-------------------------
block
The best anti-banner software I ever used.
Blocks all nonsense ads, offers child safety features, and prevents viruses and malware to entering the system.
I am glad that it doeesn't slow down my system neither it uses extra system resources.
Indeed, it's a great addition to cutting edge technology!
-------------------------
block
Awesome to use adguard adblocker.
It's more than its worth for being an efficient ad killer.
Offers cool features to block adult content too.
Uses low ram and gives excellent results.
I'm a big fan of this app for all it offers!
-------------------------
block
Best ad killer I found so far.
Blocks ads from the starting point when they start loading.
never opens any adult website if the parental control feature is enabled.
virus, malware etc etc is no more an issue.
Muaaaaaaah!
-------------------------
block
It's really a wise pick for professionals.
Blocks all wicked ads even if they are textual or audio-visual.
Speed is also great that makes it beat adblock plus.
Most of all, it's unique because of its parental control feature.
It impressed me!
-------------------------
block
Blessed to get this mighty app to block stupid ads!
-------------------------
block
Adblocking genius it is!
Performance and efficiency wise, it's much better than adblock plus.
An alternative to latest technology tools for it blocks all ads online.
Protects from all menaces 24/7.
Awesome app!
-------------------------

Bravo add-on...
Starts blocking ads even when the page starts loading.
It's better than adblock plus because it blocks ads where AB+ leaves.
An awesome tool thaat also provides protection from potential threats.
I Love it!
-------------------------
block
Amazing tool for blocking unnecessary adds and malicious attacks
-------------------------
block
I must say this is truly fast and lightweight than ABP, I just opened a couple of websites that have lots of ads and it blocked it with default settings, and it consumed less memory than ABP for about 50%.. AWESOME.. hope to see more of your updates
-------------------------
block
Very simple to use. This extension is better suited for novices than other ad block extensions. The options feature a simple click switch style buttons that you can select for the level of ad blocking which includes malware, spyware & others. It blocks very well as it uses the blocking lists that are used by other ad blocking extensions such as Ad Block Plus

It does indeed use less memory than other ad blocking extensions as well.

You can also custom block elements or urls. Though the process may be different than you expect. You must click on the Ad Block button, then click on "Block Ad On This Website", from there you can hover your mouse above any element which highlights it, and can ad the block rule to your user filter list. Not the usual right click as you expect. A white list is included as well so you can make exceptions for ads you do want to see.

Overall it's a good ad blocking extension. It's simple to use, & light on memory compared to other comparable extensions.

This is truly the best adblock! 

I have tried others but most of them would not block every ad. Also they would not block ads on Youtube. 

Adguard blocks all ads! I have never had an ad get past this adblock.

Love this ad blocker! 
Better than ad block:
1. Fast
2. Low resource usage
3. Good design
4. More features, like malware blocking

The other side - upselling windows version. Could be disabled in settings.

I've been using Adguard extension on Chrome/Yandex and on mobile (paid) for years. I was completely satisfied with it but today is started showing adds both in videos and other places on both my PC and mobile device. It seems that Adguard finally gave it in to the big companies and got compromised... It's sad to see one of my favourite adblockers go... as a Technical IT engineer I've been recommending this Adblocker above all for years for my friends, colleagues and everyone I've met and had troubles with ads. From now on I'll do the exact opposite. Thank you for the years of hard work Adguard and its developers. You served us well. Much appreciated up to now.

Just installed on all my PCs, I love it ! Finally can watch movies without the pop-ups and pages load MUCH faster in all. Take your time to fiddle with the adjustments, but it works great out of the box.

The best ad blocker out there and it's free! I recommend.

Good ad blocker, also protect from phishing pages, for example if I type .com instead of .net, it'll warn me if it a phishing page.

love it. It works great and no problems. would highly recommend it to anyone...

Took care of the in-page video ads that pop-up blockers couldn't disable. This extension is wonderful. Also improved page performance/responsiveness by not allowing these in-page ads to render.

Nice, it makes my chrome experience better, thanks a lot.

The absolute best ad blocker for Chrome. I also use their paid product for Android. Extremely effective and feature packed.

Nice, it makes my chrome experience better, thanks a lot.

The best company and the best product. I loved it totally. Its a total relief if you are looking for minimalist (i mean no crappy ads) browsing experience. Its a must software tool. Its just easy to set-up and with a little tweak, you're good to go. The User Interface (UI) is easy, fluid, fast, cool. Its a free extension.

I mean what more do you want, just go and installl this extension, and if you want total minimalist (i mean no crappy ads) then do buy the paid plan for the PC version, or the Phone Version as per your convenience. Go for It.

It is definitely my first option, it helps keeps annoying ads away and pop up ads! You probably think wow this company writes their own comments but this is true by a real user of this extension like trust me I was like wow seems to good to be true but now i know why everyone likes it!

Eliminates those annoying jumpy, psychotic ads. What a difference!

This is a must-have extension. I use Google Chrome on a Chromebook and some sites are so loaded with ads that it really slowed me down. Once I got Ad Gaurd, it blocked all those annoyances so pages could load faster - and I could get on with my life. Delightfully, it required NO set up. I just installed it and it went to work. Best of all, I still have full control to block or unblock whatever I want, whenever I want.  Great app!

Literally blocks every single ad in exitence. Incredibly useful, even blocks AUDIO advertisements and popups (the advertising ones). The "block ads on this webpage" button is also very useful, serving sort of as a website dissector to block intrusive parts. Statistics and user-fiendly graphs and settings round out this absolutely amazing extension.

I've been using this app "Ad Blocker," for about 8-10 Months now. Not once have I had any problem with this app.! AD Blocker does exactly what it's supposed to do! It takes away all the annoying ads online, that I use to deal with before installing this app! The only time I have to disable Ad Blocker, if I want to play any game that requires using flash player. Since this App. is designed to get rid of all ads on websites? It's very easy to just disable this app. Then re-enable the AD Blocker, once your done playing at a site that uses flash. 
This has been an excellent app for me to use & I love it!

My favorite thing about this adblocker is its 'inverse whitelist'. I am okay with ads that are not intrusive, annoying, or ones that significantly slow down page loading. The sites that do it 'right' I want to allow them to appear. The ones that do not, I want to block them. This inverse whitelist option allows me to do exactly that.

Best Ad-blocker for me. Blocks all the unwanted pop-ups and ads. saves my bandwith and time.

I use this one because it gets all those annoying "sponsored' blurb 'news' items off Yahoo as well as all the other annoying ads off the other sites I use. Thanks, AdGuard!
-------------------------
annoy
It is great at blocking ads, but not so good at block annoyances. It could block more annoying things like those floating autoplay videos, like on CNN. I hate that they autoplay AND I hate even more that they follow me floating on the page.
-------------------------
annoy
I have tried quite a few ad blockers in the past but this one is by far the best one you can get. 
I have never had any hassles with it nor has it been annoying to have unlike other ad blockers.
I'm quite surprised that it's even free to use, 
by the amount of options, filters and protections it offers.
p.s using Google Chrome.

yeah okay so basically i'm monkey. this app i really good would recommend and there are many reviews saying that this extension doesn't block many ads but from personal experience it has blocked all even those annoying double ads on YouTube. yeah the app is peng innit.

Best ad blocker out there! 100% reliable, unlike desktop apps that you may even need to pay for! This is entirely FREE! I've been using it for a year and I've been entirely ad-free.

Works WAAAAAY better than either Adblock Plus or uBlock / uBlock Origin. Origin was bought by the guys who run ABP and is slowly going out of business. I'd rather not support the guys who bought out a once great adblocker. AdGuard, I've been told, actually works... And it does!

So far , from what I've seen, it doesn't allow pop-ups which block you from accessing their website unless you turn it off ( ie Forbes and KnowYourMeme ), and Adblock seems to allow those and has not found a way around disabling those. I hate those pop-ups! I treasure my privacy on the internet and refuse to give it up to greedy corporations who possibly have hundreds of thousands of other non-Adblocking users giving them revenue anyway. I have the right to privacy, and AdGuard definitely allows my privacy to be top priority.
-------------------------
paid
I recommend using this if you watch on crunchy roll a lot.. it doesn't work well on VRV (thank goodness)please turn it off if you are watching a youtuber and twitch streamers,etc.. that you like because they won't get paid by the people who shows ads on their streams, videos, etc..

Pros
>Sleek, works super good on hundreds of sites, probably thousands
>I like the little green sheild icon, it's nice graphic design in my opinion
>Blocks about half of the pop-up ads
>The only adblock I would reccomend. I put it on my mother's computer.
>Sites can detect it, but it's easy to disable and it remembers which sites you've toggled it off on.

Cons
>Blocks only about half of the pop-up ads
>Sometimes, seemingly, it will block hundreds of ads one at a time until it reaches "infinity", which can make older computers running Chrome slow.

My preferred ad-blocker after trying many of the available options. Very efficient, haven't had false-positive issues, more  customizable even in simple ways (can disable counter on extension icon, something that annoys me to see but others don't offer the option) which can be impactful to a user's experience.

Easily comes highly; it gives you more while using less.

It works just fine... keeps all that ridiculous flashy annoying distracting... etc... out of my face... system seems to run more smoothly. I don't expect it to work 100%... no software or whatever is that perfect anymore (Bring Back DOS!). Like I said Aguard Adblocker does a good enough job for me, and I expect whatever the dislikes are, the crew involved in it's development will attend to those worries in due time... so just set it and forget it... Oh! and another Special Feature... it's Free! Keep up the Great Work People! Thanks for your hard thoughtful work and contribution to the "Keep Johnny's Chromebook Fun to Use" project.

Superb AdBlocker. It eliminated the extremely annoying ads on Yahoo Mail which often competed with my mouse and computer for attention slowing it down by lots. Annoying indeed, i'd say.

The best ad blocker. It blocks the most ads compared to other alternatives and has a clean design. Here are two options you might use as you surf the internet:
Right-click on the icon, and it brings up the option. You can stop it from working on particular sites by pressing "disable filtering on this website." In addition, if you notice an unblocked ad on a website click "Block ads on this website" and click on the ad that is showing up.

For me, AdGuard is the best ever when compared to (beggy dev) Adblock and (lazy dev) AdBlock Plus! And I find it to be much more convenient than the arguably-best uBlock Origin, because its filters properly allow certain things to work without headache-inducing investigation of what to unblock, e.g. Also it actually blocks things much better than the others on particular sites (such as adult).

AdGuard is now on-par with uBlock Origin too, finally supporting "strict blocking." And now that uBlock Origin isn't updated much anymore (well it's being severely delayed on the Chrome Store for whatever reasons), AdGuard is the new winner in my book.

One minor quirk with AdGuard is for some reason the extension occasionally crashes, requiring it to be manually reloaded or just restart Chrome.

My favorite thing about this adblocker is its 'inverse whitelist'. I am okay with ads that are not intrusive, annoying, or ones that significantly slow down page loading. The sites that do it 'right' I want to allow them to appear. The ones that do not, I want to block them. This inverse whitelist option allows me to do exactly that.
-------------------------

This is probably the best ad blocker ever. The only problem is that sometimes it speeds up the loading on some websites, but also slows down some websites too. Nevertheless, it's a great ad blocker and I highly recommend it.

AdGuard offers the best protection in its class. I have tested almost all Ad traffic prevention extensions on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Chromium Browser, FireFox Browser and by far Ad Guard is best in class. I have also tested in on Android Phone. It does make loading pages ad free easy and convenient. A lot of noise is reduced by Ad Guard in comparison to what things are without it.
Highly Recommend it for every device it is available.
-------------------------
reload
I almost never write a review for software but after trying this I am very pleased that it really works!  I suggest that you play with the settings because until I changed them it wasn't blocking any ads.  To make testing easier, I opened a new tab with a web page full of ads. Every time I changed the settings, I would press F5 to reload the ad page and see if my changes did anything.  Highly recommended!!!!
-------------------------
bug
I was so happy when I found AdGuard 4 years ago. I tried several other adblockers, but none of those were so efficient. And in case there's something that bugs me (e.g. a subscribe banner or a floating thingy on the bottom of the screen) just a few clicks and it's gone!

No more google ads, I can enjoy the FB and YT videos without interruption, so for me, AdGuard is the best!

Great ad blocker works all the time and has great design and it will warn me about certain pagfes and stop my information from going to third party sites

This is really good since it stops a lot of ads popping up

break
A fantastic security extension with an amazing and attractive UI! I've been using AdGuard for the past couple years now and it has done its job perfectly, but it's way more than just a simple ad blocker. It combines the features of extensions like AdBlock, Ghostery, the Avast extension, etc. into one and does each one of those things perfectly. You have lots of control over which filters you activate so you can have as much or as little protection as you want. Thanks to its great UI, even in the rare cases when the ad blocking breaks site features, you can quickly disable and then re-enable protection to get around the break.

In general, this is a must-have for browsing safely. The only issues I've EVER encountered since installing it are the occasional broken site but as I said, it's easy and quick to temporarily disable protection to get around that until the filters are updated. Heavyweight protection with lightweight performance.

Honestly, best free ad blocker I've ever had. However, recently it has stopped blocking some other ads but it's still reliable. Definitely recommend.

Works WAAAAAY better than either Adblock Plus or uBlock / uBlock Origin. Origin was bought by the guys who run ABP and is slowly going out of business. I'd rather not support the guys who bought out a once great adblocker. AdGuard, I've been told, actually works... And it does!

So far , from what I've seen, it doesn't allow pop-ups which block you from accessing their website unless you turn it off ( ie Forbes and KnowYourMeme ), and Adblock seems to allow those and has not found a way around disabling those. I hate those pop-ups! I treasure my privacy on the internet and refuse to give it up to greedy corporations who possibly have hundreds of thousands of other non-Adblocking users giving them revenue anyway. I have the right to privacy, and AdGuard definitely allows my privacy to be top priority.

Websites have been revising their code - Drudge Report is only one, but the ads were impossible to stop with any other ad blocker. If you are running Adguard, you need to add this custom filter to your list:
drudgereport.com#%#Object.defineProperty(window,'adonisConnType',{get:function(){},set:function(){throw'Adguard: stopped a script execution.'}});

IT WORKS. Drudge is back to being ad-free, and life is good. Mama has a brand new ad blocker - Adguard!

Installed it in Vivaldi. Blocked EVERY BANNER/AD! right away (at default settings) on the 3 test websites I view most often. I liked Vivaldi but it showed every possible ad on webpages. Now Vivaldi is perfect thanks to Adguard AdBlocker! Page size is reduced by 15% on average, so pages are not only clean now but load faster. Previously, I thought Vivaldi is slow. It is fast without ads.

This extension is REALLY EXTENSIVE: it has every possible type of filter, including Spyware Filter, which excludes the need to install additional anti-tracking extensions.

Thank you so much, Adguard team!

Right-click on the icon, and it brings up the option. You can stop it from working on particular sites by pressing "disable filtering on this website." In addition, if you notice an unblocked ad on a website click "Block ads on this website" and click on the ad that is showing up.

For me, AdGuard is the best ever when compared to (beggy dev) Adblock and (lazy dev) AdBlock Plus! And I find it to be much more convenient than the arguably-best uBlock Origin, because its filters properly allow certain things to work without headache-inducing investigation of what to unblock, e.g. Also it actually blocks things much better than the others on particular sites (such as adult).

AdGuard is now on-par with uBlock Origin too, finally supporting "strict blocking." And now that uBlock Origin isn't updated much anymore (well it's being severely delayed on the Chrome Store for whatever reasons), AdGuard is the new winner in my book.

One minor quirk with AdGuard is for some reason the extension occasionally crashes, requiring it to be manually reloaded or just restart Chrome.

I was so happy when I found AdGuard 4 years ago. I tried several other adblockers, but none of those were so efficient. And in case there's something that bugs me (e.g. a subscribe banner or a floating thingy on the bottom of the screen) just a few clicks and it's gone!

No more google ads, I can enjoy the FB and YT videos without interruption, so for me, AdGuard is the best!

Also, it seems to be just as good, (if not better even) than my other 3 installed Blockers. (Ublock Origin,Ublock Origin Extra, and Nano Adblocker)

By the way, if you're reading this, I HIGHLY recommend you add those 3 Blockers I mentioned above. They ALL play nice together with no "bumping heads".. 😜

i only give 4 stars because i have to manually update the filters even though its set to update automatically. still is better than the other adblockers.

I've been using Adguard since Dec. 2017. Other than telling me I've added my own "rule" to filter, I've had no issues with the app. I haven't deleted the rule because I was thinking it might have been from a software update? I probably should ask. (Gee, ya think?) I've told it to knock it off in the future but it just laughs at me. Other than the one act of self indulgence, it's a great app. Thank You.

manual
I rate it a 4 1/5 out of 5. Personally, I love this adblocker, it does exactly everything you need it to, it blocks you from entering a dangerous website that could possibly harm your computer or harm your privacy. Filter updates do need manually updated, which I wish could be done automatically like it scans for updates every 8 hours on and it scans every time it's been turned on when it's been longer than 8 hours since it was last updated. That would make it a 5/5.

Love this app, eventhough most of the sites I visit do every thing they can to try to get me to turn it off!!  I have always had great results with this service.  Thank you!

Works WAAAAAY better than either Adblock Plus or uBlock / uBlock Origin. Origin was bought by the guys who run ABP and is slowly going out of business. I'd rather not support the guys who bought out a once great adblocker. AdGuard, I've been told, actually works... And it does!

So far , from what I've seen, it doesn't allow pop-ups which block you from accessing their website unless you turn it off ( ie Forbes and KnowYourMeme ), and Adblock seems to allow those and has not found a way around disabling those. I hate those pop-ups! I treasure my privacy on the internet and refuse to give it up to greedy corporations who possibly have hundreds of thousands of other non-Adblocking users giving them revenue anyway. I have the right to privacy, and AdGuard definitely allows my privacy to be top priority.

I recommend using this if you watch on crunchy roll a lot.. it doesn't work well on VRV (thank goodness)please turn it off if you are watching a youtuber and twitch streamers,etc.. that you like because they won't get paid by the people who shows ads on their streams, videos, etc..

It blocks everything! Including important popups regarding registration forms, downloads, etc., so you need to keep that in mind and just remember to turn it off for those sites. I love it!

I have found this ad-blocker very useful and it works great. I have also been saved a couple of times from sketchy links and such.

Best ad blocking software I've come across! Didn't slow anything down and very easy to turn off and on.

I highly recommend this to everyone and will continue to do so.

Pros
>Sleek, works super good on hundreds of sites, probably thousands
>I like the little green sheild icon, it's nice graphic design in my opinion
>Blocks about half of the pop-up ads
>The only adblock I would reccomend. I put it on my mother's computer.
>Sites can detect it, but it's easy to disable and it remembers which sites you've toggled it off on.

Cons
>Blocks only about half of the pop-up ads
>Sometimes, seemingly, it will block hundreds of ads one at a time until it reaches "infinity", which can make older computers running Chrome slow.

LOVE THIS EXTENSION!!  I deleted it by mistake (while cleaning up junk off my computer) and hold pop-up!!!!  You don't realize what an amazing job it does until it is removed.  My computer screen was filled with ads.  I quickly added Ad Guard Back and wa-la .... pop ups be gone.  AND what is so great too is, if you need to turn it off for a specific site it is so easy to do!  I love this extension - just love it.  NOBODY Loves all those intrusive pop-ups, and thanks to this extension I no longer have to see them!  I highly recommend this!

This adblocker is one of the best. I have downloaded as many adblockers as I could find and ran them individually (one at a time, no other adblockers). This adblocker worked far better than any others. I lets you set up individual rules and monitors the results. When the ads are able to violate the existing rules, it compares all recorded data, not just from your computer, but from all those who use adblocker. It will make a new filter based on the total information gathered from all other users. All filter rules created by adguard can be used, modified, or turned off by the user in order to give full control to the end users. Nice intelligent rules for either a shotgun approach or a sniper (very accurate and specific) approach. Exelent design, and full control by the user.

I want the app to do two more things:

1) Update itself automatically, no need to manual update.

2) Option to block only video and audio ads. The banner-like and other ads are acceptable, since many websites I like rely on these banner ads for sustenance, I can accept viewing them. NOT THE VIDEO ADS NOR PANDORA ADS, those are evil. 

O, and the app works amazingly.
-------------------------
click
Very simple to use. This extension is better suited for novices than other ad block extensions. The options feature a simple click switch style buttons that you can select for the level of ad blocking which includes malware, spyware & others. It blocks very well as it uses the blocking lists that are used by other ad blocking extensions such as Ad Block Plus

It does indeed use less memory than other ad blocking extensions as well.

You can also custom block elements or urls. Though the process may be different than you expect. You must click on the Ad Block button, then click on "Block Ad On This Website", from there you can hover your mouse above any element which highlights it, and can ad the block rule to your user filter list. Not the usual right click as you expect. A white list is included as well so you can make exceptions for ads you do want to see.

Overall it's a good ad blocking extension. It's simple to use, & light on memory compared to other comparable extensions.

It is one of the best adblockers I have ever used in my life.
I tried most of the adblockers but none was perfect in blocking ads. The Adguard is absolutely a lifesaver. It takes very less time to filter pages from ads, say, milliseconds. I tried it on most of the sites such as those which says to watch some ads to move to another page and keep on watching until 20 pages through this process; Adguard filters these sites and removes all the ads and saves my previous time. Yeah bro! Time is precious!!

It saves time!!!

I've been using AdGuard (Desktop, Extension and Android app) for about 2 years and absolutely love it.  Those leaving poor reviews advising that it doesn't work are users that don't know how to configure and customize the filters properly and thus have a sub-par experience.

I recently began having "breakthrough" ads appear, however that problem was solved after I updated my filters, and learned a bit about making my own filters....which is quite a useful tutorial provided by the Adguard developers. I thank the developers for supplying that particular educational tool! I think 
that if people just exerted the same amount of energy they use to complain about particular services (such as Adguard) into learning from the educational programs provided by those services (free of charge, mind you) they would have much, much less to complain about! I mean honestly, have humans really devolved to the point that they have become so incredibly lazy that they literally will refuse to lift a finger on their own behalf, even when the tools to correct the problem are provided for FREE?? What a sad, sad commentary regarding modern Humanity! I give FIVE STARS to Adguard for both its application as well as their tutorials which they make available to users for FREE!!!
-------------------------
filter
Filter ads much better than every adblocker out their (Tested it myself) and also uses less cpu comparing to others.
-------------------------
filter
For me, AdGuard is the best ever when compared to (beggy dev) Adblock and (lazy dev) AdBlock Plus! And I find it to be much more convenient than the arguably-best uBlock Origin, because its filters properly allow certain things to work without headache-inducing investigation of what to unblock, e.g. Also it actually blocks things much better than the others on particular sites (such as adult).

AdGuard is now on-par with uBlock Origin too, finally supporting "strict blocking." And now that uBlock Origin isn't updated much anymore (well it's being severely delayed on the Chrome Store for whatever reasons), AdGuard is the new winner in my book.

One minor quirk with AdGuard is for some reason the extension occasionally crashes, requiring it to be manually reloaded or just restart Chrome.
-------------------------
filter
@Sheetza: Well, I think the UI is cleaner and modern, and the presentation of the available filter lists is also easier to understand. But what I guess I mean by more convenient is I'm finding it actually blocks a lot better in many cases without the need to tweak much. Mileage will vary, of course, but so far I'm impressed with it in comparison.
-------------------------

My favorite thing about this adblocker is its 'inverse whitelist'. I am okay with ads that are not intrusive, annoying, or ones that significantly slow down page loading. The sites that do it 'right' I want to allow them to appear. The ones that do not, I want to block them. This inverse whitelist option allows me to do exactly that.

A fantastic security extension with an amazing and attractive UI! I've been using AdGuard for the past couple years now and it has done its job perfectly, but it's way more than just a simple ad blocker. It combines the features of extensions like AdBlock, Ghostery, the Avast extension, etc. into one and does each one of those things perfectly. You have lots of control over which filters you activate so you can have as much or as little protection as you want. Thanks to its great UI, even in the rare cases when the ad blocking breaks site features, you can quickly disable and then re-enable protection to get around the break.

In general, this is a must-have for browsing safely. The only issues I've EVER encountered since installing it are the occasional broken site but as I said, it's easy and quick to temporarily disable protection to get around that until the filters are updated. Heavyweight protection with lightweight performance.

I used to like this adblocker, but I switched to uBlock Origin (Nano, more specifically), which felt so effective that I never wanted to go back. If I'm honest, I have a huge feeling that Adguard, based on a quick check I did with it, has decided to whitelist companies (like AdBlockPlus).
Why am I only penalising one star? Because, despite that, the interface was nice. Good job for that.

Before September 19th, 2018:
It's good, but the only problem is that Adf.ly links aren't bypassed any more.

Websites have been revising their code - Drudge Report is only one, but the ads were impossible to stop with any other ad blocker. If you are running Adguard, you need to add this custom filter to your list:

Усталяваў у Vivaldi. Заблакаваліся УСЕ БАНЕРЫ/РЭКЛАМА (на стандартных наладах) на 3 тэставых сайтах, якія я наведваю найбольш часта. Мне падабаўся Vivaldi, але ён паказваў усю магчымую рэкламу.

Installed it in Vivaldi. Blocked EVERY BANNER/AD! right away (at default settings) on the 3 test websites I view most often. I liked Vivaldi but it showed every possible ad on webpages. Now Vivaldi is perfect thanks to Adguard AdBlocker! Page size is reduced by 15% on average, so pages are not only clean now but load faster. Previously, I thought Vivaldi is slow. It is fast without ads.

This extension is REALLY EXTENSIVE: it has every possible type of filter, including Spyware Filter, which excludes the need to install additional anti-tracking extensions.

-------------------------
filter
Chrome browser performance improved since switching from Adblock to Adguard. I also like the loooong list of filters and annoyance removals.
-------------------------
whitelist
Top Notch blocker; blocks every ad i can't see!  even has easy options for whitelisting a site temporarily or not.
-------------------------
filter
Best adblocker i've used on Chrome, have been using it for several months. Particularly love the ability to whitelist individual filters that are part of the lists which is really handy if filter causes an issue with a feature on a site. Much easier than making and maintaining your own list without the offending filter.
-------------------------
filter
Great all the popups are filtered out...!
Thanks Adguard..!
-------------------------
whitelist
Overall it works perfectly in blocking ads.  
I think it's whitelisting system can be improved because I cannot whitelist specific Youtube channels.  I have to manually pause adguard and then turn it back on.  I find AdBlock better because of this.
-------------------------
filter
It's only been one week since I started using this. I removed Adblock + due to it's quirkiness. This APP provides easy to use custom filtering.
-------------------------
filter
Better than Adblock or Adblock Plus.It's the best adblocker but you've to keep updating your Filter from Settings menu. Loved it!
:):):):):)!
-------------------------
list
I love this ad blocker! It seems much more effective then Adblock or Adblock Plus, and it gives the user much more control. If an ad gets through, I can easily flag it and it gets hidden immediately. I can also see a list of all the elements on the page including which ones are being blocked and why.

Highly recommended
-------------------------
list
Way sick. Just tested this alongside both Adblock Plus and AdBlock, and it is definitely a step above.

At first, I was like "Oh great, more options to configure". But after taking the 2 minutes to go through them, I'm glad I did. This has way more list options available to the user.

Overall, very nice interface and functions smooth.
-------------------------
filter
works for me ...filters out and blocks all unwanted crap, that tries to come through the web.
-------------------------
filter
Meets the promise of using less memory than AdBlocker.
Simple settings UI, adjustable filters, and easy whitelisting makes this extension THE BEST!

(Also doesn't interfere with Magic Actions)
-------------------------
filter
It's simply the best adblocker out there. It can block any ads at blazing performance with a modern look.It can be an all in one adblocker/privacy/security protection piece of software for browsing the Net.
But, I am confused what filters I can add without a performace loss because there are too many filters. By the way, I am just a newbie that's why I don't really know about this matter.
-------------------------
filter
Very nice.  Avoid some odd web page issues when using other classic ad blockers.  Auto load different filters list based on web pages visited, very clever.  Thanks
-------------------------
filter
A great tool that has great features like warnings for phishing sites and malicious sites, social network widget filter, and a tool not to have companies spy on you. It also blocks Ads! It's so great at what it does, I switched over from adblock. :)
-------------------------
filter
Awesome ad blocker, unbelievable, you can also set special user filters to block certain ads on the page !!!
I tried Ad Block Plus and firefox started to hang and chrome too.
-------------------------
filter
Although I loved the AdBlock stuff, you had to download and install soooo many different ones. This one is an "All in One". Less of a Memory Hog then the others.

Filters constantly updated!

Good work!
-------------------------
filter
needed something since better pop up blocker went to hell and this so far works great knows what to and not to filter 95% of the time
-------------------------
filter
Very simple to use. This extension is better suited for novices than other ad block extensions. The options feature a simple click switch style buttons that you can select for the level of ad blocking which includes malware, spyware & others. It blocks very well as it uses the blocking lists that are used by other ad blocking extensions such as Ad Block Plus

It does indeed use less memory than other ad blocking extensions as well.

You can also custom block elements or urls. Though the process may be different than you expect. You must click on the Ad Block button, then click on "Block Ad On This Website", from there you can hover your mouse above any element which highlights it, and can ad the block rule to your user filter list. Not the usual right click as you expect. A white list is included as well so you can make exceptions for ads you do want to see.

Overall it's a good ad blocking extension. It's simple to use, & light on memory compared to other comparable extensions.
-------------------------
filter
I'm thankful to the genius adguard for protecting me from the hell of unwanted ads and banners on any website I visited. It works well according to my needs and never betrayed me ever since I started using its filter.
I feel lucky to find it for free online.
It's wonderful!
-------------------------
filter
Seems to be a ghost ad blocking software. Performs well with customized options. I downloaded its filter and linked it with its extension and received excellent results. I must say, it's 100 times better than adblock plus and other craps.
Overall, I love it!
-------------------------
filter
Best software to block ads and everything unwanted! Both extension plus filters are awesome!
-------------------------
filter
Have an excellent journey towards removing all sorts of unnecessary adverts with this tremendous ad blocker.
Uses low memory resources and performs faster.
Its active filters also keep all the malware and virus attacks away from our computers' reach.
Truly a genius development!

The best company and the best product. I loved it totally. Its a total relief if you are looking for minimalist (i mean no crappy ads) browsing experience. Its a must software tool. Its just easy to set-up and with a little tweak, you're good to go. The User Interface (UI) is easy, fluid, fast, cool. Its a free extension.

I mean what more do you want, just go and installl this extension, and if you want total minimalist (i mean no crappy ads) then do buy the paid plan for the PC version, or the Phone Version as per your convenience. Go for It.

Decent product {given the price on the entry-level version}.  
Highly modifiable, and responsive.

+Add this EARLY!  If for NO other reason than, it won't get hidden amongst the other Browser Add-In's.  This way you can easily "Whitelist" or "Blacklist" pages and save some time.
-------------------------

Awesome. The new version 3.0 that has come out is so much better than the old one version 2. I love the green GUI showing how many things have been blocked and blocked now. It looks so much nicer than old version. Also easier to use in my opinion.

OK, Pepper Jet replying to my own comment here.  Got a call back from tech support to help with the issue within a couple hours.  Wow!  These guys are really helpful for sure.

Ended up rolling back to a previous version that works better on Win XP Chrome extension and Firefox, ...yes I know, ...upgrading soon.

Wow.

I've been using AdBlockPlus for years. Tried AdGuard. What a difference.

FYI - the browser extension is full featured and FREE. You only pay for the full desktop and mobile versions. That being said, I loved the extension so much, I purchased a year for Android and Windows/Mac devices. What a great product. Keep it up guys!

using the paid version on windows and the basic on chromebook, i love it

Been using Adguard for years now. The best adblocker hands down.

I use it in conjunction with the desktop version. It does way more than simply block ads and is a security must have if one seeks to traverse the wilderness that is the world wide web ;D

Best AdBlocking extension I've seen on the Chrome Web Store. Beats AdBlock any day, and the logo looks cooler too. Nice work!
I downloaded the desktop version after and it was just as great!
-------------------------
version
Clearly better than Adblock(Plus) and etc. because it's more than adblocker, it is also an online browsing security.

I don't recommend full version to slow or below 4Gb RAM computers, it will consume high resource.
-------------------------
version
Have to give this extension a cautious 5 stars. Advice: you don't need the full version if you simply want to block ads, tracking, social media and malware effectively, so comments like 'wish this was free' are null and void. It is free, and I've tried the 'full version' to compare. There are some niggles but on balance this is more effective, and faster, than ABP or any other ad blocker I've tried in Chrome. I'm also now an 'ex-Ghostery user' - does what Ghostery does but blocks the ads as well. The UI is excellent as well. I'm no fan boy btw - I've tested them all and I'm simply sharing my current views
-------------------------
version
Love this ad blocker! 
Better than ad block:
1. Fast
2. Low resource usage
3. Good design
4. More features, like malware blocking

The other side - upselling windows version. Could be disabled in settings.

Amazing adblocker. Gives 100 of 100 score on adblocker test website. 
Hope the preconfigured settings were better though. They allow a lot of ads to pass through.
On default settings, Gives 70 of 100 score on adblocker test website.

So far it's working just fine for my environment. I specially like "whitelist" setting and it's straight-forward functionality and the "stealth" mode. Overall UI is very user-friendly. For some time I even wanted to switch to Brave browser because it has ad blocking as a default, but than I found this one so I'll stick to Chrome because of sync with all other stuff I'm using.
Thank you and keep the good work...

Installed it in Vivaldi. Blocked EVERY BANNER/AD! right away (at default settings) on the 3 test websites I view most often. I liked Vivaldi but it showed every possible ad on webpages. Now Vivaldi is perfect thanks to Adguard AdBlocker! Page size is reduced by 15% on average, so pages are not only clean now but load faster. Previously, I thought Vivaldi is slow. It is fast without ads.

This extension is REALLY EXTENSIVE: it has every possible type of filter, including Spyware Filter, which excludes the need to install additional anti-tracking extensions.

Thank you so much, Adguard team!

Seems good overall. A couple of issues though. The "allow acceptable ads" is turned ON by default (with no notification), without explaining what that would include.   Also, would be nice to be able to allow certain sites to use social tracking (like facebook) but not the rest of ads. 

Overall, fairly light, easy to use, gets the job done.

Good ad blocker, also protect from phishing pages, for example if I type .com instead of .net, it'll warn me if it a phishing page.

love it. It works great and no problems. would highly recommend it to anyone...

Took care of the in-page video ads that pop-up blockers couldn't disable. This extension is wonderful. Also improved page performance/responsiveness by not allowing these in-page ads to render.

Nice, it makes my chrome experience better, thanks a lot.

The absolute best ad blocker for Chrome. I also use their paid product for Android. Extremely effective and feature packed.

Nice, it makes my chrome experience better, thanks a lot.

This is amazing. I use it on my smartphone for Chrome and on my laptop for Chrome. Blocks almost all ads. Easy to use, stylish in Settings.

I've been installing AdBlockers to everyone in my family. AdGuard is one which worked the best. Big plus for working on Android as well. This company is the greatest. AdGuard saved me thousands not seeing the stuff they want to sell us all year long. Thank you so much, this is bargain for free.

Had this adblocker for over a year now and I had no problems with it.

I've had no problems at all. I installed it on the Chrome browser, and Opera. I was using another adblocker that was working great up until a week ago.

The good part of Adguard android app is that it also blocks ads on most of the other apps (Youtube is an exception).

Once I got Ad Gaurd, it blocked all those annoyances so pages could load faster - and I could get on with my life. Delightfully, it required NO set up. I just installed it and it went to work. Best of all, I still have full control to block or unblock whatever I want, whenever I want.  Great app!

This extension is one of the best-est present on web-store. Just configure it with 3 mouse clicks and you are done (First 3 checks and last one unchecked).YouTube ads or any other web page ads; this extension is all in one. Also it doesn't slow down your chrome as other ad-blockers do.
-------------------------
chrome
For me, AdGuard is the best ever when compared to (beggy dev) Adblock and (lazy dev) AdBlock Plus! And I find it to be much more convenient than the arguably-best uBlock Origin, because its filters properly allow certain things to work without headache-inducing investigation of what to unblock, e.g. Also it actually blocks things much better than the others on particular sites (such as adult).

AdGuard is now on-par with uBlock Origin too, finally supporting "strict blocking." And now that uBlock Origin isn't updated much anymore (well it's being severely delayed on the Chrome Store for whatever reasons), AdGuard is the new winner in my book.

One minor quirk with AdGuard is for some reason the extension occasionally crashes, requiring it to be manually reloaded or just restart Chrome.
-------------------------

for some reason, my chrome will stop refreshing. I won't be able to open pages, close. But I still love my adguard

AdGuard offers the best protection in its class. I have tested almost all Ad traffic prevention extensions on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Chromium Browser, FireFox Browser and by far Ad Guard is best in class. I have also tested in on Android Phone. It does make loading pages ad free easy and convenient. A lot of noise is reduced by Ad Guard in comparison to what things are without it.
Highly Recommend it for every device it is available.

I have never had any hassles with it nor has it been annoying to have unlike other ad blockers.
I'm quite surprised that it's even free to use, 
by the amount of options, filters and protections it offers.
p.s using Google Chrome.
-------------------------
chrome
You know, I loved using this thing.. but for SOME ODD REASON ITS DISABLED IN CHROME???? WOW OK.
-------------------------
chrome
Overall a good AD Blocker (does not block all ads but it didn't claim to either) the main thing that stands out to me is that unlike most ad blockers it prevents most - not all but nearly all sited from opening TABs on chrome or another window on your PC (like when you steam movies)
-------------------------
browser
So far it's working just fine for my environment. I specially like "whitelist" setting and it's straight-forward functionality and the "stealth" mode. Overall UI is very user-friendly. For some time I even wanted to switch to Brave browser because it has ad blocking as a default, but than I found this one so I'll stick to Chrome because of sync with all other stuff I'm using.
Thank you and keep the good work...

The best ad blocker for chrome. Its fast its secure and its simple to use. 5 stars from me
-------------------------

AdGuard seems to be working great again, new settings user interface is easy to navigate and now has some additional privacy and security features. Have this installed on chrome PC/Phones for both work and private use. Can only recommend.
-------------------------
browser
Decent product {given the price on the entry-level version}.  
Highly modifiable, and responsive.

+Add this EARLY!  If for NO other reason than, it won't get hidden amongst the other Browser Add-In's.  This way you can easily "Whitelist" or "Blacklist" pages and save some time.

chrome
If you like the chrome extension try their phone app.The best part is that it blocks in-app ads!  It'll change how you relate to the internet on your phone.Its obsessively customizable and they're always adding new features. I've been using their products for several years and cant imagine going back.  I have the full program for windows as well, but the phone app is AMAZING. All of their products are one time fee--no subscriptions.

i can't use chrome or any other browser without this Extension 
keep it guys you are the best <3

OK, Pepper Jet replying to my own comment here.  Got a call back from tech support to help with the issue within a couple hours.  Wow!  These guys are really helpful for sure.  The tech rep spent quit a bit of time with me to resolve the problem.  Ended up rolling back to a previous version that works better on Win XP Chrome extension and Firefox, ...yes I know, ...upgrading soon.  Can't say enough good things about this kind of hands on help.  They really care about their customers!  Thanks again Adguard, well done indeed.  Wish I could change my user rating to five stars.   * * * * *

The absolute best ad blocker for Chrome. I also use their paid product for Android. Extremely effective and feature packed.
-------------------------

Best ad blocker out there! 100% reliable, unlike desktop apps that you may even need to pay for! This is entirely FREE! I've been using it for a year and I've been entirely ad-free. It also blocks pop-ups as a bonus! But it really slows down your browser when you start it, that part could use some work. But, overall, I LOVED IT!!!  =D
-------------------------
firefox
Works great, removes all those annoying adds, makes my computer SO much faster, and doesn't use up all my data! Great. Even works with firefox, nice bonus
-------------------------

It works best on Chrome .

Til thin, I'll use the chrome extension
-------------------------
chrome
it even block anti ad block websites awesome keep updating the chrome app.
-------------------------
chrome
I just switched from AdBlocker. AdGuard AdBlocker is a package completer and it's free! This along side with Google Chrome's Protection and any Anti-Virus provides the ultimate protection!
Just Love it!

Wow.

I've been using AdBlockPlus for years. Tried AdGuard. What a difference.

FYI - the browser extension is full featured and FREE. You only pay for the full desktop and mobile versions. That being said, I loved the extension so much, I purchased a year for Android and Windows/Mac devices. What a great product. Keep it up guys!
-------------------------
browser
Since I switched from AdBlock to AdGuard... No more crashes of Google Chrome. Browser much faster and responsive with less ads without refreshing a page every so often. installed it on Mac and Windows.
-------------------------
chrome
One of the best chrome extensions and a huge shout out to the amazing developers of this app. I support you and really appreciate your efforts.
-------------------------
browser
The best AdBlocker I have ever used & I tried them all. If one uses too many filters it will slow down your Browser.
-------------------------
browser
works fantastic with my Windows 7 and Chrome Browser . I'm sure for some will find that it my not work. I gave AdGuard AdBlocker a try and it works the best for me.I also run Adblock for YouTube and find these two work great together.Thanks AdGuard and Adblocker for YouTube!
-------------------------
browser
I have used ADblock Plus for the longest time and it made my browser and computer slow and freezy at some times. I was looking for something which doesn't take much resources and tried Ublock origin which it claimed to do. It was not very different from ADblock plus, i was giving up on ad blocks when i decided to give this a try and i am thankful for that. I finally got the ad block that i wanted which doesn't lag down my browser and computer and all the while doing its job perfectly. Thank you for this add-on and keep this add-on just like it is!!
-------------------------
chrome
I recently had AdBlock Plus and AdBlocker for Google Chrome. Plus was very buggy, AdBlocker for Chrome was less informative about what it was blocking. Then I installed AdGuard. It TOTALLY FLATTENED AdBlock Plus and AdBlocker for Chrome! It also is a semi-antivirus software, as it can scan my computer as a desktop software. I already have good antivirus on my computer, and the two softwares together formed a faster, safer computer. Also has a cool logo:)
-------------------------
chrome
After trying 4 or 5 blockers on Edge and Chrome. I have decided to stay with this one for its easy of use. And, its ability to clean the ads without breaking the site!!! Thanks.
-------------------------
chrome
Excellent ad blocker, probably the best one currently out there for chrome, bar none. Blocks ads without breaking websites, greatly speeding up browsing experience, so yeah, very impressed and highly recommended.
-------------------------
chrome
best adblock in Chrome Store , i recommend to anyone to use this extension
-------------------------
chrome
I use it on every PC i put chrome on... and Firefox too...  Great way to block ads and malware.   I do wonder though,  what is the ACTUAL  "best" adblocker extension for chrome....  I would like to know, because i would probably use THAT one... 

but adguard is the best I know about right now.
-------------------------
browser
I don't have to worry about anything. No porn popping up, no ads that mess up the page and want to take my browser hostage. It's great!
-------------------------
browser
OUTSTANDINGLY EXCELLENT - facebook ?  all ads gone - zap !
- but you need the desktop Adguard program installed aswell to fully appreciate its awsomeness 
- you need to read for 15 minutes and setup the desktop program and this extension as suits your PC and browser
- on slow internet connection ?  sorted in no time.
-------------------------
browser
I experimented with Slimjet's 
 browser built in adblocker and store adds still visible.  Same result with Ublock origin.  After adding Adguard the store adds and Taboola were gone.  Fantastic coding guys!  I also subscribe to Adguard and the desktop application blocks ads on all browsers without needing an extension.

My first mention of Adguard in my review I am referring to the Adguard  Chrome extension which is for the 1 browser.  The desktop works across all browsers with no need for a plugin.
-------------------------
browser
Thanks a lot Adguard . You changed my browser experience a lot.
-------------------------
chrome
added Chrome to my Linux based laptop so the very first extension I HAD to add was Adguard, without question. On my windows machine,I noticed a substantial time savings when I was online when using it, so it is a must have on this system as well!
-------------------------
chrome
It works like a charm.  I have had no problems running this on Windows 7 64 bit with Chrome Version 60.0.3112.101 (Official Build) (64-bit).
-------------------------
browser
This extension is free. You're thinking of "Adguard for Windows" and "Adguard for Mac". Those are system tools, not conventional browser extensions, and you do have to pay for those after a free trial. But there's no free trial for this extension, it's free forever.
-------------------------

Perfect for Chrome on PC and Android App
-------------------------

Blocks all contents now. Please fix. Thanks.

on old versions chrome worked perfectly!

The finest adblockers on chrome extensions i have ever used . blocks ads very quickly and can be improved 
for more efficiency
-------------------------
chrome
best ad blocker ever i seen on chrome,
-------------------------
browser
Definitely a favorite, I have been using it for almost a year now and I am very pleased with the results. I Would Highly Recommend this for the average user of Chrome or any other compatible browser.
-------------------------
chrome
Pros
>Sleek, works super good on hundreds of sites, probably thousands
>I like the little green sheild icon, it's nice graphic design in my opinion
>Blocks about half of the pop-up ads
>The only adblock I would reccomend. I put it on my mother's computer.
>Sites can detect it, but it's easy to disable and it remembers which sites you've toggled it off on.

Cons
>Blocks only about half of the pop-up ads
>Sometimes, seemingly, it will block hundreds of ads one at a time until it reaches "infinity", which can make older computers running Chrome slow.
-------------------------
browser
Best AdBlocker I know of available for Chrome Browser!
-------------------------
chrome
this has been the most useful add blocker yet i went and used Microsoft edge was and was like why is there so many ads then i remembered i had this on chrome this dose everything you want for a add blocker as long as your computer is not super slow already at using webpages and your not opening 20 tabs at a time you this should work perfectly and not even notice the time difference
-------------------------
browser
Best Adblocker of all.
recommended for all browsers not only chrome
-------------------------
browser
Logged into my FB account. Surprised to see porno advertisements on my page. Did research to have them removed. Came across Google Webstore and found this site. Downloaded app. Logged back on and no more disgusting porno advertisements. Very happy with this product! Bested used on fast browsers. I am elated! Thank you Adguard!
-------------------------
browser
Best AdBlocker I know of available for Chrome Browser, small things cause browser to slow down and also with sites that require/request adblocker be disabled, some issues may arise but nothing that can't be ignored or corrected. Very good and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
-------------------------
chrome
So far the best extension on Chrome for dealing with the internet BS
-------------------------
chrome
Works well as expected. And doesn't slow down chrome like other adblockers does. Hope this stays the same and doesn't get bloated in the future.
-------------------------

Great Ad blocker. I especially love that it can block social media buttons that are always in the way. I find it does not slow down Chrome Browser at all.

I have been using Adguard Adblocker for a long time now and it Blocks not only Taboola & Outbrain but some others that aren't even listed that used to pop-up... YES on the MSN browser!
-------------------------
browser
Great little extension. Won't surf the web without it. Adguard AdBlocker is a must have. Does a fantastic job blocking malicious  advertising. I use Vivaldi as my browser and Adguard AdBlocker was one of the first extensions I added.
I only wish I could give it more than five stars.
-------------------------
chrome
Totally awesome! The extension doesn't eat up memory or slow down chrome and it is very efficient in getting rid of the annoying advertisements in youtube.
-------------------------
browser
I've tried the other ad blockers, and for my money (which is none!) this turned out to be the best...so far. I also use 'Disconnect' in my browser but some of the other ad blockers had problems with it, something about redirecting ads.

Grate program !!!! NO advert any more in my web browsing,Highly recommended,Cheap and fuly working ,can be for FREE for your Web Browser.

-------------------------

Great extension for chrome and its really works
-------------------------
chrome
Best AdBlock I've used. I come from Opera, where I've previously used this as it was recommended. I had to search specifically for this name in the chrome stored. It should definitely be more recommended.

This blocks Everything. Really, it shuts down every single ad in a page. It'll look weird at first, since the other common ones (AB+, etc) don't exactly do this. But it is awesome. Clean surfing.
-------------------------
chrome
Wonderful Block Extension Plugin. I just wish it didn't block most of my mainstream mediaplayback via chrome HTML5, js.flash and etc based webflash.
-------------------------
chrome
After using Adguard on two Android devices, I was thrilled to see it available in Chrome.  Best ad blocker I've used.
-------------------------
chrome
Google Chrome with Adguard is the ticket.
-------------------------
chrome
Noticed an improvement in Chrome loading once I switched to Adblocker from ABP. I switched from ABP because it would not block on certain sites that I frequent (especially on a forum I like to use) so I gave AA a try and so far I like it
-------------------------

Chrome browser performance improved since switching from Adblock to Adguard. I also like the loooong list of filters and annoyance removals.

-------------------------
chrome
Best adblocker i've used on Chrome, have been using it for several months. Particularly love the ability to whitelist individual filters that are part of the lists which is really handy if filter causes an issue with a feature on a site. Much easier than making and maintaining your own list without the offending filter.
-------------------------

fantastic also download desktop app which work on every browser
-------------------------

Best ad blocker you can get and its free. Nothing else will ever work this well. Adguard got down blocking ads very well. I would recommend adding this to your chrome browser ASAP.

It is the best so far. I changed all my devices to work on Chrome because of it.

I found Adguard very helpful, I was getting a bit concerned about all the going here and going there, If Chrome hadn't let all the rubbish come through I would never have known about Adguard 
 many thanks John

Perfect. Best ADblocker out there for chrome
-------------------------
chrome
Had a bunch of pop ups from various sights saying i had a virus. I panicked, thinking it was true and that Chrome wasn't protected against viruses like it advertises. Finally, i did some research and downloaded this beautiful thing of an app and i wasn't redirected to another site like before. You need this baby even if you don't get pop ups!
-------------------------
chrome
I've tried several adblockers, and I've found that Adguard is the best all-around adblocker. I had trouble with other adblockers consuming lot's of memory or seemingly slowing down Chrome, especially when I have lots of tabs open. But Adguard does it's job effectively and efficiently-- it's become a staple of my web browsing and tough to live without. You should definitely try it!
-------------------------

I've almost been going crazy with popups in chrome on my mac. Poper Blocker worked for some but Adguard seemed to have finally stopped them altogether - thank you!

Wants you to download an app to your computer that requires purchasing a license. Go with the free browser extensions such as AdBlock, Ghostery, uBlock Origin, and Flash Control. They are community driven, not a commercial venture. I uninstalled this...
-------------------------

Using this since last year .....wonderful. The only little issue i have is when i reinstall windows and sign in to chrome, it doesn't block anything i have to reinstall Adguard but regardless its awesome.
-------------------------

Adguard AdBlocker is one of the best add-on/extension you can install to your browser, you will notice the difference right away. It does what the name says, and does it very well. I would recommend this app to anyone; it’s a five star plus.

So far so good today is March 20, 2015.  I just installed Adguard extension to Chrome and have YouTube tab open--NO RANDOM ADS PLAYING in the background.  For months now I've been trying to use YouTube for educational and learning tool here at the house while going to college.  During instructional video I had to endure annoying ads from Verizon, cold and cough remedies, etc.  Keeping fingers crossed.  Good job so far Adguard.

Really useful, but I must say since I've been using Chrome I've never had so many popups. But Adgard helps me managing. Perhaps its me just getting used to what the best settings are on Adgard and my Mac.

One of the best add-ons for browsers!! Recommended for everyone!!!
-------------------------
chrome
Useful addon for chrome users..!
-------------------------
chrome
Have to give this extension a cautious 5 stars. Advice: you don't need the full version if you simply want to block ads, tracking, social media and malware effectively, so comments like 'wish this was free' are null and void. It is free, and I've tried the 'full version' to compare. There are some niggles but on balance this is more effective, and faster, than ABP or any other ad blocker I've tried in Chrome. I'm also now an 'ex-Ghostery user' - does what Ghostery does but blocks the ads as well. The UI is excellent as well. I'm no fan boy btw - I've tested them all and I'm simply sharing my current views
-------------------------

AG works as advertised,very complete and with no browser hangups. Like it better than other Chrome-based Ad Blockers.

This is the best adblocker on the block IMO. The interface is nicer and more professional than any of the other adblockers for chrome, it seems to block ads just as well, and has lower resource usage than adblock plus.

Guardio sounds like a terrible adblocker but I recommend for you to limit the amount of adblockers to only 1. Many extensions can collect your personal information (and possibly sell it) on so many levels. Look through your extensions' privacy policy to decide what to keep.

This is amazing. I use it on my smartphone for Chrome and on my laptop for Chrome. Blocks almost all ads. Easy to use, stylish in Settings. Very good, I use free 10 Mbps internet included to rent and pages are downloading so much faster now. I do not see what to buy next, not even in Gmail. This is so amazing, you all need it now. I've been installing AdBlockers to everyone in my family. AdGuard is one which worked the best. Big plus for working on Android as well. This company is the greatest. AdGuard saved me thousands not seeing the stuff they want to sell us all year long. Thank you so much, this is bargain for free.

I have used all adguard products for years. Getting the Adguard lifetime license for ones android phone should be required. Everyone I've introduced to it loves it. No ads on the internet with phishing and malware protection while saving data. Its a no brainer.
-------------------------
data
This adblocker is one of the best. I have downloaded as many adblockers as I could find and ran them individually (one at a time, no other adblockers). This adblocker worked far better than any others. I lets you set up individual rules and monitors the results. When the ads are able to violate the existing rules, it compares all recorded data, not just from your computer, but from all those who use adblocker. It will make a new filter based on the total information gathered from all other users. All filter rules created by adguard can be used, modified, or turned off by the user in order to give full control to the end users. Nice intelligent rules for either a shotgun approach or a sniper (very accurate and specific) approach. Exelent design, and full control by the user.

AdGuard is truly a guard. The best I have seen and low in CPU usage.
It is good for online security, protects against phishing sites, blocks ads and other cool features.
Great extension!

This is amazing. I use it on my smartphone for Chrome and on my laptop for Chrome. Blocks almost all ads. Easy to use, stylish in Settings. Very good, I use free 10 Mbps internet included to rent and pages are downloading so much faster now. I do not see what to buy next, not even in Gmail. This is so amazing, you all need it now. I've been installing AdBlockers to everyone in my family. AdGuard is one which worked the best. Big plus for working on Android as well. This company is the greatest. AdGuard saved me thousands not seeing the stuff they want to sell us all year long. Thank you so much, this is bargain for free.
-------------------------
delay
I've had no problems at all. I installed it on the Chrome browser, and Opera. I was using another adblocker that was working great up until a week ago. Installed another one that did absolutely nothing - then I installed this one. Not even the 'skip ad' button with a blank screen (which I got with the other one that I'd been using for a couple of years): straight to the video with no delays or drop-outs. Great extension.

This is the best Extension on earth
websites that have alot of popups are no longer lagging my computer

because believe it or not articles don't use much data as ADs and popups
anyway i will install this on every computer i see lmao...

I have been a user of Adguard for quite a long time and have also bought lifetime license for most of my devices (PC & Android). I do see a lot of difference with and without Adguard usage and definitely its a positive one with Adguard usage. I am not sure how much of user privacy is anonymous through Adguard but it definitely works a charm on the browsers am using. The good part of Adguard android app is that it also blocks ads on most of the other apps (Youtube is an exception).

The best company and the best product. I loved it totally. Its a total relief if you are looking for minimalist (i mean no crappy ads) browsing experience. Its a must software tool. Its just easy to set-up and with a little tweak, you're good to go. The User Interface (UI) is easy, fluid, fast, cool. Its a free extension.

I mean what more do you want, just go and installl this extension, and if you want total minimalist (i mean no crappy ads) then do buy the paid plan for the PC version, or the Phone Version as per your convenience. Go for It.

I can not believe how lucky I find myself after I found this gem! I was using the OTHER program that was supposed to block ads but basically were in league with ad companies!

Easy to use, doesn't hog my cpu, I'm glad I found this, because it just works

This is a must-have extension. I use Google Chrome on a Chromebook and some sites are so loaded with ads that it really slowed me down. Once I got Ad Gaurd, it blocked all those annoyances so pages could load faster - and I could get on with my life. Delightfully, it required NO set up. I just installed it and it went to work. Best of all, I still have full control to block or unblock whatever I want, whenever I want.  Great app!

Very good ad blocker, it has saved me a lot of time and my browsing speed has increased significantly, i would recommend everyone to get it.

Filter ads much better than every adblocker out their (Tested it myself) and also uses less cpu comparing to others.

This extension is one of the best-est present on web-store. Just configure it with 3 mouse clicks and you are done (First 3 checks and last one unchecked).YouTube ads or any other web page ads; this extension is all in one. Also it doesn't slow down your chrome as other ad-blockers do.
-------------------------
delay
For me, AdGuard is the best ever when compared to (beggy dev) Adblock and (lazy dev) AdBlock Plus! And I find it to be much more convenient than the arguably-best uBlock Origin, because its filters properly allow certain things to work without headache-inducing investigation of what to unblock, e.g. Also it actually blocks things much better than the others on particular sites (such as adult).

AdGuard is now on-par with uBlock Origin too, finally supporting "strict blocking." And now that uBlock Origin isn't updated much anymore (well it's being severely delayed on the Chrome Store for whatever reasons), AdGuard is the new winner in my book.

One minor quirk with AdGuard is for some reason the extension occasionally crashes, requiring it to be manually reloaded or just restart Chrome.
-------------------------
slow
My favorite thing about this adblocker is its 'inverse whitelist'. I am okay with ads that are not intrusive, annoying, or ones that significantly slow down page loading. The sites that do it 'right' I want to allow them to appear. The ones that do not, I want to block them. This inverse whitelist option allows me to do exactly that.
-------------------------

Best Adblocker around right now for Chrome. Quick and easy to sort through options and filter settings. Does not slow down a chromebook either.

at first ad blocker did really good but over time it started to throw all kind's of ad at me at ones than the computer start's to lag and than more ad's come i mean like as i'm doing this their are ad come up

ublock origin is the best, lowest cpu consumption , and it 100% blocks all twitch ads

This is probably the best ad blocker ever. The only problem is that sometimes it speeds up the loading on some websites, but also slows down some websites too. Nevertheless, it's a great ad blocker and I highly recommend it.

Best ad blocker out there! 100% reliable, unlike desktop apps that you may even need to pay for! This is entirely FREE! I've been using it for a year and I've been entirely ad-free.

I've tested four adblockers before this, and it is better than all of them. It barely slows down your device (if at all), it's completely free, and it blocks every type of ad I've seen. Not only this, but it works around anti-adblockers, and shows you what it's blocked!

As long as it continues to do the job, I am one happy camper. All the sudden I have been getting stupid adware pop ups left and right. Using the link to disable ads on site for the ones it didn't catch seems to have gotten rid of it for now. Thank you!
-------------------------

Pros
>Sleek, works super good on hundreds of sites, probably thousands
>I like the little green sheild icon, it's nice graphic design in my opinion
>Blocks about half of the pop-up ads
>The only adblock I would reccomend. I put it on my mother's computer.
>Sites can detect it, but it's easy to disable and it remembers which sites you've toggled it off on.

Cons
>Blocks only about half of the pop-up ads
>Sometimes, seemingly, it will block hundreds of ads one at a time until it reaches "infinity", which can make older computers running Chrome slow.

Installed it in Vivaldi. Blocked EVERY BANNER/AD! right away (at default settings) on the 3 test websites I view most often. I liked Vivaldi but it showed every possible ad on webpages. Now Vivaldi is perfect thanks to Adguard AdBlocker! Page size is reduced by 15% on average, so pages are not only clean now but load faster. Previously, I thought Vivaldi is slow. It is fast without ads.

This extension is REALLY EXTENSIVE: it has every possible type of filter, including Spyware Filter, which excludes the need to install additional anti-tracking extensions.

Thank you so much, Adguard team!

Superb AdBlocker. It eliminated the extremely annoying ads on Yahoo Mail which often competed with my mouse and computer for attention slowing it down by lots. Annoying indeed, i'd say. Tried other blockers but removed them as fast as i installed them. Didn't work as desired. AdBlocker does so indeed and does it silently without slowing down my already old and slowish laptop.

Very simple to use. This extension is better suited for novices than other ad block extensions. The options feature a simple click switch style buttons that you can select for the level of ad blocking which includes malware, spyware & others. It blocks very well as it uses the blocking lists that are used by other ad blocking extensions such as Ad Block Plus

It does indeed use less memory than other ad blocking extensions as well.

You can also custom block elements or urls. Though the process may be different than you expect. You must click on the Ad Block button, then click on "Block Ad On This Website", from there you can hover your mouse above any element which highlights it, and can ad the block rule to your user filter list. Not the usual right click as you expect. A white list is included as well so you can make exceptions for ads you do want to see.

Overall it's a good ad blocking extension. It's simple to use, & light on memory compared to other comparable extensions.
-------------------------

Real time protection from spamming websites, viruses, malware and many other threats!

My choice to kick-off youtube, facebook, google and other unwanted ads.

Seems good overall. A couple of issues though. The "allow acceptable ads" is turned ON by default (with no notification), without explaining what that would include.   Also, would be nice to be able to allow certain sites to use social tracking (like facebook) but not the rest of ads. 

Overall, fairly light, easy to use, gets the job done.

State-of-the-art application developed - I must profess.
Using it for the past 3 months and never had any complaint about it.

It blocks all the unwanted ads, banners, trackers and everything that can be threatening to my online experience.
Highly-appreciable!

A great extension for blocking scripts

It's great at blocking scripts and other privacy invasive elements, and does it's job well. That being said, the new window popout every time you click to change what you allow and disallow is incredibly annoying. There's no reason to have a popout like that every time, as most sites don't require that to change extension settings. A simple time delay on the new window popout would rectify this issue entirely.

prevent
I have used this extension on Microsoft Edge since it allows Chrome extensions to be added to it. NoScript does its job well. I feel safe browsing the web with this extension preventing malicious scripts from running.

Thanks for creating a great extension. I never consius on my life on this part of web that JS is killing the web it self, and thanks to this extension, I can reduce the CPU usage of my laptop on the go and also protect my identity only to some people that I trust, even it's not all, still disallow js is a great Idea. Thanks!
-------------------------
detect
This addon could be useful, but as most website use scripts, it means that you have to activate them 1 by 1 for each website that you visit. A bit ridiculous no ?
I think an addon that could detect the really dangerous scripts could be more useful !
Thank you anyway, the intention is good and it seems to work well.

I've been using this extension for Firefox since years, and now I discovered that the Sicilian Giorgio Maone is also here on Chrome! ROCKING! This is an indispensable extension, a must have tool, for your privacy, security, and blocking invasive ads.

If you were only allowed to add one extension to you browser. NoScript would be the smartest choice.      Knowledge is half the battle and controlling is the rest. You decide what a web page loads period.

I ran in the same issue. You need to install it "manually" by downloading the "RC for chrome" (is a ZIP file) and install it using the developer mode in the Chrome extensions page (Load unpacked). And now it works!
Found the solution here: https://ubunlog.com/en/si-eres-usuario-de-noscript-y-tienes-problemas-al-abrir-url-tal-vez-debas-actualizar-ya/#Cuales_son_las_novedades_de_NoScript_11218

If you were only allowed to add one extension to you browser. NoScript would be the smartest choice.      Knowledge is half the battle and controlling is the rest. You decide what a web page loads period. 
To the one that gave us this tool. Finally I can have the same kind of protection my "vintage" firefox does.   
Thanx

click
It's great at blocking scripts and other privacy invasive elements, and does it's job well. That being said, the new window popout every time you click to change what you allow and disallow is incredibly annoying. There's no reason to have a popout like that every time, as most sites don't require that to change extension settings. A simple time delay on the new window popout would rectify this issue entirely.

off
Excellent extension, a must have! 

Hats off to the developers. :)

One of my two required extensions with Chrome, I absolutely love the control and security this extension gives. Between this and uBlock, Chrome just feels incomplete without them.

The same on Tor browser for Chrome!!! NICE
tested for WebRTC leak.
-------------------------
chrome
I have used this extension on Microsoft Edge since it allows Chrome extensions to be added to it. NoScript does its job well. I feel safe browsing the web with this extension preventing malicious scripts from running.
-------------------------
browser
Great add-on! If it's recommended by PrivacyTools.io and even implemented into the TOR Browser, it's good on my book. If you haven't checked them out, they have other solid privacy recommendations.
-------------------------
chrome
This is a fantastic extension. I'm very happy that it is now on the Chrome Store. This extension assures me that I can browse the Internet freely and not worry about much.
-------------------------
firefox
if it works on firefox, then it works hear. thank yooooooooooooooooooou, noscript. I agree with you man
-------------------------
chrome
I've been using this extension for Firefox since years, and now I discovered that the Sicilian Giorgio Maone is also here on Chrome! ROCKING! This is an indispensable extension, a must have tool, for your privacy, security, and blocking invasive ads.
-------------------------
chrome
Must have, even for Brave (Chrome clone.)  Replaces their "disable scripts" native button because NoScript does it PERMANENTLY.  Works great with uBlock in advanced mode as well.
-------------------------
firefox
Great! But why it is offered by Hackademix, not Giorgio Maone (the developer of NoScript Security Suite on Firefox)?

Works great No lag or delay

cpu
Thanks for creating a great extension. I never consius on my life on this part of web that JS is killing the web it self, and thanks to this extension, I can reduce the CPU usage of my laptop on the go and also protect my identity only to some people that I trust, even it's not all, still disallow js is a great Idea. Thanks!
