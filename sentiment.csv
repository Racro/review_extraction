"been a longtime user of adblock plus and its element hiding helper, but especially over the past couple of years it has become pretty useless.

the reason? site developers are more savvy and, whereas before if i chose an element in the html and blocked it, well now, developers run php/javascripts that rotate or substitute content within that <div> or element, so the adblock works only for the moment you are on that page. if you reload the page or come back to it, boom, a new ad is there and a new element has taken its place.

meaning that advertisers are more sophisticated than the adblock developers. seems to me adblock had a good thing but then just decided to let it ride without keeping up-to-date with what advertisers (many of them lowlife advertisers) would come up with to try to get around the block.

adblock is now old news. i'm looking for something better, one that will not be outfoxed by php or javascripts that rotate ad content on every page load and which are impossible to isolate and block using adblock's filters -- even ones that i custom-write.

"corruption bug appears to have a workaround.  posted by anand bhat:

for all those having issues with the latest version showing as corrupt, try these steps:

1. install extension.

3. the top of the page will have this text -- ""this item has been disabled in chrome. enable this item"". click it.
4. extension will get activated!
